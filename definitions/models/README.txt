OGC Definitions server information models

These models define metadata attributes that OGC managed definitions require.

For some types of resources, such as OGC specifications, such attributes are often relationships to other types of resource, hence such models are expressed as OWL models.

Each model will however be visible in a Linked Data context, so should live under the managed URI redirection root /def

policy: /def/metamodel/ogc-na

Such models will, like all OWL class models,  entail an equivalent ConceptScheme to assist in Linked Data navigation and visualisation of class hierarchies.
