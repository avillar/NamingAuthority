The HY_HydroFeature feature type is defined as hydrology-specific instance of the General Feature metaclass (as defined in the OGC General Feature Model, GFM), whose identity needs to be maintained and tracked through a processing chain from measurement to distribution of hydrologic information.As an instance of the General Feature metaclass a feature type is identified by a unique identifier and typical properties. Typically, a hydrologic feature is additionally identified through names in common usage and through hydrologically significant characteristics. The HY_HydroFeature feature type is specialized into more specific feature types (Figure 23), which specify additional properties and represent particular hydrologic phenomena.Providing a standard terminology for the typical relationships between hydrologic features allows the hydrosphere to be expressed in a consistent way across multiple data products, regardless of various spatial or temporal representations.The definitions of HydroFeature feature types are rooted in the definitions documented in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology. They are applied regardless of their application context in respect to the Earth's surface. For the purpose of testing the applicability of the HY_Features conceptual model in the context of surface water hydrology, the definitions in this standard refer to surface water hydrology. A conceptual model capturing the specifics of features associated with the groundwater domain is developed with reference to the OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 – GroundwaterML2 standard.",

A realization of the logical catchment is always of higher topological dimension than the realization of the corresponding hydro nexus topological boundary.

Any hydrologically significant feature that can be identified as (said to be) the outlet of a catchment may realize the hydro nexus. Typically, this will be a permanent, stable location that is fixed and/or referenced by coordinates. Landmarks such as confluences, points corresponding to vertical sections, or the position of a monitoring station on a river are typical realizations of the hydro nexus. Other kinds of hydro nexus realizations that don't carry normal surface water characteristics as defined in this standard, e.g. a spring where groundwater enters the surface, an arbitrary point projected onto the surface, or a nexus that collects many disjoint locations may use or specialize the general HY_HydroLocation type.
