# OGC Naming Authority Repository

This is the main OGC-NA repository. It will hold the following:

* definitions 
* draft policies and procedures

Approved policies and procedures are published at https://www.ogc.org/standards/na

The OGC Definitions Server is an online registry that allows for the management of resources such as terms, definitions, vocabularies and other related resources that are defined in OGC standards. The resources are recorded in registers that conform to Linked Data principles and are published through the definitions server. The definitions server provides a resolvable HTTP URI for each registered resource, thereby making it possible to uniquely identify the resource. The definitions server is intended to facilitate semantic interoperability between different systems that use OGC standards. 

The OGC Definitions Server can be accessed at http://www.opengis.net/def/

More information about the OGC Definitions Server can be found at https://www.ogc.org/def-server

Presently, the 'OGC Naming Authority registers' of the Definitions Server include among others Sensor Model registers and a list of authorities for definitions endorsed by the OGC, while the 'OGC definitions' list Observation Types and includes the Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus.
