Introduction 

This discussion paper has two broad goals. Firstly, it will investigate the core 

requirements for an information model which describes the results of hydrological 

observations, focusing on time series. This will be done by analysing existing data 

standards for hydrology, or closely related domains. It will be shown that existing 

standards contain concepts that are sufficiently aligned that a harmonised view may be 

developed.  

Secondly, the discussion paper will provide an approach for developing a harmonised 

core conceptual model for hydrological observations. It is proposed that such a model 

provides a basis for, in the first instance, generating an XML Schema and accompanying 

documentation.  

The explored approach will focus on re-using existing open standards and information 

modelling best practices. Re-use allows development to focus on the domain specific 

problems rather than re-solving commonly addressed issues. Developing a standard that 

is usable to a wider audience improves the ability for communities to share tools that 

address common needs such as encoding and decoding of a standard schema.

Harmonising Standards for Water Observation Data 

For in-situ hydrological observations 

1 Scope 

This document investigates the potential for harmonisation of water data standards, 

with the goal of developing an OGC compliant standard for the exchange of water 

observation data. The work will be based on OGC‘s Observations and Measurements 

abstract model [10-004r2] . The goal is to create an O&M profile for the water 

domain.  Development of the OGC compliant O&M profile will begin by examining 

the content and structure of existing standards and suggesting future methodology for 

developing a harmonised model for observation data. This approach will make use of 

existing standards where possible.  

The focus of this document is in-situ style observations (which are generally related to 

water quantity). Ex-situ measurements, such as those common to measuring water 

quality, will be addressed in future work.

Figure 1 — UML notation 

In this document, the following three stereotypes of UML classes are used: 

a) <<Interface>> A definition of a set of operations that is supported by objects 
having this interface.  An Interface class cannot contain any attributes. 

b) <<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent 
existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no 

operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information. 

c) <<CodeList>> is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a 
list of potential values. 

In this document, the following standard data types are used: 



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  5 
 

a) CharacterString – A sequence of characters 

b) Integer – An integer number 

c) Double – A double precision floating point number 

d) Float – A single precision floating point number 

5 Motivation 

There is a global push within information communities for the development of 

consistent information models for the capture of spatial and temporal data and 

metadata. The current state of data existing in ‗stove pipes‘ is seen as inconsistent, 

inefficient and a major barrier to improving interoperability of information systems.  

A worldwide initiative, Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), has 

the goal of developing a system to allow world-wide integration of observation data to 

improve our understanding of the global environment. The Geo 10-year plan outlines 

issues with data availability: ―…the current situation with respect to the availability of 

Earth observations is not optimal. This situation is particularly true with respect to 

coordination and data sharing among countries, organizations and disciplines, and 

meeting the needs of sustainable development.‖ [GEO2005] 

Within the US there are programmes and initiatives to promote data sharing and re-

use through the use of standards and Web Services for information exchange. For 

example the Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences Inc. (CUAHSI) 

has developed a number of schemas and technologies to facilitate improved sharing of 

hydrological data sets. 

Within Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) is developing an Australian 

Water Resources Information System (AWRIS), with the goal of obtaining a deeper 

understanding of the current state of water resources across the country. This is 

resulting in developments that are addressing data standards within the hydrology 

community. The Australian Government‘s Water Act 2007 [AUSWA2007] empowers 

the Bureau to collect and set standards for water information across the country.  

In Europe, the Water Information System for Europe (WISE) is developing a gateway 

for water information with the aim of providing data to the public collected by 

institutions across the member countries. More broadly in Europe, the Infrastructure 

for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) initiative has the 

directive to develop an EU wide spatial data infrastructure for sharing spatial data 

sets. The directive states: ―The loss of time and resources in searching for existing 

spatial data or establishing whether they may be used for a particular purpose is a key 

obstacle to the full exploitation of the data available‖ [EU2007]. Specifications 

defined by the WISE should, in parallel, progressively be adapted to INSPIRE global 

rules and also serve has a basis for the INSPIRE themes modelling. 

These initiatives are dealing with the large scale complexity of disparate data sets and 

all are working on improved standards for water information. This type of information 



OGC 09-124r2 

6                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

covers both spatial and temporal data sets, each of which has its own level of 

complexity. In order to avoid re-solving well understood issues with handling such 

data, most initiatives are looking to leverage existing standards and methodologies 

where possible [EU2007] [GEO2005]. The International Standards Organisation 

(ISO) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) are two bodies that define 

standards directly relevant to the issues being addressed.  

The OGC and the World Meteorology Organisation (WMO) have recently formed the 

Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG) [LEM2008] which is a forum for the 

collaboration and development of standards for hydrological data. This group has 

members from countries dealing with similar issues of developing and reusing 

standards.  

An international workshop held in Australia on Water Resources Information models 

in September 2007 [COX2007] indicated some of the benefits of developing shared 

models were: ―…improved efficiency and quality of local information models and 

systems; wider use and re-use of information; new tool development, and new value 

from existing information via unexpected uses‖. This workshop suggested the 

development of a harmonised information model and transfer formats for water data.  

5.1 Structure of this document  

Section 6 gives an introduction into the type of observations that occur within the 

hydrology domain, continuing into an overview of the need for the exchange of such 

data sets.  

Section 7 of this document will give an overview of existing relevant standards; firstly 

standards associated with methodologies for developing information models and 

secondly existing standards for hydrological information. Sections 7-10 examine these 

standards in each of four core areas: results, features and sampling, procedures and 

observed properties. From this analysis the discussion paper will outline a core set of 

requirements for an information model for hydrological observations. These are 

summarised in section 15.  

Section 16 and onwards proposes an approach for developing a core conceptual model 

for hydrological observations. This approach will make use of existing best practice 

and standards by examining projects that have employed similar techniques. This 

model should be extensible to suit particular requirements for the exchange of 

hydrological observations. Adoption of such a model is discussed in section 18. 

6 Hydrological Observations 

―Water is found on Earth in significant amounts in all three of its physical phases: 

liquid, solid, and gaseous. It is also found in all three of Earth‘s major environments 

that are readily accessible to humans: the atmosphere, the seas and oceans, and the 

land masses. Because water can readily move from one environment to another and 

can change from one phase to another in response to its environment, it is a dynamic 

medium in both space and time.‖ [WMO1994].  

The field of hydrology focuses on the water cycle as it interacts with land; 

hydrological observations are performed in order for us to increase our understanding 



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  7 
 

of this interaction. Such observations can occur at any point within the hydrologic 

cycle, each employing different techniques for making measurement and estimates of 

water quantity and quality.  

 

Figure 2 – The hydrologic cycle [ENE2009] 

The WMO Technical Regulations [WMO2006] define concepts and standard types of 

observations typically made within the hydrology domain as well as relevant 

observations from other domains such as climatology and meteorology. The 

classifications defined are useful in separating the various categories of hydrological 

observations as they represent not only different observed phenomena but also 

different sampling techniques.  

The regulations break hydrometric stations into the following categories: 

(a) Hydrometric stations; 

(b) Groundwater stations; 

(c) Climatological stations and precipitation stations for hydrological purposes; 

(d) Hydrological stations for specific purposes. 

From these categories they define the types of phenomena that are recommended to be 

measured. The following lists show an adapted summary of these:

The WMO specifications are not exhaustive but are written as a guide to standard 

observational practices. They give an indication of the types of observed phenomena 

that are crucial to the hydrology domain.  

The Global Terrestrial Network – Hydrology (GTN-H) is a joint project of the Global 

Climate Observing System (GCOS), the World Meteorological Organization / 

Climate and Water Department (WMO/CLW), and the Global Terrestrial Observing 

System (GTOS). It is aimed at linking observation networks on a global scale. GTN-H 

requires the description of hydrologic datasets (metadata on data and data products) 

across scientific disciplines. The applicability to different disciplines of the hydrology 

domain requires modularity, and first of all a common understanding/meaning of 

definitions, terms and names.  

Based on WMO and national guidelines different countries have developed their own 

categorisations for water information. These differ from country to country, mainly 

due to different driving concerns for water management at a national level. These 

concerns drive the funding for water management at a national level which implies 

particular types of observation networks receive a higher level of attention. Droughts 

in Australia, shipping waterways in Germany, reliance on aquifers in parts of the US 

are all examples of different national concerns that we see reflected (sometimes) in 

national funding schemes.  

For example, the Australian Water Regulations [BOM2008c] categorise water 

information into the following categories: 

1. Surface water resource information 

2. Ground water resource information 

3. Information on major and minor water storages 

4. Meteorological information 

5. Water use information 

6. Information about rights, allocations and trades in relation to water 

7. Information about urban water management 

8. Information about water restrictions 

9. Water quality information 

10. Descriptive and reference information about water information in other 
categories 

Water quality is often regarded as a separate definition entirely to ‗water 

observations‘, being termed water quality monitoring by WMO and water quality 

information within the Bureau.  

The WMO definitions are broader, with the grouping of hydrometric stations 

including measurements on storage levels which is a separate category (3) within the 

Bureau regulations. The Bureau‘s definitions also define phenomenon that may be 



OGC 09-124r2 

10                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

derived from observation data such as storage volumes. The WMO definitions are 

slightly different in their intention, defining observable phenomena at stations, where 

the Bureau defines types of information products of interest to a national water 

system.  

These types of observations vary not just in the particular phenomenon they are 

observing, but also the techniques employed to make an observation. The technique 

used has important implications that affect how often people make such observations 

as well as where they make them. For example, water quality observations often 

require laboratory analysis in which a person may take a sample from a site and return 

it to a specialist for analysis; this generally implies a higher cost and will thus occur 

less often. Contrasting this to a river level gauge connected to automatic telemetry 

device where measurements can be made every 15 minutes and relayed periodically to 

a central data repository. This allows greater granularity in time but is also restricted 

to a single location unless the equipment is moved.  

 

For the purposes of the initial phase of development of a harmonised model for data 

exchange, we define three broad categories that will be addressed separately:  

 

Observation style Description 

In-situ, fixed observation style Generally temporally dense, spatially 

sparse, small number of observed 

phenomena. Examples: river level or 

stage, river discharge, storage level, 

rainfall etc. 

Ex-situ, complex processing observations Temporally sparse, spatially sparse, many 

observed phenomena. Examples: 

nutrients (nitrate, phosphorus etc.), 

pesticides (atrazine, glyphosate etc.), 

biologicals, pH, turbidity etc. 

Complex data products These consist of processed or synthesised 

observational data, mainly created to 

provide estimation of not directly 

measurable phenomena or predictions of 

future values. Examples: outputs from 

models or algorithms, water storage 

estimates, calculation of complex 

physics-chemistry, biological indices 

(French : IBGN, German/Austrian : 

Saprobic Indice, …). 

 

These definitions are not clear-cut; it is possible to have water quality measurements 

that are made continuously by in-situ measurements (such as dissolved oxygen, 

turbidity etc.). Similarly, storage volume may be viewed as a complex data product as 

it often involves the integration of survey data and estimation algorithms. Exchange 



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  11 
 

formats addressing category 1 may be capable of capturing data within category 3, but 

representation of the procedure used to generate the data set implies extra 

requirements on metadata (if it is to be supported through transfer). Generally, the 

more complex the process of making the measurement, the less likely it is to be 

available as a continuous observation.  

The focus of the remaining discussion is on the first category of observation styles 

(in-situ). Such observations are generally associated with measuring water quantity 

(storages, river flows etc.). The other categories will be covered in future work.  

 

6.1 Need for exchange of observational data  

The driving need for the exchange of water observation data is varied and operates on 

different levels, from intra-agency sharing to sharing across international borders. 

Sharing is increasingly important in areas such as Europe, where initiatives such as 

the Water Framework Directive (WFD) have been setup; an initiative that led to the 

development of the Water Information System for Europe (WISE).  

Traditionally the impetus for the exchange of data has been for reporting requirements 

arising from across agency collection of data sets. More recently the development of 

enabling technologies, such as distributed computing and web services, have allowed 

for data to be shared with a broader audience. In addition to this is the increasing 

demand of cross-disciplinary research to access previously inaccessible data sets, such 

as climate science, where scientists attempt to merge data sets from a wide variety of 

influencing factors such as oceanography..  

In 1999 the WMO adopted Resolution 25 which states: 

―a stand of committing to broadening and enhancing, whenever possible, the free and 

unrestricted exchange of hydrological data and products, in consonance with the 

requirements of WMO’s scientific and technical programmes.‖ 

This Resolution led to a report on the exchange of hydrological data and products 

[WMO2001] which explores the requirements for data exchange and defines three 

typical categories of data products: 

(i) Data for the ―…the provision of services in support of the protection of life 
and property and for the well-being of all nations.‖ 

(ii) ―additional hydrological data and products, where available, which are 
required to sustain programmes and projects of WMO, other UN agencies, 
ICSU and other organizations of equivalent status, related to operational 
hydrology and water resources research at the global, regional and 
national levels.‖ 

(iii) ―all hydrological data and products exchanged under the auspices of 
WMO, for the non-commercial activities of the research and education 
communities‖ 

These have a WMO perspective (i.e. international), but the categorisation goes further 

to describe principle uses of hydrological information globally as: 



OGC 09-124r2 

12                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

1. Real-time applications: forecasting and warning of floods, low flows 
and other extreme events; 

2. Real-time applications: project operation; 

3. Engineering design; 

4. Hydrological and environmental science; 

5. Monitoring trends in the global environment. 

The report describes operational hydrology (primarily items 1, 2 & 3 above) as 

generally being performed on the river basin scale, where items 4 and 5 may require 

international exchange of information. It is noted that international exchange may 

need to occur in the first three cases where there are shared river basins across the 

borders of countries. In heavily used regions this may lead to the formation of multi-

country commissions to manage cooperation, such as the Rhine Commission.  

The report also describes the ―…increasing but often imprecisely defined requirement 

for the international exchange of data - particularly for research and monitoring 

programmes that consider variability and trends in the global atmosphere, climate 

and environment.‖ 

It should be noted that [WMO2001] comments that the hydrological community has 

not been confident in stating the requirements for data or products to be addressed 

under Resolution 25; it therefore ―…acknowledges the diverse requirements of data 

users in different circumstances, in terms of variables and parameters, measurement 

precision, frequency of observation, timeliness, and other data attributes.‖ Guidance 

is provided, however, suggesting the technical regulations [WMO2006] such as those 

mentioned in section 6, merely state observations that should be made at particular 

stations rather than a full set of requirements for the exchange of data products.  

The Water Framework Directive‘s key aims are summarised as follows[WFD2010]: 

 expanding the scope of water protection to all waters, surface waters and 
groundwater; 

 achieving "good status" for all waters by a set deadline; 

 water management based on river basins; 

 "combined approach" of emission limit values and quality standards; 

 getting the prices right; 

 getting the citizen involved more closely; and 

 streamlining legislation. 

All of which require varying levels of cross-border sharing of water information.  

A report from the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GCOS) on the establishment 

of a Global Hydrological Observation Network for Climate [GCO2000] provided

some synthesis of requirements for hydrological observation data and identified five 

major drivers for exchange: 

1. Improved Climate and Weather Prediction 

2. Characterising Hydrological Variability to Detect Climate Change 

3. Developing the Ability to Predict the Impacts of Change 

4. Assessing Water Sustainability as a Function of Water Use Versus Water 
Availability 

5. Understanding the Global Water Cycle 

7 Relevant standards 

7.1 Standards and best practices for information modelling  

In a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [OMGa] approach, a domain modeller 

captures a conceptual model of an information system with a formal modelling 

language such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) [OMGb]. UML allows 

construction of an abstract graphical representation of information artefacts and their 

relationships using diagrammatic elements that have well defined semantics. From 

this model it is possible to generate specific implementations of the model, such as the 

eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schema [W3Ca] or database schema.  

Combining MDA with existing standards, the ISO Technical Committee 211 has 

developed standards and methodologies to support the development of information 

models for Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). The ISO19101 model is the reference 

model for the 19100 series on the development of geographic information standards; 

it, along with ISO19109 (rules for application schema), outline a methodology for 

developing conceptual models and application schema with a goal to improve 

interoperability. Note that geographic information is defined as ―information 

concerning phenomena implicitly or explicitly associated with a location relative to 

the Earth‖ [ISO19101]; hydrological phenomena fit into this category. The INSPIRE 

project has taken the IS019101 approach in defining a methodology for developing its 

standards for data exchange.  

The methodologies described in ISO19000 define rules for the use of tools such as 

UML for creating conformant conceptual models that have explicit relationships to 

other platforms such as XML. This allows construction, sharing and composition of 

standards in UML, removing the complexity of dealing with XML Schema or other 

implementations. 

The INSPIRE project has developed broad methodologies for the development of 

common information models to promote data sharing and re-use across the EU: 

―…a key step in the data harmonisation process is to achieve interoperability on the 

conceptual level (semantic interoperability) so that users and implementers of 

different information systems can understand the semantics of the relevant 

information provided by the other system(s). ― [INS2007] 

Whilst the INSPIRE project is focusing on spatial data sets, the general methodology 

for harmonisation is relevant to developing information models for observational data 



OGC 09-124r2 

14                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

sets. The Observations & Measurements (O&M) model from OGC is within scope of 

INSPIRE and suggests that temporal data will play a role in the specification of 

INSPIRE‘s information models.  

Model-driven approaches to information modelling are also being investigated within 

the Microsoft Active Data Objects (ADO) framework through its Entity Framework 

[MSEF] concept. This uses a conceptual model to define element structure, 

relationships and constraints. Using this framework a conceptual model is built using 

a tool called the Entity Data Model, which is similar to UML. Mappings can be 

created to underlying storage mechanisms (databases, schema etc.), allowing 

automatic generation from the conceptual model to a particular storage type. This 

generation of schema is still being developed. It will allow information to be modelled 

without artefacts that are specific to the underlying storage technology, creating a 

cleaner separation of concerns.  

There are other model-driven frameworks emerging such as the two open source 

products, AndroMDA [AND2009] and Hibernate OOMEGA [OOM2009]. 

A large, actively developed standard that uses a model-driven approach is GeoSciML. 

The standard is used to describe geologic features with an emphasis on geological 

information for use in portraying geologic maps. The project has been a driving force 

in the development of tools to support MDA approaches to information modelling, 

such as the HollowWorld [HOL2009] and FullMoon [FUL2009] toolsets.  

7.2 Observations and Measurements (O&M)  

The OGC Observations and Measurements (O&M) standard is the point of 

convergence of a range of ISO TC 211 and OGC activities [BAC2007].  

OGC has been developing a suite of specifications relating to observational data, 

known as Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)[BOT2006] that complements the generic 

access models provided by WMS, WFS and WCS. The distinguishing element of 

observational data is that the procedure used to obtain the data, and the resulting 

uncertainties, are of interest to data users.  

O&M extends the existing ISO-specified models with the components related to 

detailed provenance and uncertainty issues, which are necessary to manage and make 

use of observations.  

A growing list of application communities (including Geology, Climate Science and 

Water) have evaluated the formalization of observation and sampling information 

provided in O&M and have committed to implementing data-transfer and even 

database systems based on it. While the analysis required for this is often challenging 

initially, the rigorous and explicit model, and its integration in the ISO/TC 211 and 

OGC methodology is expected to provide significant benefits in interoperability and 

sustainability, with its modular rather than monolithic basis.  

O&M‘s conceptual model defines an observation as ―…an action whose result is an 

estimate of the value of some property of the feature-of-interest, obtained using a 

specified procedure.‖  [COX2007b] 



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  15 
 

This model provides a separation of the elements involved in observations as well as 

defining the relationships between them. By separating the core elements of 

observation descriptions, we have a basis for exchanging, and discussing, 

observational data sets.

Figure 3 - Observations and Measurements UML model 

Part 2 - Sampling Features of O&M [COX2007c] defines a sampling model for 

capturing cases where the actual target of an observation is not the ultimate feature 

but a proxy for measuring a property of the feature. It introduces the concept of a 

sampling feature that is the proxy for the measurement. This sampling feature has a 

relationship named sampled feature, which is the real world feature being observed. 

The O&M model can be used to describe hydrological observations, and the sampling 

features section helps to describe common observation patterns in the domain. The 

sampling features concept does not describe ‗domain features‘ such as lakes and 

rivers, but the intermediate process that occurs in observing them. Such intermediate 

concepts are often call stations but may include profiles or other sampling dimensions.  

For example, a river level gauge is actually sampling the height of a river at a 

particular point (a gauging station); this observation is providing an estimate for the 

‗ultimate feature of interest‘ which is the actual river height. The sampling point here 

would be the gauging station.  

An example of a hydrological observation using this model is shown using UML in 

Figure 4. This diagram shows three river flow observations, each at a different station, 

ultimately measuring two rivers. These use a calculation to estimate the river flow. 

There is another observation provided by a sensor measuring the temperature of the 



OGC 09-124r2 

16                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

river. All have time series as their results, described here using discrete coverages 

[COX2008].  

 

Figure 4 - Example sampling feature relationship 

Sampling feature collections are also defined, allowing for logical groupings of 

sampling points. Such groupings of sampling points are common within hydrology, 

but are often given different names. Sometimes a ‗site‘ is a collection of ‗stations‘; 

another view of a ‗site‘ is a collection of measuring ‗locations‘. The conceptual 

grouping is generally similar but naming convention differs widely. These groupings 

may also have relationships to larger, spatial groupings such as catchments, 

hydrologic units etc. Defining approaches to correctly capturing such relationships 

within hydrological data sets is an area requiring further work.  

The O&M concepts can easily be adapted to describe hydrological observations. For 

example, observing salinity in a lake will produce salinity in mg/L (result) which is an 

estimate of the salinity (observed property) in Eagle Lake (feature of interest) using 

salinity meter 00435 (procedure) [WAL2009].  



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  17 
 

O&M can be compared to the model at the core of the Observation Data Model 

(ODM) [TAR2008]. ODM similarly defines a separation of the core elements 

involved in the observations, with a specific focus on hydrological observations, 

shown in Figure 5.  

 

Figure 5 - The ODM model for hydrological observations 

The ODM takes a more data centric viewpoint when compared to the broader 

observation view that O&M takes. Elements such as the description of the observation 

procedure are built upon the ODM model whereby O&M contains it as a core feature 

of its model. The differences have implications for how data is interpreted by end 

users and systems.  

7.3 Standards for hydrological information  

Existing standards for hydrology data all have a different focus, driven by a particular 

need for standards in a particular context. This paper examines significant standards 

of relevance with the aim of capturing core requirements for hydrological 

observational data. A broader survey of existing standards has been performed in 

[LEF2008].  

Below is a brief summary of existing standards of interest to this paper and how they 

may be relevant to the harmonisation process.  

7.3.1 ArcHydro 

ArcHydro [MAI2002] is a data model (Figure 6) for Water Resources and has focused 

on surface water with input from key state, national, and international contributors. It 

is implemented as a geodatabase schema. It is widely utilized within the hydrologic 

community. It is simple and designed to be extended by the users of the data model. A 

toolset based on the ArcHydro data model is available for ArcGIS desktop 

applications. The data model presented for time series information only covers the 

basic information that is needed for analysis. 



OGC 09-124r2

The ArcHydro data model is undergoing revision to better incorporate ―series‖ into 

the model. Four additional conceptual information sets are being added: time series 

(in the original), feature series, attribute series, and raster series.  

 

Figure 6. ArcHydro 2 conceptual model 

7.3.2 WaterML1.0 

The Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences Inc (CUAHSI) has 

developed the WaterML standard, now in version 1.1, which allows for the encoding 

of hydrological observations via their WaterOneFlow web services. The initial driver 

for the development of WaterML1.0 was ―… to encode the semantics of hydrologic 

observation discovery and retrieval and implement water data services in a way that is 

both generic and unambiguous across different data providers, thus creating the least 

barriers for adoption by the hydrologic research community.‖ 

WaterML1.0 is implemented as an XML schema and does not currently make use of 

OGC or other existing standards. The semantics utilized are from the CUAHSI 

Observations Data Model [TAR2008]. One of the future goals of developing a 

harmonised observation model is to allow WaterML1.0 to converge with existing 

standards.  



OGC 09-124r2

7.3.3 Australian Water Data Transfer Format 

The Water Data Transfer Format (WDTF) is currently being developed by the Bureau 

of Meteorology and CSIRO as part of the water information research and 

development alliance.  It forms part of the Bureau of Meteorology‘s AWRIS software. 

The scope of the format is to allow for the encoding of information that must be 

supplied to the Bureau from state water agencies or organisations that take 

hydrological measurements. The standard not only addressed observational data, but 

also descriptions of features (storages, water courses), transactional information (for 

synchronising with a data warehouse), conversions (e.g. a rating table conversion) and 

water quality samples. Version 1.0 includes groundwater observations.  

This format makes use of the O&M specification, through a simple features GML 

profile [ISO19125-1] that restricts certain aspects such as the available geometries and 

complexity of types. It also uses GML for spatial types.  

7.3.4 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – Water Quality Exchange 
(WQX) 

WQX is focused on the exchange of water quality information. It is based on the 

Environmental Sampling, Analysis, and Results (ESAR) data standard [ESA2006] 

which was developed to facilitate the sharing of laboratory result data. EPA also 

provides a validation service that allows for documents to be validated against the 

schema definitions.  

The WQX standards are developed by the Environmental Data Standards Council 

(The Council) which is comprised of ten members from Tribes, States and US EPA. 

The Council‘s primary function is to develop and adopt Data Standards - documented 

agreements on terms, definitions, and formats - when there is an environmental 

business reason. Version 2.0 of the standard is used by the US EPA, and the USGS to 

deliver water quality information over web services and REST interfaces. 

7.3.5 XHydro 

XHydro is an XML dialect developed as an exchange format for hydrological data. Its 

purpose is to standardize the transmission of time series data between sensor, data 

logger, central data node and long time data archives. The development of XHydro 

was initialized by the Federal Ministry of Transport Building and Urban Affairs in 

Germany (over the hydrological advisor group of the Federal Waterway and Shipment 

Adminstration) and coordinated with different stakeholders such as the German states 

and industry partners). It was developed in 2007 by disy Informationssysteme GmbH 

and KISTERS AG and tested by the German Federal Institute of Hydrology. 

XHydro is more than a XML based exchange format for hydrological data in that it 

specifies an XML schema for the encoding of generic time series, with an extension 

that is tailored specifically for water level and discharge data. The time series model is 

the key point of interest. The development process was influenced by different 

architectural goals which are of interest for the harmonization process. 

Besides the generic schema approach, XHydro has a modular design. To reuse parts 

of the XHydro schema in other schemes is simple. Examples of the extendibility are  



OGC 09-124r2 

20                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

 the definition of code lists which are often domain specific and differ from 
organization to organization; 

 the use of extension elements (typeless elements and attributes of the XHydro 
base types) without a redefinition of the schema; 

 the use of concrete XML schema data types, especially for enumerations as 
implementation for the code lists which allows to partially test the validity of 

the content of the exchanged documents.  

Because the compactness of the transferred documents is a special requirement for the 

communication between sensor, logger and central data node, XHydro offers two 

XML schema implementations which differ only in the tag names. An XSLT 

stylesheet provides an easy transformation between the two implementations of the 

data model.

Figure 7 - The XHydro time series model 

Figure 7 [XHY2007] gives an overview of the key elements of the content model. 

XHydro time series are multi parameter time series, which means that it is possible to 

transmit multiple property values with one time stamp. It offers an implemented 

support for isochronous (constantly increasing in time) time series without the need to 

deliver a time stamp for every single data value. Instead, the distance between two 

observations is given as an attribute of the time series. Because different systems 

often use different identifiers, XHydro includes a multiple time series ID

(exchangeId) element. Further elements of relevance are the sections of parameter 

definition, aggregation methods, location and data quality.  

7.3.6 KISTERS 

The Kisters Group develop commercial software for the management of hydrological 

data sets, with their products being used worldwide. Time series are a core aspect of 

the functionality provided by their products: WISKI, Hydstra and TimeStudio. 

KISTERS AG developed XHydro and EA XML as well as harmonised the time series 

data exchange between their products for the Water and Energy Market (KiTSM).  

7.3.7 UK Environmental Agency time series data exchange 

The UK Environmental Agency developed the EA Time Series Data Exchange 

Format (UK-EA-TS) to address the need ―…to exchange a variety of sets of time-

series data with both internal and external stakeholders‖. The primary type of time 

series were hydrological data types such as lake and reservoir levels, river levels and 

flows, and rainfall. 

The standard addresses: 

 Rainfall amounts 

 River levels and flows 

 Tide levels 

 Lake and reservoir levels 

 Groundwater levels 

 Areal modelled evaporation, soil moisture deficits, etc. 

 Continuously monitored water quality parameters: e.g. dissolved oxygen and 
ammonia quantities 

 Climate station data: e.g. temperatures, wind speed and radiation. 

7.3.8 The French National Service for Water Data and Common Repositories Management 
(SANDRE) 

The SANDRE system provides national infrastructure for sharing water information 

within France. Its architecture is based on the use of a common language for water 

information that has defined standards for a number of areas of both spatial and 

observational hydrological information. It has made use of ISO and OGC standards, 

using ISO19115 for its metadata definitions and a number of OGC service interfaces 

for exposing data assets. The information models developed within this project are 

well developed and in active use and are thus of particular interest to the 

harmonisation process.  

Sandre uses a MDA approach: starting from UML to generate XML Schema to enable 

exchange of data via webservices. Sandre is not using ISO 19100 framework but is 

progressively switching its model to OGC standards; work has already be done on 



OGC 09-124r2 

22                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

moving referential datasets (surface waters, WFD water bodies, …) towards GML-

based schema. 

Sandre is using the Pressure-State-Response framework developed by the OECD. 

Under the ‗State‘ element all the possible measurements carried out on water have 

been added: quality (biology, hydromorphological, chemical, physicochemical), 

quantity. This, combined with a typology of the medium: Coastal/transitional, surface 

(river, lake), ground waters etc, leads to the monitoring station category, e.g. river 

quantity monitoring station. 

The main combinations obtained (Surface/Ground  - Quality/Quantity) have their data 

dictionary, code lists (controlled vocabulary), exchange scenarios and web services. 

7.3.9 The Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI) 

The OpenMI Association (www.openmi.org) develops and maintains the Open 

Modelling Interface, an API standard to facilitate time step based data exchange at 

run-time between models and other components.  

The OpenMI has emerged from the hydrological domain in Europe, but is now 

utilized around the world to connect models and modelling frameworks from different 

suppliers and research groups in the wider environmental domain (agriculture, 

hydrology, marine/coastal, land use, climate, economics). Its latest version (2.0) is due 

to be released in 2010.  

The center piece of the data model is the ExchangeItem (Figure 8), holding values 

organised along the same axis as the ODM: time, space and variable. The ElementSets 

interface provides a single point of entry for id-based and geo-referenced spatial 

model representations expressed as points, poly lines or polygons, the latter possibly 

layered. Time is expressed in modified Julian dates. Variables are defined as 

quantities, having a unit of measurement and associated base dimension, or as 

qualities, i.e. categorizations of e.g. soil types. The actual values are objects.

Figure 8 The OpenMI data model 

The OpenMI is developed in UML, and implemented as abstract interfaces in the 

.NET and Java languages. With its application scope from HPC to ‗simple‘ linkages, 

it is likely to remain an API which will become more suitable for deployment in web-

services in the near future. Another future extension is to standardize the connection 

to ontology‘s to allow flexible use of data dictionaries. 

7.3.10 The DelftFEWS Published Interface 

Operational forecasting agencies around the world use DelftFEWS to conduct 

hydrological related forecasts such as river flow (floods and water supply), storm 

surge, groundwater levels, water quality and harmful algae bloom. To accommodate 

this domain range, the DelftFEWS Published Interface has been defined as a standard 

to exchange forcings, model states and model data sets/parameters to the 

computational models conducting the simulation [DEL2010]. The standard defines 

scalar time series in XML, gridded timeseries in NetCDF (CF convention), meta-data 

on model states and model data sets in XML, while the states and model datasets are 

exchanged in native format. Figure 9 provides the XML schema of the time series 

exchange format.

7.4 Other standards of relevance  

There are a number of existing standards that are of interest for their approach on 

either using other standards or solving similar harmonisation issues. The aspect of 

each model that is relevant is outlined.  

7.4.1 SWE Common  

Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) is a group within the OGC that develops standards 

associated with encoding and transmitting sensor data as well as other functions such 

as providing sensor descriptions, control, alerting and processing. There is a common 

specification within SWE, known as SWE Common, which defines re-usable data 

structures and types such as data records, arrays and techniques for defining 

phenomena and more. O&M makes use of parts of this specification as to other 

standards within the SWE group.  

7.4.2 Climate Science Modelling Language (CSML) 

CSML makes use of the ISO coverage model extensively for its modelling of the 

result sets for climate science. These are often gridded data sets but also cover time 

series data. CSML also leverages existing OGC standards such as GML and SWE. 

They also employ the MDA approach to developing information models.  

7.4.3 Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) 

IOOS is ―a federal, regional, and private-sector partnership working to enhance our 

ability to collect, deliver, and use ocean information.‖ [IOS2009]. The Data 

Integration Framework initiative within IOOS is focussed on improving management 

and delivery of ocean observation data. The project is using a number of open 

standards for information structure and web service delivery. They have made use of 

the O&M, GML and SWE Common to develop an information model suitable for 

ocean observing systems.  

7.4.4 Ground Water Mark-up Language (GWML) 

GWML makes use of GeoSciML to define a model for capturing information on 

groundwater, with a focus on the definitions of features. It has used similar model-

driven approaches to developing the model and as such can be used as a reference for 

methodology.  

7.4.5 The Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC) Hydrologic Datasets - metadata profile 

The GRDC operates under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation 

(WMO) and is developing a metadata profile to describe hydrological data sets. They 



OGC 09-124r2 

26                                                                  Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

have used a model-driven approach to the development of this standard, with close 

alignment to the ISO19115 metadata specification.  

The profile also makes use of the O&M model to define observations and their 

associated properties. This specification is of interest for its use of standards as well as 

its definitions of hydrographical features and observation procedures.  

7.4.6 Marine Metadata Interoperability 

The mission of the Marine Metadata Interoperability (MMI) project is ―To promote 

the exchange, integration and use of marine data through enhanced data publishing, 

discovery, documentation and accessibility.‖ The project is funded by the National 

Science Foundation (NSF) but has been supported by a number of other international 

organisations. The project has published a number of relevant outputs on the 

description and handling of metadata in distributed environments. These ‗guides‘ 

provide guidance on the use of metadata standards, URI schemes, controlled 

vocabularies and semantic techniques for data mark-up.  

8 Harmonising core concepts 

8.1 Defining existing concepts  

In order to harmonise on a model for hydrological observations, this paper will 

analyse the components of existing standards and define a core set of properties that 

must be represented in a common model.   

The focus of this analysis is on the first category (in-situ, fixed observation style) of 

data identified in section 6 but other areas such as descriptions of features, processes 

and other areas will be touched on. Hydrological data sets contained within the other 

identified categories of data, such as rating curve descriptions, gauging measurements, 

and water quality, will be addressed in future work.  

The following table rates existing standards along axis of interest for harmonisation. 

The scores are not just based on ability but on relevance within each area to the goal 

of a conceptual model for hydrological observational data. This is not a general 

qualitative rating for each standard.  

The + ratings give a relevance score for each standard against each aspect of the 

O&M conceptual model. This allows us to focus on particular aspects of each 

standard to identify concepts for harmonisation. For example, GWML is a standards-

driven model with some areas of interest in its definition of features and procedures, 

but does not have relevance in terms of encoding time series.  

Each aspect of the table is described as follows: 

Results: the generated values of an observation (e.g. time series) and the metadata 

describing the result structure. (ODM: DataValues) 

Features: descriptions of the real world objects involved in the observation (e.g. 

gauging stations, rivers, lakes etc.) 

Procedures: the process involved in making an observation (e.g., turbidity sensor, 

water level measurement method etc.) 



OGC 09-124r2

Properties: the phenomena that are the subject of observation (e.g. water level, 

rainfall etc.)

Table 1 - Relevance of standards to the harmonisation process 

- = Standard does not contain a relevant approach to the concept 

+ = Standard at least contains a reference to the concept 

++ = Standard defines the concept partially  

+++ = Standard provides mechanisms for full description of the concept 

Table 1 indicates that most identified standards can contribute to various aspects of a 

common model. In this document the focus will be on WaterML and WDTF for 

results, with EK-EA-TS, XHydro, Sandre and FEWS providing extra inputs. Further 

revisions of this document may incorporate contributions from other standards. It is 

useful to have a number of standards when looking at the result model to see the 

variety of interpretations of time series that exist.  

For feature definitions, there are broader standards available such as the INSPIRE and 

GRDC models with their definitions of hydrographical features. Most models make 

reference to external procedure definitions through identifiers, but a few provide 

partial descriptions of the underlying process types; such as the GRDC profile and the 

IOOS Data Integration Framework.  

The next sections will address each of the areas of concern in turn, taking into account 

the appropriate standards for analysis of concepts and approach. The initial focus of 

harmonisation has been the definition of results.  

9 Results 

As defined in section 6, the in-situ style of hydrological observations primarily 

produce a time series of values that represent an estimated value for a given 

phenomenon at a particular time (or across a time period). The focus of this section is 

to investigate a consistent model for representing hydrological time series.  

9.1.1 Time series 

Time series values can have a different relationship to the temporal spacing in which 

they occur. The differences come about either through different measuring processes 

(e.g. a sensor) or the result of post-processing a time series (e.g. result of an 

aggregation calculation). Capturing the relationship between points is important when 

interpreting the values for analysis or further processing.  

These time series types are particularly important when one is to perform 

interpolation between time series points in order to estimate the value of a 

phenomenon where no measurement occurs. A re-usable information model within

hydrology must make explicit the type of data that is being represented; it must also 

be sufficiently precise to allow other models to map their structure onto this model.  

9.1.2 Existing time series models  

The concepts that are captured in the existing standards provide a baseline set of 

requirements that need to be investigated for a time series model.  

The following examples show the time series encoding section of existing standards. 

The examples shown are not encoding the same data; they are provided from the 

specifications and only contain time series descriptions.  Full examples are listed in

9.1.3 Time series metadata comparison 

The following table provides a summary of the concepts that each format is capturing 

with a description of where the property has been modelled. The concepts within the 

table were identified as being present across a number of the existing standards. The 

concepts are all related to the ‗result‘ structure within the Observations & 

Measurements model, which we are defining as being a time series for the purpose of 

the initial phase of definition.

9.1.4 Per value vs. per time series properties 

One of the common structural differences of the compared properties for time series is if 

they are defined per value, or if the property holds across a full time series. WDTF has 

used a default property pattern where one is able to specify for the whole series the 

default value, or define individually for each value. The need to define properties per 

time series point arises from characteristic changes within the series. WDTF employs this 

for interpolation type, processing code, quality and unit of measure. This model is a 

useful trade off between flexibility and verbosity of the encoding.  

SANDRE implemented a similar pattern, where there are per time series and per point 

properties defined where required (e.g. quality information), but only per series for 

properties that hold across a full result set.  

The ways in which per value vs. per series properties are structured have implications for 

the discovery process. These will need to be investigated further.  

9.1.5 Qualifiers 

The use of qualifiers outlined in Table 2 shows there are different interpretations of the 

meaning ‗qualifier‘. The use varies from describing environmental influeces of a 

measurement to a relative position of the meausuring location (e.g. ‗downstream stage‘) 

to more general qualitative descriptions. For example, FEWS PI uses qualifiers as a 

further identifier for time series, allowing sub series to be defined using an extra 

dimension (in addition to location and observed property, for example). WDTF has a 

separate property (observationConditions) that define potentially influencial conditions 

occurring whilst the measurement was taking place (e.g. pumping occurring). The various 

uses require deeper analysis in order to define a re-usable common definition.  

9.1.6 Interpolation Types 

One of the core aspects of time series is the relationship between the value and its 

associated time instant (or period). This relationship is determined by the procedure that 

was used to make the estimate that the value represents. In most data models this is 

referred to as the data type or interpolation type.  

Whilst it is possible to provide a placeholder to allow users to specify the interpolation or 

data type of a time series within their given context (through code lists), it is important to 

understand the way existing standards deal with this concept, as it is pivotal for correct 

interpretation of a time series, consistent post-processing and summary statistics .

XHydro: contData 

UK-EA-TS: Instantaneous 

FEWS PI: Instantaneous 

A continuous time series indicates 

the observation result is the value of 

a property at the indicated instant in 

time. The points are essentially 

connected and interpolation may 

occur between points in order to 

estimate the value of the property 

between points. The appropriate 
time spacing between successive 

points to mimimise interpolation 

errors is related to rate of change 

(wrt time) of the property.

The sampling of the property occurs 

such that it is not possible to regard 

the series as continuous. The time 

between samples is too large to 

classify the measurements as 

continuous.

measuring pH.

9.1.18 Handling cumulative data 

Data of type instantaneous total is often accumulated across a period to show the running 

total since accumulation commenced. This is often the way in which rainfall data is 

reported (e.g. total rainfall from 9am to 9am – 24 hours of accumulated instantaneous 

total data). Existing models handle this concept slightly differently; Table 4 and Table 5 

give a summary of some of the mechanisms employed to handle these concepts. 

WaterML1.0 and UK-EA-TS captures accumulation as a separate data type where as 

WDTF designates at a time series level whether the series is accumulated. UK-EA-TS 

and WDTF store the accumulation begin and end points to allow for correct de-

accumulation to performed.

9.1.19 Note on reporting intervals 

When values are being attributed to a certain time interval, it must be made explicit 

which part of the interval the value holds over. It may be the value represents the 

beginning of the observed value for the interval or the end of the interval.  

WDTF makes this explicit in the data type by specifying whether the value holds over the 

preceding interval or the succeeding interval.   

CUAHSI ODM defines the value at a particular time represents the beginning of the 

interval. This is represented as succeeding interval in WDTF. The justification from 

ODM is as follows [TAR2008]: 

―Data types 4 to 8 above apply to data values that occur over an interval of time. The 

date and time reported and entered in to the ODM database associated with each interval 

data value is the beginning time of the observation interval. This convention was adopted 

to be consistent with the way dates and times are represented in most common database 

management systems. It should be noted that using the beginning of the interval is not 

consistent with the time a data logger would log an observation value. Care should be 

exercised in adding data to the ODM to ensure that the beginning of interval convention 

is followed.‖ 

XHydro separates this definition into a time stamp qualifier that specifies whether the 

time stamp represents the start, middle or end of the interval.  

As stated in the ODM specification, loggers generally report the value at the end of the 

period of measurement but it should be possible to accommodate each type.  

For aggregated values, such as rainfall, WDTF uses ―accumulationPeriodicAnchorTime‖ 

to indicate the base time of the interval, XHydro uses ―offset‖ for this purpose. WDTF 

uses ―accumulationPeriodicIntervalLength‖ and XHydro makes use of ―interval‖ to tag 

the duration of the recurring interval.

9.1.21 Timing metadata 

Existing standards define a number of timing metadata elements that relate to various 

temporal properties of time series. It is important to clarify some different concepts in 

terms of hydrological time series. The names given here are for descriptive purpose only.  

 Reporting frequency: The time sampling regime of the observation. For a sensor, 
this would be the frequency of sensor measurements (e.g. 15 minutely); for 

manual observations this would be how often the observation is recorded, for 

example daily temperature checks. Termed spacing in the ODM specification 

[TAR2008].  

 Download/update frequency: Describes how often a data set is unloaded from a 
logger or other recording device. This may not be captured and is often not 

relevant to exchange formats, but is important for understanding update cycles.  

 Regularity: This describes whether the time distance between points is 
equidistant. It is often used for performance and compression techniques in 

systems storing or transmitting data. This can be determined by examining the 

data set. 

 Spacing (waterml1.0): The interval that the sample is measured. For 
instantaneous, the value is zero. For daily observations, the sampling interval 

would be 1 day. This is needed because there may be daily datasets which are 

averaged over a 5 or 7 day period.    

 

In the CUAHSI ODM specification, the idea of support scale is introduced, which 

contains three components as identified from Blöschl [BLO1995] [BLO1996]. These are 

extent, spacing and support.  

1. Extent is the temporal extent over which the values occur (i.e. start and finish 
times of the time series).  

2. Spacing relates the distance in time between each point. This is essentially a 
descriptive component as it may be derived by looking at the values. However 

this information may be useful when discovering data sets to get an idea of the 

regularity of the measurements. Note that this may actually be different than the 

sampling frequency that is described in a description of the sensor or procedure 

making the measurement.  

3. Support relates to the time distance between points (as described above).  
A harmonised model of the above concepts would allow for clarification of the concepts 

across standards.  

9.1.22 Null Points 

It is often the case in hydrological time series that a point will exist but has been marked 

as a null point. There are a number of reasons that a data point may be flagged as null or 

missing and sometimes the semantics of this indication is only known to a particular 



OGC 09-124r2 

56  
 

system (e.g. a point may be indicating that between this point and the next null point no 

interpolation should occur).  

Often systems include point comments to indicate the nature of the null point. The system 

may flag the values as null due to some particular processing that has occurred (e.g. a 

phenomenon has exceeded allowable limit). Null points may also carry particular 

semantics within a system, such as being an ‗anchor‘ point for the calculation of total 

values. This point would indicate that it is the first point where the accumulation period 

has begun.  

WDTF allows null values to be expressed using the xsi:Nil attribute (through defining the 

element as nillable). XHydro also takes this approach.  

WaterML1.0 uses the concept named NoDataValue in order to identify a value that will 

represent null points in the context of a document. This is driven by an often used 

technique within agencies to use special values to represent null values. Using this 

technique allows for the particular usage information to be conveyed, but if no technique 

exists then an arbitrary number must be assigned as a stand-in (typically at either extreme 

of the supported numeric scale).  

Sandre has defined a ―NumericOrNull‖ data-type, which is a union of a double or a null 

token. Management rules stated that NULL values automatically create a new series, this 

implies that no null value stored. 

The KISTERS time series model distinguishes between a hard missing and a real null 

value. A missing value is flagged by a reserved quality of 255, where as a null value 

simply is not available. A missing value has an interpolation property and it produces a 

gap according to the interpolation type that is set. Reasons for missing data points are 

stored as a grouped standard remark. The standard remarks are added to the quality 

―missing‖.  

In future definitions of null values it would be useful to include a property outlining the 

reason for a null value. This is something GML captures through its definition of a Nil 

Reason Type which elaborates on why the value has been omitted.  

9.1.23 Values 

For hydrological observation results the values for each time series point are generally a 

measurement that indicates an estimate of the observed phenomenon. This is largely the 

case across the four core hydrological standards under review with the addition of 

categorical values that are supported in WDTF, WaterML1.1 and XHydro. XHydro 

provides the data-types ―float‖, ―char‖, ―bool‖, ―integer‖ and ―anyType‖ for values and 

adds the ability to embed binary content, such as images, through the use of MIME types.    

9.1.23.1 Accuracy  

WaterML1.0 allows for the specification of accuracy per time series value. This is 

captured as a double value indicating the standard deviation of the measurement.  



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  57 
 

XHydro (KISTERS) also allows for the specification of accuracy through its data quality 

definition. It is represented as a decimal value. 

Sandre does not make accuracy available for surface quantity monitoring. 

SWE Common provides a mechanism for specifying the qualitative values for each 

measurement. One of these may be a specification of the accuracy of a value.  

This gives us the ability to encode ―values of precision, accuracy, tolerance, and confidence 
level.‖ [BOT2007] 

The example below shows two ways in which this approach may be used.  

 

<swe:quality>  
    <swe:QuantityRange definition=" urn:ogc:def:property:OGC:tolerance2std">  
        <swe:value> -0.02 0.02 </value>  
    </swe:QuantityRange>  
</swe:quality> 
 
<swe:quality> 
    <swe:QuantityRange definition= "urn:ogc:def:property:OGC:absoluteAccuracy"> 
        <swe:uom xlink:href="urn:ogc:unit:percent"/> 
        <swe:value>-0.5 0.5</swe:value> 
    </swe:QuantityRange> 
</swe:quality> 

 

This approach is flexible in that it allows users to specify the particular qualitative 

properties that may be of interest, but this implies there should be a set of well know 

definitions of accuracy measures that may be used in order for people to interpret the 

meaning correctly.  

9.1.24 Data Quality 

Data quality is obviously a commonly represented property. The use of code lists here to 

constrain possible types is common across the standards, with some providing extra 

metadata alongside a code. Sandre defines a specific datatype to assess the quality of a 

hydro year for a given site.  

The flexibility of quality descriptions within a standard is often determined by how it will 

be used in a target system. For example, the KISTERS calculation framework can 

include/exclude points based on rules specific to quality indicators. If a system requires 

quality information to correctly structure it internally, then it raises certain requirements 

to the feeding format.  

Harmonising on quality code definitions is something that will not be attempted in 

defining a core model; arguments over common models for data quality have raged long 

in many data communities. The concept will exist in the model, but will be left for 

organisations to specify for their context. A comparison of the available types is supplied 

in Appendix A.  



OGC 09-124r2

9.1.25 Comments 

Per point comments are common occurrences within hydrological time series, describing 

notes from the field or particular information regarding corrections, shifts or editing that 

may have occurred to the data. As shown in Table 2, WDTF and UK-EA-TS have the 

ability to capture time series point comments.   

The KISTERS model distinguishes between individual comments and standard 

comments. The standard comments are registered and may receive values by the user. 

10 Features and sampling features 

As described in section 2.1, O&M breaks features into two categories:  

 Sampled features: natural, real world features (rivers, storages, dams etc.) 

 Sampling features: features involved in the sampling process (gauging stations, 
bottles, specimens etc.) 

Most hydrological data is linked directly to the station where observations are made. The 

site name will sometimes contain the name of the river being measured, but the 

connection between the station and the actual river is sometimes implicit in the data 

(through its coordinates, identifier system etc.) or in an internal system the data is stored 

in.  

For observational data to be incorporated into broader SDIs, it is important to improve 

definitions of links to actual features that are being measured. This is also important for 

hydrological modelling, where river networks and flow processes are key in model 

development.  

WDTF has adapted O&M to fit the structure in use by the Bureau where by a site may 

contain many sensors, all measuring at different locations. This hierarchy is achieved 

through the use of the SamplingPoint and SamplingGroup concepts.  Each sampling 

group is defined with its properties (name, location, time zone etc.) and each sampling 

point is associated with this group. This allows for flexible spatial groupings to occur.  

WaterML1.1 links observation data to individual sites which represent the location of the 

measurement being captured. Groupings of sites are achieved through the concept of a 

network which is defined as ―a collection of sites where a particular set of variables is 

measured‖ [VAL2009b]. This also allows for similar flexible spatial groupings to occur.  

Sandre defines the notion of networks that stations can belong to, all of which have 

various objectives such as flood warning, water police. Stations can be linked through 

parent-child relationships.  

Further work is required on defining features specific to the hydrology domain. There are 

a number of existing standards that may be utilised here, currently the most relevant are: 

 INSPIRE data specifications [INS2008], specifically: 

o Hydrography 

o Environmental Monitoring Facilities

 GRDC metadata profile for hydrologic datasets [DOR2009] 

 Australian Hydrologic Geofabric [BOM2008]  

 ArcHydro data model [MAI2002] 

By making use of similar model-driven and standards-based approaches of these projects, 

the ability to create connections between observational data sets and the spatial domain 

which they reference becomes easier.   

The GRDC metadata profile describes hydrographic features and their relationships.  For 

example, Figure 10 shows the relationship between basins, catchments and rivers, 

lagoons, reservoirs etc.

Figure 10 – Basins UML in the GRDC profile 

By re-using the GRDC model, O&M descriptions of observations can be linked to the 

relevant spatial features. Figure 11 shows an example of how this may be done using an 

example of a flow observation at a site on a river. The elements in green represent 

components in the observation process from O&M; those in blue are instances of classes 

from the GRDC metadata profile.

Figure 11 - Example river flow observation in UML 

A literal reading of the example gives, ―A doppler flow meter was used to make a flow 

measurement of the Macquarie river at the Macquarie at Trefusis station. The result of 

this observation was a time series. The Macquarie River is in the South Esk Basin.‖ 

The example does not show the properties of all the classes involved (such as observation 

times, results etc.) but these exist within each of the class definitions and would be 

described explicitly when encoding occurs.  

The process is shown as a generic O&M process instance (being a doppler meter). The 

GRDC profile does define some specialisation of process types such as instrument, so 

these classes may also be used. The following section addresses procedure descriptions 

further.  

The Sandre information model reflects a similar approach. A site can have several 

stations, with each station being able to have multiple sensors. The site is described 

using: 

 X,Y coordinates 

 National code from the watercourse link 

 Linear referencing (start and end point of the watercourse link) 

 Altitude information 



OGC 09-124r2

 The links to the water bodies and/or basin can be defined.  

11 Procedures 

The description of the process used to generate an observation result can vary in 

complexity. Raw observational results generated from sensors undergo internal 

processing to convert signals into parameter estimations; time series are generated from 

chains of conversion processes to convert units or estimate related phenomenon; models 

link complex process chains to provide past and future estimates for phenomenon. This 

information is useful when interpreting data sets to gain further insight into the nature of 

the estimation.  

The existing standards analysed provide some categorical grouping of the types of 

processing that occurred on a particular data set, but they generally don‘t provide a high 

level of metadata that could be used for further interpretation (i.e. to provide estimates of 

uncertainty in data).  

Within the OGC Sensor Web Enablement suite of specifications the SensorML 

specification is a schema for describing in detail the processes that occur when sensors 

and instruments take in creating estimates of phenomenon. It is a very flexible schema, 

and there is need to investigate its use, a subset of it, or alternate specifications, for 

describing fully the procedure used to generate hydrologic observation results.  

There is an activity within the W3C call the Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group 

which is currently developing ontologies to define the capabilities of sensor and sensor 

networks [W3Cb]. This group is also looking at approaches for providing annotations 

within existing standards to link to well specified description of sensor capabilities.  

The GRDC metadata profile provides some initial work in this area, with its 

specialisation of the O&M procedure and separating instruments and simulations (models 

etc.). Further testing of this model will be required to determine whether it is capable of 

matching current and future requirements.  

11.1 Derived time series  

The CUAHSI ODM allows for grouping and derived from associations to be created. 

This concept can be used to provide metadata describing how a particular time series may 

have been generated. A group of values may be associated with another group from 

which the series was derived. This association can then be linked to a method identifier 

which describes the process that was undertaken to generate the derived values. 

Essentially this is modelling two concepts: process chains and describing dependencies 

between data sets.  

This grouping and dependency tracking is a common requirement in hydrological data, 

where there are many derived data products that have dependencies both to other data 

sets and to algorithms (defined as category 3 data in section 6). Maintaining the 

relationship between time series for when dealing with sharing of data requires a common 

(or at least transparent) identifier system; this allows series to be cross referenced and 



OGC 09-124r2 

62  
 

resolved appropriately. Further investigation should be done in capturing a common 

model for such requirements.  

There is a difficulty managing the identity of data values when externally processing 

information in a program or model that does not fully support a data model. Operating the 

processing chain over a grouping, or series, and maintaining relationships between groups 

requires less information and allows for external processing operations.  

The Sandre data model makes a clear distinction between a ‗series‘, being a raw data set, 

and a ‗elaborated hydro observation‘ which represents a processed or derived data set.  

The KISTERS model provides a raw data series and a ―production‖ data series. The 

production data series contains the best data ―for algorithm and purpose‖, such as for 

stage-discharge computation (cross parameter calculation) or aggregations (summary 

statistics).  

12 Observed properties  

Observed properties relates to the definition of the phenomenon that is being observed. 

Hydrological observed properties are generally phenomenon such as water level, river 

flow (or discharge), turbidity etc. Exchange formats may want to refer to well defined 

lists of possible observed properties or describe the nature of the observed property inline 

in an instance document. Both models should be supported.  

There are differences in the definitions of what constitutes an observed property across 

existing hydrological standards. This appears to be mainly due to the way the underlying 

model has captured the various components of observations.  This is an area that requires 

further harmonisation and will be within scope of defining a harmonized model.  

WaterML1.1 uses the ODM concept of a variable, which links the observed property, 

units of measure and the temporal sampling regime being used (e.g. regular hourly 

intervals). It is also possible to specify the medium being sampled (e.g. surface water, air, 

ground water etc.). Additionally, it includes series information, like interpolation and data 

type, and meta-information about the variable such as general category and no data value. 

In the HIS discovery system [HIS2009], an ontology is used to link variables to concepts. 

Sandre also uses the concept of the ―observed property‖ (based on a codelist) for the 

surface water quantity monitoring, whereas concepts of parameters are mainly used for 

quality monitoring dictionaries. 

WDTF mainly uses the referencing of controlled terms approach to defining its property 

types. It does have the ability to provide an inline description that sets a unit against a 

particular observed phenomenon. WDTF also provides a mechanism for creating 

compound properties that links to phenomenon through a mapping. This has been used to 

allow for the definition of rating (conversion) tables (compound property defines the 

level to flow mapping). It is not currently used to create time series of compound 

phenomena where one may want to define a single time series structure that applies 

across a number of observed properties.

12.3 Potential future approach 

When defining local property definitions the SWE Common approach is quite flexible. It 

allows property definitions to be used that are appropriate for the context of use. For 

example, a US agency serving information for the National Water Information System 

(NWIS) may encode their property definition as follows: 

 

  <om:observedProperty> 
        <swe:Phenomenon gml:id="NWIS_00060"> 
            <gml:description>Discharge, cubic feet per second</gml:description> 
            <gml:name>00060</gml:name> 
        </swe:Phenomenon> 
    </om:observedProperty> 

 

Or alternatively, the definition could be referenced via xlink using an identifier: 

 

<om:observedProperty xlink:href="http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/pmcodes/00060"/>

It would be optimal if this identifier could be resolved to an equivalent definition of the 

property. This will depend somewhat on the governing body of the definitions, but having 

such definitions available allows for a more consistent use by data providers.  

13 Linking to code lists and ontologies  

The concept of linking out to definitions is to allow a clear reference to be made to a well 

governed definition of a concept. Often the concept that is being represented contains 

information that is important in correctly interpreting a data set, but it is not feasible to 

define the semantics of this along side the data. This case is commonly seen in the use of 

controlled vocabularies or code lists where an identifier is used for a well-defined concept 

within an organisation or its operating context. For example, an organisation may define a 

set of common data quality identifiers that categorise some qualitative information, such 

as the USGS qualification for instantaneous values: 

 

Table 7 - USGS codes for instantaneous values 

Code Description 

e The value has been edited or estimated by USGS personnel 

A The value is affected by ice at the measurement site. 

B The value is affected by backwater at the measurement site. 

R The rating is undefined for this value 

& This value is affected by unspecified reasons. 

K The value is affected by instrument calibration drift. 

X   The value is erroneous. It will not be used. 

<   The value is known to be less than reported value 

> The value is known to be greater than reported value 

The link from the identifier to the underlying concept is done through the code identifier 

(e.g. ‗R‘). On its own the identifier is fairly meaningless, but it may be contextualised by 

a link that provides the definition of the concept.  

An organisation adopting an existing standard for data exchange will want to continue to 

use their own set of codes for particular concepts. Re-usable schemas must therefore be 

able to use a different set of definitions without version changes. A recommended 

approach to adapting a schema for use should be provided by the standard definition or at 

least by best practice documents.  

True interoperability between information systems can occur only when it is possible to 

either translate exactly between codes from different organisations or a common set of 

codes are adopted.  While this is the goal, it is realised that significant advances in 



OGC 09-124r2 

66  
 

interoperability can occur even when there is only a common format capable of housing 

those codes. 

The Semantic Web [W3Cb] community is interested in making connections between how 

data relates to real world objects. An ontology [WIK2009] is one technique available for 

defining the nature of real world objects and their relationships. A number of information 

modelling groups are looking towards using ontologies, and linking to them, to allow data 

to be connected with its conceptual meaning. There are some existing approaches on how 

best to ‗mark-up‘ data with appropriate connections to such ontological definitions. 

The Marine Metadata Interoperability (MMI) project recommends usage [ALE2009] of 

URLs for defining links to terms within ontologies. If this target URL is resolvable then 

one could retrieve the definition of the term within a hierarchy of related definitions.  

The suggested structure is as follows: 
http://{hostdomain}/{ontologiesRoot}/{authority}/{version}/{resourceType}/{shortName} 

Following such a definition, an example could be encoded as follows (referencing a 

CUAHSI ontology for surface hydrology to define stream discharge): 

<om:observedProperty xlink:href=" 
https://svn.sdsc.edu/repo/WATER/CUAHSI/OntologyOwl/StarTree_Current/ontology/surfhydrosyn/ 
dischargeStream"/> 

Current work within the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks incubator group [W3Cc] is 

investigating techniques for marking up data with links to its semantic meaning. They 

provide an example on a weather compound phenomenon [COM2009] linked to an 

ontology describing the components making up weather observables: 

 

 

Figure 13 - Example link to weather phenomena within an ontology 

 

SWE common provides sufficient linking mechanisms (through use of xlink) to define 

links to ontologies using this approach. Dictionaries that are local to the schema can be 

defined, and these may be generated from catalogs that are used as the definitive source 

of the definitions. The actual approach used will depend upon the end user of a schema; 

descriptions of recommended approaches would be useful.  

14 Grouping observations 

The O&M model describes individual observations that capture the relationship between 

the observed property, the feature of interest, the procedure and the ultimate result. 

Grouping of observations is important when handling transmission of observation series, 

for example as responses to web services or other query interfaces. Often such groupings 

are called series (WaterML1.0), datasets (GRDC metadata profile) or collections.  



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  67 
 

O&M version 1.0 contains an observation collection definition that allows for grouping 

of multiple observation descriptions. However, this definition may not be included in 

subsequent versions. The basis for this decision is that the description of collections is not 

a part of the observation description, merely a convenience for transmission of 

observational sets. These types of structure are of significance when defining a service 

interface to the model.  

CSML defines a dataset class, allowing for: 

 Spatial extent summary of the grouping 

 Local dictionary definitions of coordinate reference systems, phenomenon, units 
of measure 

 Description of multiple features (and coverages). 

Grouping in WDTF allows for description of  

 Features 

 Document metadata (versioning, data owner, document generation etc.) 

 Local phenomena definitions 

 Transactional information 

 Specimens 

 Conversions 

 Observations. 

Within WDTF, a grouping does not necessarily imply there is a relationship specific to 

the type of observational data contained. As it a transfer format, the observations that are 

contained within the group are merely determined by the approach a user has taken when 

exporting their data set. The observation data contained within a document explicitly 

define relationships through the use of identifiers. For example, these identifiers may 

relate sets of observations through common features of interest (i.e. spatially exist at the 

same ‗site‘). WDTF also employ specific objects to group entities.  For example a 

DurationGroup which defines the temporal use of rating tables at a gauge through a 

temperal list of rating table identifiers.  The rating tables themselves are defined in other 

object or may not even appear in the same document. 

Grouping in WaterML1.0 is based around the interface used for discovering data. 

Observation groupings are called series (a unique combination of site, variable and time 

intervals). A location has group of series called a series catalog. Since locations can be 

shared, it is possible to have more than one series catalog, although this has been 

deprecated. Within the CUAHSI HIS, series are essential to the discovery process. A 

central metadata catalogue of series allows for the discovery of information across data 

providers. A series catalog is a group of series that is defined for a site. This is used for 

discovery purposes through the GetSiteInfo service call in WaterOneFlow. Time series 

are grouped in time series response documents which results from a GetValues service 

call.  



OGC 09-124r2 

68  
 

Grouping structures of observations are often developed from the viewpoint of how 

people discover observational data sets. Within OGC the service model built around 

accessing O&M data is the Sensor Observation Service (SOS). This service has a concept 

of ―offering‖ that allows for grouping of data sets along with interface calls for discovery 

and filtering of concepts.  

Groups are important to the management of the information, and they often reflect how 

the information is collected and managed. For streaming data, United States data 

providers manage data streams as ―site-variable-begin date-end date‖ which it calls 

―period of record‖. This differs from a water quality collection model which uses a 

project-site-methods-results grouping. This water quality model is reflected in the WQX 

standards used both by the EPA, and the USGS. Functionally equivalent to the 

series/period of record concept are ‗availability records‘ for a particular location-variable. 

These are used by agencies, such as the National Climate Data Center, and the National 

Resources Conservation Service. SOS provides a mechanism that is called ―offering‖ but 

since grouping outlined above can have millions of records it is not possible to use in 

SOS 1.0 to expose large numbers of ―offerings‖. 

A conceptual model for hydrological observations needs to provide a standardized 

mechanism for discovering time series groupings. Periods of records/offerings/series are 

presently basic practice when exposing hydrologic information.  The CUAHSI HIS 

system has demonstrated that such groupings allow for discovery of information.  

In Sandre‘s data model one can create complex/compound observations but the link to the 

initial series is not tracked down. 

15 Summary of requirements for a core water observation model 

This section provides a summary of requirements for a core model and provides guidance 

for future work on harmonising, and developing, future standards for exchange of water 

information. It is not a comprehensive list and further engagement by a wider community 

will help to identify areas that require extra work.  

Results: The core properties that were identified in this report include: interpolation 

types, quality, value qualifiers, accuracy, processing metadata (linked to procedure 

definitions), textual comments, units, null values, temporal metadata. Adapting these into 

a specialised O&M result model and testing against a number of exchange requirements 

is underway. The focus of this report is on time series; other observation types do occur 

in hydrological observations, such as geometric observations of river cross sections – 

these will need to be addressed further.  

Feature descriptions: mechanisms for linking to feature descriptions should be 

provided. Full descriptions may be supported by linking to existing information models. 

Certain usages patterns require different levels of metadata, unpacking these will be 

important future work. For example, an information model to support a flow forecast 

model has higher requirements on network descriptions than a rainfall reporting service.  

Procedures: Current metadata is limited in existing standards. Linking to external 

descriptions should at least be possible. Further investigation of a common approach for 



OGC 09-124r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  69 
 

specific hydrological processes is needed, addressing processes such as hydrologic 

models, complex conversions (rating curves, volume calculations etc.) and sensor 

descriptions. The procedural information is often closely related to the result types and 

associated metadata; understanding different viewpoints and needs of observation data 

will assist here. Procedure descriptions assist greatly in downstream interpretation of data 

sets; this is an area that is not currently well supported.  

Groupings: Grouping observation sets is important for discovery purposes. Existing 

standards are built around end user needs of discovery – these should be analysed further.    

Flexible code lists: ability to link to existing code lists for particular agencies is a 

common requirement (see section 13).  

Observed properties/phenomenon: SWE common provides an initial approach to 

capturing the definitions of observed properties. There is a need to harmonise on the way 

relationships are drawn between observed phenomenon, results and procedures (which 

O&M provides guidance on) – existing standards group concepts together slightly 

differently and the core components need to be separated in a consistent manner.  

Readiness for expandability: A key requirement is the ability to introduce extensions to 

the schema to match future requirements that may arise. A modular design is a good 

approach to achieve this goal. Also the model should be open for extensions by arbitrary 

user-specific data. 

XML-compliance: All data of an XML-document must be strictly XML-compliant (in 

contrast to a string with an internal CSV-like structure), to ensure that their formal 

integrity can be verified by standard XML-validators (like Xalan). 

 

15.1 Encoding types 

The existing formats investigated are all based on XML encodings for data exchange. 

Current practice for data exchange of hydrological observations hinges largely on the 

exchange of CSV and Excel spreadsheets. These formats often have minimum metadata 

and often rely on apriori knowledge of opaque conventions and identifier systems. XML, 

whilst sometimes verbose, allows easier machine interpretation of data sets and increases 

the capability for self describing metadata when linked to schema.  

Other communities, such as the climate sciences, use existing standards such as netCDF 

[UNI2009] that allow for efficient encoding of large data sets such as gridded surfaces. 

There is current work [GAL2009] on using netCDF (and specifically CF-netCDF, a 

climate and forecast extension) as an encoding through OGC services such as the Web 

Coverage Service [WCS2007]. These types of initiatives are of interest as they are 

supporting existing community standards but attempting to adapt them to technologies 

and standards that improve our ability to share and interpret data sets. It also may be 

possible to generate encodings of a common water model using netCDF.  

Time series can be large data sets; large in the sense of number of recorded points, rather 

than storage space. This is often the case for unprocessed data where values may be 



OGC 09-124r2 

70  
 

recorded at very regular intervals. This has implications for the parsing and searching of 

time series as well as the way access mechanisms should be designed.  

Tools to support XML parsing and validation against developed schema will help in 

hiding some of the underlying complexity that often detracts users from XML.  

16 Creating a harmonised water observation model 

The O&M model defines the core concepts and relationships of the observation process. 

This model is generic in the sense that it does not define concepts specific to hydrological 

observations. 

In order to create a specific model for water observations, a profile may be developed of 

this model that addresses the requirements of hydrological observations. This model 

would form a core conceptual model for the exchange of water information.  

Such a specialisation of the O&M model will define types and patterns that are common 

to hydrological observations. For example, the result types within O&M are currently not 

restricted; a hydrological profile will create a time series result model that captures 

requirements such as those identified in this discussion paper (interpolation types, quality 

etc.).  

16.1 Identifying core requirements 

Existing standards will already have a certain level of semantic alignment of concepts 

between them, as shown in Figure 14, due to the nature of the domain. Close alignment of 

concepts occurs in centre of the diagram; areas outside the core may require 

harmonisation – concepts should only be considered for harmonisation if they can be 

matched to a common requirement. If they can not, they may exist in a specific 

application of the core model. Familiar concepts such as units of measure and spatial 

locations could be expected to exist across the standards.

Analysing the existing sets of standards gives us a proxy for the requirements of 

exchange formats (as they have been driven by particular needs), but an analysis of 

further requirements is important.  

Building exchange formats around such a core model provides a number of benefits: 

 Clear definition of the semantics of each concept within the model and its 
relationships. This allows agreement to be set at a high level between people, 

organisations or systems by referring to the model rather than having to resolve 

semantic differences for each concept. An example from the investigated 

standards would be reconciling the differences between variable (WaterML), 

parameter (UK-EA-TS) and phenomenon (WDTF). This benefit is paramount 

when addressing interoperability of systems.  

 Schemas, databases, documentation and code may be generated directly from the 
model. This allows easier management of versioning as a number of artefacts can 

be generated when changes occur.   

 Sharing of tools that have been developed to support the model. Code need not be 
re-written for all the standard requirements when using exchange formats such as 

ingestion, encoding, validation etc.  

 Tools such as web services may also be re-used to provide query and access 
interfaces to both people and other applications. The use of a core model here 

simplifies the adoption of such services for use in an organisation.  

 The parts of an exchange format that are specific to an organisation can be 
governed and introduced separately to the model. This helps with managing 

complexity of a format and enhances extensibility.  

Having such a core model is especially beneficial when dealing with large scale 

distribution of stakeholders and systems. This is the case with initiatives mentioned such 

as INSPIRE, AWRIS and CUAHSI. The issue with data integration in such distributed 

systems is that if each system is communicating with one another, the number of format 

translations required increases exponentially with the inclusion of new systems.  

The Canonical Data Model pattern [HOH2003] describes the use of a common 

information model that all members of the system must subscribe to in order to 

communicate with other systems. This allows translation to occur only at one point 

(where the system is introduced), rather than for each communication channel between 

distributed parties. This seems like an obvious concept when designing systems, but the 

current state of data exchange is actually multi-channel when considering channels such 

as FTP, phone, email – all often used to exchange data. For example, a common 

occurrence is for a data holder to email a CSV data file to an interested party, who 

subsequently rings up and asks about the metadata (what coordinate system is used, what 

is phenomenon ID6854 etc.) in order to correctly interpret the file.  

Developing a common model assumes that it is actually possible to correctly harmonise 

on the concepts within the domain. A separation of concerns can help here in packing 

problems into manageable parcels which capture a set of agreed upon concepts. This 



OGC 09-124r2 

72  
 

allows commitment to these definitions without pulling in a full descriptive model which 

they may not align to.  

16.2 Soft-typing vs. hard-typing 

The concept of soft-typing refers to the case where a schema does not make explicit 

structural definitions for what types should be allowed for particular classes or concepts. 

The types can essentially be defined at ‗run-time‘. The opposite of this is hard typing 

which defines up front the types and their structure that should be allowed within a 

schema.  

Adapting the explanation provided in the CSML definition [WOO2007] to a description 

of time series,  

 

An example instance: 

 
<DataRecord> 
    <element param="time">01/01/2009T09:00:00</element>  
    <element param="value">0.3</element> 
    <element param="observedProperty">RiverLevel</element> 
</DataRecord> 
 
<TimeSeries> 
    <date>01/01/2009T09:00:00</date> 
    <value>0.3</value> 
    <property>RiverLevel</property> 
</TimeSeries> 
 
<RiverLevelMeasurement> 
    <date>01/01/2009T09:00:00</date> 
    <level>0.3</level> 
</RiverLevelMeasurement 

 

Balancing between hard-typing and soft-typing in descriptions of concepts and types in a 

conceptual model is important. Soft typing allows flexibility but reduces the specificity of

the model, which creates ambiguity, reduces interoperability and affects the validation 

process of encoded documents; hard-typing tightly defines concepts making semantics 

clear and validation using existing tools easier, but reduces the ability to extend 

definitions without revising the schema.  

The general approach is that if a concept is core to the domain and can be harmonised to 

provide a common definition, then it is a candidate to be hard-typed. Concepts that are 

more specific to particular organisations or contexts should be made available through the 

use of soft-typed definitions.  

16.3 Proposed methodology 

The proposed methodology is to address the development of various aspects of a 

harmonised model in phases that relate to particular types of observations styles define in 

section 6. The initial phase will address in-situ style observational data sets (category 1 

from section 6) in the following areas: 

1. Time series structures (results); 

2. General metadata for the procedure used in measurement; 

3. Minimal metadata data for spatial features (descriptions of stations) and 
guidance on linking to external descriptions; 

4. Techniques for linking to definitions of observed phenomenon. 

The target for a proposed harmonised schema is the OGC. This implies a number of 

operating restrictions in developing a schema. Standards already defined within the OGC 

should be re-used where possible; relevant standards that should be considered include: 

 Geography Markup Language (GML) 

 Sensor Web Enablement (SWE): 

i. Observations & Measurements (O&M); 

ii. Sensor Markup Language (SensorML); 

iii. SWE Common; 

iv. Sensor Observation Service (SOS). 

The initial phase of development will refine the general approach of using UML to 

generate XML Schema . This will allow candidate schemas to be quickly developed and 

deployed for testing purposes. The development cycle will be aimed at being as agile as 

possible in its ability to respond to comment and inputs from interested parties.  

While the initial focus is on structural aspects leading to XML Schemas, it is recognised 

that including some code lists (such as interpolation types) in the standard may increase 

the usefulness of common tools.  As the XML Schemas are standardised the candidates 



OGC 09-124r2 

74  
 

for common code lists will be examined as well as tools to support the use of local code 

lists. 

The OGC has an interoperability program [OGC2009] that is a light-weight program to 

test and demonstrate the use of OGC schemas or candidate schemas. These programs 

involve deployments of services to solve real world problems, often grounded in an 

organisations particular need for data exchange. They provide a testing ground for 

schemas and feedback from such projects are extremely beneficial for the development of 

such standards. 

 

Figure 15 - Interoperability experiment interactions 

17 Data Exchange vs. Archival  

There are two diverse aspects to sharing hydrological data: sending out minimal 

information, enough to allow use; or exchanging enough for archival storage.  

There are formats that are more archival in nature, e.g. GRDC Hydrologic Datasets 

metadata profile is based on the ISO metadata standard. Presently, many datasets are 

available in text formats which enable use. They require the user to infer the details of the 

information which is often documented outside of the downloaded file.  

CUAHSI noted that presently, scientists tend to store retrieved information on disk after 

retrieval from a data source, even when the source was a method from a web service. 

Because of this observation, it was determined that a set of results must be returned with

data for disconnected use (site information, variable information, and data value 

attributes). 

XHydro provides two schema versions, one crafted for archiving and the other for data 

exchange with minimal information, allowing the correct schema to be selected for 

particular purposes.  

Sandre has defined two exchange formats to suit two different needs: a simplified one 

(equivalent to a csv) for public users or non IT specialists, and a full XML for web 

services between data warehouses.  

Future work will need to determine at which point along the spectrum a schema will exist 

or be developed. While outside the scope of the conceptual model, it will need to 

determine how ancillary information, such as rating curves and the details of a laboratory 

analysis, will be made available.  

18 Adopting a common model 

In order for users to adopt a core conceptual model there would be a process of 

‗contextualising‘ the model to satisfy an end–user‘s need. The process will be determined 

somewhat by their requirements for data exchange (file based exchange format, web 

service responses, database schemas etc.) but there are common requirements that could 

be foreseen. It would be of benefit for best practices or specifications to be developed for 

various hydrological data exchange patterns. Such work could be envisaged for the 

Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG).  

The process may include: 

1. Generating a schema from the core model that suits a deployment platform. 
Current tools allows for the generation of full GML schemas from UML models. 

This will be the initial approach for developing first round schemas from a model. 

In the future there may be need to investigate methods for generating other 

encodings, such as a simple features version of GML.  

2. Defining or importing other specific schema requirements. A user may have 
requirements that are not a part of the core model such as transactional 

information, describing ground water structures or other more explicit feature 

descriptions. It may be possible to import these from other existing standards or 

they may need to be developed as needed.  

3. Linking a schema to vocabulary definitions. Some core vocabularies (such as 
observed properties, units of measure etc.) for the hydrology domain may be 

established through community groups such as the HDWG. These could be used 

directly if they have sufficient coverage. Others that are more context-dependent 

can be developed or adapted to link to the schema.  

4. Generating documentation. It would be possible to generate or re-use 
documentation of concepts and examples for the core parts of the model. 

Examples and context specific usage could be development on top of this.  



OGC 09-124r2 

76  
 

5. Customising a validation framework. A core model may contain conformance 
criteria that allows for validation of instances against the generated schema. These 

may use normal schema validation approaches plus extra domain specific rule 

checking, such as observed phenomenon types against interpolation types (e.g. 

rainfall may only be encoded as total data types). Extra validation rules may be 

developed in addition to these to suit the particular target usage. 

6. Adapting tools. Tools to encode and decode the target schema may have been 
developed. These would need to be integrated into existing systems to allow 

mapping from existing schemas to the developed schema. 

 

19 Conclusion 

This discussion paper has investigated aspects of creating a harmonised model for 

hydrological observations, with further focus on capturing the results of observations. 

The key aspects of hydrological time series were explored by analysing a set of existing 

standards for hydrological observational data. A large number of concepts that exist 

across existing standards are compatible; suggesting a harmonised model of observational 

data could be captured.  

The premise for a harmonised conceptual model is that it will allow application specific 

profiles to be developed or extended (if required) to suite particular needs. In addition to 

this, service models may be used or built that allow for access to the information model 

(or aspects of it), such as WaterOneFlow and the Sensor Observation Service.  

There are many concepts that will require further harmonisation, and input into this 

process should come from current stakeholders. This discussion paper has focused on 

time series, with the aim to initiate further discussions on critical concepts.  

Using a model-driven approach, it will be possible to generate encodings directly from 

the harmonised model. Tools already exist to produce GML compliant encodings using 

XML Schema and it would be possible to create different encodings to suite particular 

needs within the community.  

The development of such a model would provide benefits to a large number of 

organisations looking to manage water information by providing a common platform for 

definitions of concepts and relationships.
