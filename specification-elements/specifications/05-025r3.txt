i. Preface


The OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification (OGC 04-021r3) establishes a general framework for implementing catalogue services that can be applied to meet the needs of stakeholders in a wide variety of domains. This application profile is based on the HTTP protocol binding described in Clause 10 of the Catalogue 2.0 specification; it qualifies as a ‘Class 2’ profile under the terms of ISO 19106 since it includes extensions permitted within the context of the base specifications, some of which are not part of the ISO 19100 series of geomatics standards.

v. Changes to the OGC Abstract Specification


The OGC™ Abstract Specification does not require any changes to accommodate the technical content of this document.

Foreword


This revision cancels and replaces OGC document 05-025. It depends primarily on the following base standards and specifications:


· OGC Catalogue Services Specification 2.0, with Technical Corrigendum 1 (OGC 04-021r3)


· OWS Common Implementation Specification 1.0 (OGC 05-008)


· Filter Encoding Implementation Specification 1.1 (OGC 04-095)


· OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model v3.0


· IETF RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1)

This document includes four annexes. Annexes A and B are normative; all others are informative.


Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The OGC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.


Introduction


The target audience for this document includes client and service developers, system testers, and users who want to acquire a deeper understanding of catalogue services. The specification encompasses three interrelated views that reflect different viewpoints on a catalogue service. Each viewpoint
  focuses on different areas of concern:


· Enterprise – describes the general capabilities of the service in light of functional and non-functional requirements (for catalogue users and system testers);


· Information – defines the kinds of information handled by the catalogue and the policies to be enforced (for catalogue users, developers, and testers);


· Computational – specifies the public interfaces, allowable interactions, and protocol bindings (for developers and testers).


This document defines an application profile of an OGC Catalogue service; it is primarily based on the HTTP binding (the CSW part) described in Clause 11 of the OGC Catalogue Services Specification, version 2.0 (OGC 04-021r3). The profile constrains the usage of several base specifications and introduces some additional search, retrieval, and transaction capabilities.


The terms ‘catalogue’ and ‘registry’ are often used interchangeably, but the following distinction is made in this application profile: a registry is a specialized catalogue that exemplifies a formal registration process such as those described in ISO 19135 or ISO 11179-6. A registry is typically maintained by an authorized registration authority who assumes responsibility for complying with a set of policies and procedures for accessing and managing registry content. This profile does not stipulate any particular registration policies that must be enforced by a conforming implementation.


OGC™ Catalogue Services — ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CSW

1 Scope


A catalogue implementation that conforms to this profile can serve many purposes in a variety of application domains; it provides facilities for discovering and advertising a wide variety of information resources. While such resources are often labelled as “metadata”, it is rarely possible to maintain an absolute distinction—what is deemed data in one context may be considered metadata in another. The catalogue information model is a general and flexible one that can be employed to handle many kinds of information resources—artifacts—including but not limited to: service offers, interface definitions, dataset descriptions, application schemas, and classification schemes. The service may be used to catalogue resources located in both local and remote repositories. Representations of these resources are exchanged using the standard HTTP/1.1 protocol.

2 Conformance


Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified by the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A (normative). The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in ISO 19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing.


In addition to satisfying the requirements stipulated in all normative clauses and Annex A, a catalogue implemen​tation must also satisfy all relevant requirements in the following base specifica​tions:


· OGC Catalogue Services 2.0, Clause 10 (OGC 04-021r3, with Corr. 1)


· OGC Web Services Common Specification 1.0 (OGC 05-008)


· OGC Filter Encoding Implementation Specification 1.1 (OGC 04-095)


· OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model, Version 3.0

6 Overview


6.1 Essential capabilities

A service-oriented architecture must support some fundamental interactions: publishing resource descriptions so that they are accessible to prospective users (publish); discover​ing resources of interest according to some set of search criteria (discover); and then inter​acting with the resource provider to access the desired resources (bind). Within such an architecture a catalogue service plays the essential role of matchmaker by providing publication and search functionality, thereby enabling a requester to dynamically dis​cover and communicate with a suitable resource provider without requiring the Requester to have advance knowledge about the Provider (Figure 1).



Figure 1 — Essential interactions in a service-oriented architecture

The essential purpose of a catalogue service is to enable a user to locate, access, and make use of resources in an open, distributed system by providing facilities for retrieving, storing, and managing many kinds of resource descriptions. The metadata repository managed by the catalogue can store a welter of resource descriptions that conform to any standard Internet media type, such as: XML schemas, thumbnail representations of re​motely sensed images, audio annotations, specification documents, a simple map of a meteorological sensor network, and style sheets for generating detailed topographic maps. Furthermore, arbitrary relationships among catalogued items can be expressed by creating links between any two resource descriptions. For example, a service offer may be associated with descriptions of the data sets that can be acquired using the service.


6.2 ebXML registry information model (ebRIM)


The information model is based on the OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM), version 3.0. This logical model specifies how catalogue content is structured and interrelated; it constitutes a public schema for discovery and publication purposes. The UML representation shown in Figure 2 is intended to provide a condensed, informative overview of the information model—it is not normative. The OASIS standard defines a normative XML Schema for representing registry objects.


The information model is a general and flexible one with several extensibility points. A cohesive set of extensions that address the needs of a particular application domain or community of practice are declared as parts of an extension package. An extension package is a RegistryPackage that has some membership restrictions (Subclause 6.4 ).

An instance of rim:RegistryObject (or one of its subtypes) may be included in a CSW message in any context where a record representation is allowed; for example, as a child of the csw:SearchResults element in a GetRecordsResponse message. The ebRIM representa​tions are provided if the value of the outputSchema attribute specified in the GetRecords request matches the namespace of the ebRIM schema. The ebRIM registry object representation must be used in all insert and update statements appearing within a csw:Transaction request.

Figure 2 — High-level view of ebRIM 3.0 (attributes suppressed)

6.3 Repository items


The ebRIM defines an ExtrinsicObject type as a sort of proxy for an internally (or externally) managed repository item that conforms to some well-known content type, as indicated by the value of the rim:ExtrinsicObject/@mimeType attribute; this value must correspond to a registered MIME media type. The service capabilities document lists supported content types as values of the “mime-types” service property (see Subclause 8.1.4).

6.4 Extension packages

This application profile is intended to provide a flexible, general-purpose catalogue service that can be adapted to meet the needs of diverse communities of practice within the geospatial domain. The principal means of customizing the behaviour and content of a catalogue service is by defining an extension package to exploit the extensibility points offered by ebRIM that enable it to be tailored for specific purposes; these extensibility points include:


· additional object types as specified by the value for the ExtrinsicObject.objectType attribute;


· new kinds of associations that link registry objects, as specified by the value of the Association.associationType attribute;


· additional classification schemes—or classification nodes that augment an existing scheme—for classifying registry content;


· stored queries that reflect common search patterns;


· additional slots to further characterize particular types of registry objects.


The Basic extension package is defined as part of this application profile—all implementations must support it (see Annex B). Additional packages may be defined by other parties as needed; these employ elements of ebRIM and the Basic package as suggested in Figure 3.

For example, a ‘Mapping’ package might include elements for working with the style descriptors and symbol collections used in map production. A ‘Geodesy’ package can include elements for defining coordinate reference systems and related components such as a datum and a prime meridian.





Figure 3 — Extension packages

An extension package is represented as a rim:RegistryPackage instance. Package members are registry objects that are subject to the following constraint: a member object may only be deleted if the package as a whole is deleted—this effectively treats an extension package as a composition.

6.5 Interfaces


6.5.1 OGCWebService


The OGCWebService interface is common to all OGC web service implementations. It provides the following operations:

a) GetCapabilities (required) – allows a client to retrieve service metadata that describe the computational and non-computational characteristics of the service.

6.5.2 Discovery


The Discovery interface provides the following operations:


a) GetRecords (required) – the principal operation used to search catalogue content and retrieve all or some members of the result set. 

b) DescribeRecord (required) – allows a client to discover the information model(s) supported by the catalogue and to retrieve type definitions.

c) GetRecordbyId (required) – a simple means of retrieving one or more registry objects by identifier.

d) GetDomain (optional) – produces a description of the value domain of a given data element or request parameter, where the value domain may be enumerated or non-enumerated.

e) GetRepositoryItem (required) – requests the repository item for some extrinsic object.

6.5.3 Publication 


The Publication interface provides the following operations:


f) Harvest (required) – enables a ‘pull’ style of publication whereby a resource is retrieved from some remote location (URL) and inserted into the catalogue.

g) Transaction (optional) – Allows a client to directly insert, update, or delete catalogue content.

Figure 4 is a UML diagram summarizing the service interfaces. Those operations that are not required to be implemented are shown as abstract operations. Each operation is described in more detail in subsequent clauses.



Figure 4 — Service interfaces (CSW-ebRIM)

6.6 Application schemas


This profile defines several normative XML Schemas, all of which reside in the “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs” namespace. The schemas are listed in Table 2; they are assigned the following resource identifiers:


•
http://schemas.opengis.net/csw-ebrim/1.0.0/pkg-basic.xsd


•
http://schemas.opengis.net/csw-ebrim/1.0.0/wrs-discovery.xsd


•
http://schemas.opengis.net/csw-ebrim/1.0.0/wrs-capabilities.xsd


•
http://schemas.opengis.net/csw-ebrim/1.0.0/wrs-publication.xsd

Table 2 — The CSW-ebRIM schemas


		Schema name

		Description



		pkg-basic.xsd

		Defines schema components for the Basic extension package.



		wrs-discovery.xsd

		Defines message elements for specialized search and retrieval operations.



		wrs-capabilities.xsd

		Defines additional elements used to describe profile-specific service capabilities.



		wrs-publication.xsd

		A simple composite schema for message elements pertaining to publication interactions.





The schemas are available online in the main OGC schema repository at this URL: <http://schemas.opengis.net/csw-ebrim/1.0.0/>. They are also distributed with this document as a companion Zip archive. In the event of a discrepancy between the bundled and online versions of the schemas, the online files shall be considered authoritative.


Figure 5 is a UML package diagram illustrating the main schema dependencies (the common OWS schemas are omitted for clarity). The namespace prefixes map to namespaces as indicated in Table 1. Dependency relationships that cross namespace boundaries represent an import relationship; within a namespace they depict an include relationship.

7 General capabilities

7.1 HTTP method bindings

The HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC 2616] defines eight methods for manipulating and retrieving representations of resources. Only the GET and POST methods are used in this application profile. All of the service operations defined in this application profile must be bound to HTTP methods as indicated in Table 3. Optional method bindings are indicated in parentheses. The encodings of the message payloads for all CSW requests are specified in Clause 10 of the OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification [OGC 04-021r3], as defined by the v2.0.1 schema set.

Table 3 — HTTP method bindings


		Operation namea

		HTTP method bindingsb



		GetCapabilities

		GET (POST)



		GetRecords

		POST (GET)



		GetRecordById

		GET (POST)



		DescribeRecord

		POST (GET)



		GetDomain

		POST (GET)



		GetRepositoryItem

		GET



		Transaction

		POST



		Harvest

		POST



		a
Abstract operations are shown in italics. If not implemented, the response must indicate a status code of 501 (Not Implemented); the message body may also include an ows:ExceptionReport element.

b
Optional method bindings are enclosed in parentheses ().





All bindings must be consistent with HTTP/1.1 semantics. For example, the GET method is used to retrieve whatever information—in the form of an entity—is identified by the Request-URI; it is deemed to be a “safe” method that does not give rise to any side effects such as modifying catalogue content.

7.2 Use of common message header fields

The HTTP specification defines a variety of message header fields that may be used to express client preferences or to supply metadata about the message body. Proper use of the Content-Type header is required by this profile; use of the other header fields appearing in Table 4 is strongly recommended. If any of these headers are included in a request message, they should be honored.

Table 4 — Common HTTP message headers


		Header name

		Purpose



		Accept

		Specifies acceptable MIME media types for the responsea.



		Accept-Charset

		May be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the responseb



		Accept-Encoding

		Indicates acceptable content codings for the response (e.g. gzip)



		Accept-Language

		Expresses a preferred natural language for the response



		Content-Encoding

		Identifies an encoding that has modified the media type of the entity-body (e.g. gzip).



		Content-Type

		Indicates the MIME media type of the enclosed entity-body



		Last-Modified

		Indicates the date and time at which the enclosed resource was last modified



		a
See the IANA media type registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/>.

b
See the IANA character set registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>.





7.3 Exception reports

Various faults or error conditions may arise while processing a request message. Several of these are predefined in this profile; they are included within a general service exception report that has <ows:ExceptionReport> as the document element. The report may include one or more <ows:Exception> elements that describe some error condition. The exception codes are qualified names where the prefix must be mapped to the “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs” namespace. The exception codes and the corresponding fault conditions are listed in Table 5. A generic exception code may be supplied if a more specific code does not apply.


Table 5 — Exception codes


		Exception code

		Fault condition



		wrs:Sender

		Intended for cases in which the message sender seems to have erred in some manner (this corresponds to an HTTP status code of 4xx).



		wrs:Receiver

		Intended for cases in which an unexpected condition prevented the service from fulfilling the request  (this corresponds to an HTTP status code of 5xx).



		wrs:InvalidRequest

		The request message is either invalid or is not well-formed.



		wrs:TransactionFailed

		The requested transaction could not be completed.



		wrs:NotImplemented

		The (abstract) operation has not been implemented.



		wrs:NotFound

		The requested resource does not exist or could not be found.



		wrs:NotSupported

		A service option, feature, or capability is not supported.





Every operation may produce exceptions containing the wrs:InvalidRequest code if the request message is invalid in any way. If the Request-URI contains any unrecognized query parameters, these shall be ignored—an exception must not be generated.

7.4 Predefined property sets

The OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification distinguishes three abstract property sets—predefined views—that provide differing levels of detail about a catalogue item: brief, summary, and full. These abstract views are mapped to ebRIM registry objects as indicated in Table 6. The brief view represents a “minimal” registry object that is valid against the standard ebRIM schema. Note that the brief and summary views will generate <rim:RegistryObject> instances for any object type.

Table 6 — Registry object views

rim:RegistryObject/rim:Name (in preferred languages) a

rim:RegistryObject/rim:Description (in preferred languages) a



		Full

		Complete Information Set



		a
As specified by the value of the the Accept-Language request header field.





7.5 Spatial references

Geospatial information resources often include spatial references of interest to users; such references encompass location identifiers such as place names or country subdivisions as well as geographic coordinates. Both kinds may be used to characterize registry objects using slots, where the slotType attribute specifies the type of reference provided.

The Basic extension package includes three slots that may be used to describe the spatial characteristics of a registry object. These derive from DCMI metadata terms and ISO 19136 (GML). The slot name is an absolute URI as indicated in Table 7. Simple slot values are contained as child elements of the standard rim:ValueList element. Complex values must have wrs:ValueList as the parent element, as this type defines a more flexible content model; whenever the wrs:ValueList element appears, the slotType attribute must also be present.

Table 7 — Spatial slots

		Slot name

		Slot type



		http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage

		Provides a URI reference to an internal or external geocoding scheme (e.g. a thesaurus or classification scheme), or absent if using an uncontrolled vocabulary.



		http://purl.org/dc/terms/spatial

		A qualified type name (QName) that identifies a GML geometry typea



		http://www.opengis.net/gml/Envelope

		gml:EnvelopeType



		a
The following 7 basic geometry types are sufficient for most catalogue applications: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, MultiGeometry.





Every geometry value must be associated with a coordinate reference system. No default reference system is identified in this profile, although the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) is widely used. Supported coordinate reference systems must be identified using the URN syntax documented in [OGC 05-010], and listed in the service capabilities document as values of the “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs/properties/spatial-ref-systems” property (see Subclause 8.1.4). If multiple geometry values are included for a given slot, they must represent the same geometry instance in different coordinate reference systems.

EXAMPLE 1 
A Coverage slot providing country names from ISO 3166-1

<rim:Slot name=“http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage”


  slotType=“urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim:ClassificationScheme:ISO-3166-1:Countries”>


  <rim:ValueList>


    <rim:Value>Canada (CA)</rim:Value>


    <rim:Value>United States (US)</rim:Value>


  </rim:ValueList>


</rim:Slot>


EXAMPLE 2 
An Envelope slot indicating approximate spatial extent (WGS 84 coordinates, 2D)


<rim:Slot name=“http://www.opengis.net/gml/Envelope”


  slotType=“gml:EnvelopeType”>


  <wrs:ValueList>


    <wrs:AnyValue>


      <gml:Envelope srsName=“urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.7:4326”


                    srsDimension=“2”>


        <gml:lowerCorner>48.718 -124.07</gml:lowerCorner>


        <gml:upperCorner>49.833 -122.21</gml:upperCorner>


      </gml:Envelope>


    </wrs:AnyValue>


  </wrs:ValueList>


</rim:Slot>


7.6 Mapping registry objects to CSW records


Clause 10 of the OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification defines a simple record format that is common to all CSW-based catalogue services. A csw:Record instance is an XML document that contains a collection of Dublin Core metadata terms. The simple record types corresponding to “brief”, “summary” and “full” views are all defined in the CSW schema, record.xsd.


Table 8 shows how selected CSW record properties are mapped to ebRIM information items. If no mapping is explicitly specified, then the property may be mapped to a Slot, where the name of the slot must match the absolute URI for the term in the DCMI specification.

Table 8 — Partial mapping of csw:Record elements to ebRIM

		CSW property name

		ebRIM information item(s)



		dc:identifiera

		rim:RegistryObject/@id 

rim:RegistryObject/rim:ExternalIdentifier/@value



		dc:type

		rim:RegistryObject/@objectType



		dc:title

		rim:RegistryObject/rim:Name



		dc:description

		rim:RegistryObject/rim:Description



		dc:subjectb

		rim:RegistryObject/rim:Slot/rim:ValueList/rim:Value



		dc:format

		rim:ExtrinsicObject/@mimeType



		ows:BoundingBoxc

		rim:RegistryObject/rim:Slot 



		a
The first identifier (in document order) is taken as the principal identifier; remaining identifiers are considered to be external identifiers.

b
This accommodates keywords from uncontrolled vocabularies; multiple values give rise to multiple properties. The corresponding slot name is  “http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/subject”. Note that formal classifications from ebRIM are not mapped.

c 
The corresponding slot name is “http://www.opengis.net/gml/Envelope”.





7.7 Multilingual property values

Multilingual descriptors are accommodated through the use of the rim:InternationalString element that is the value of the RegistryObject.name and RegistryObject.description properties. This element is composed of a collection of rim:LocalizedString child elements that contain language-specific values for these properties.


Example 
Using multilingual descriptors


<rim:ExtrinsicObject 


  id=“${some-uri}” 


  objectType=“urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim:ObjectType:Dataset” 


  xmlns:rim=“urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:xsd:rim:3.0”


  xmlns:xml=“http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace”>


  <rim:Description>


    <rim:LocalizedString xml:lang=“en”


      value=“The National Air Photo Library (NAPL) has over six 


      million aerial photographs.” />


    <rim:LocalizedString xml:lang=“fr”


      value=“Nous conservons à la Photothèque nationale de l’air 


      (PNA) plus de six millions de photographies aériennes.” />


  </rim:Description>


</rim:ExtrinsicObject>

8 OGCWebService interface


8.1 GetCapabilities


8.1.1 Summary

The mandatory GetCapabilities operation allows a client to retrieve information about the service. The body of the response message contains a service description that advertises the basic operational and non-operational capabilities of the service; the description is structured into subsections that may be retrieved individually by name.

8.1.2 GetCapabilities request


The GetCapabilities operation is described in Clause 7 of OGC 05-008 (OWS Common 1.0) and Subclause 10.5 of OGC 04-021r3 (Catalogue 2.0). Note that all parameter names in the KVP-encoded request must be treated in a case insensitive manner, and the query component of the Request-URI in the GET request must be appropriately escaped. Support for the GET method is mandatory; the POST method is optional, using either of the allowed content encodings (application/xml or application/x-www-form-urlencoded).

The value of the service parameter shall be the following service type identifier: “urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim:Service:OGC-CSW:ebRIM”. When included within a query component in the Request-URI, the “:” character (COLON) must be percent-encoded as “%3A”, since it is data in this context, not a delimiter.

The sections parameter may be used to request a subset of the complete capabilities document; the value is a comma-separated list of section names. The allowed set of section names recognized by this profile are listed in Table 9. If this parameter is absent, the complete description must be returned; unrecognized section names are ignored.

8.1.3 GetCapabilities response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “Capabilities”. 

· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs”.

The document element must be valid against the following element declaration:

http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/csw-ebrim/1.0.0/wrs-capabilities.xsd#Capabilities


All of the top-level elements (sections) must be included if the sections request parameter was absent; otherwise only the specified top-level elements are included.


Several additional service metadata elements are introduced in this profile (Table 10).

Table 10 — Additional service metadata elements


		Qualified name

		wrs:ServiceFeatures

		A list of implemented features. See Subclause 8.1.4.



		wrs:ServiceProperties

		A list of general service properties. See Subclause 8.1.4.



		wrs:WSDL-services

		A reference to a W3C WSDL service description. See Subclause 8.1.5.





8.1.4 General service features and properties


A standard set of service features and properties are used to convey service capabilities that are specific to CSW-ebrim catalogues. A feature is essentially a boolean property indicating that a specific feature is available. Service properties may be multi-valued. All feature and property names are absolute URIs. Several general ones are defined in this specification, but providers may introduce new ones based on URIs they manage.

Table 11 lists the general WRS service features. The asterisk (*) denotes the prefix “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs/features”, which is omitted from the table for con​venience. An unimplemented feature will not be listed in the capabilities document. If some request depends on a feature that is not available, then a service exception must be returned with an exception code of “wrs:NotSupported”.

Table 11 — General service features


		Feature identifier

		Description



		*/deep-search

		The service can execute searches against the content of repository items (the child mime-types property indicates which content types are searchable). See Subclause 9.1.7.



		*/audit-trail

		The service maintains an audit trail that tracks who changed what and when. See Subclause 10.2.2.5.



		*/version-control

		The service will treat instances of designated object types as versionable resources; the child object-types property indicates which types are versioned automatically. See Subclause 10.2.2.6.





Table 12 lists the general WRS service properties. The asterisk (*) denotes the prefix “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs/properties/”, which is again omitted for convenience.

		*/object-types

		List of URI values that identify object types that will be automatically versioned; these must match leaf nodes in the canonical object types classification scheme.





8.1.5 Web Services Description Language (WSDL)


The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML language for describing the computational characteristics of a web service in terms of interfaces, protocol bindings, and service endpoints. WSDL 2.0 is currently a W3C Working Draft that defines a com​ponent model in terms of an abstract XML infoset.


A WSDL description may be used to complement the metadata provided in an OGC service capabilities document. A definition of the service interfaces is included in Annex C. These definitions are currently informative, pending release of the WSDL 2.0 specification as a W3C Candidate Recommendation.

The <wrs:WSDL-services> element is a simple link element that may be used to include a reference to a WSDL description containing service and binding elements. The value of the xlink:href attribute must be a resolvable URI that produces the WSDL document when it is the target of a GET request; the xlink:role attribute must indicate the relevant version of the  WSDL specification (by namespace URI).

EXAMPLE 
Referencing a WSDL description in a capabilities document.

<wrs:WSDL-services xlink:type=“simple” 


    xlink:href=“http://www.foo.net/wxs/wsdl” 


    xlink:role=“http://www.w3.org/2005/08/wsdl”


    xlink:title=“Service endpoints and bindings (WSDL 2.0)” />


8.1.6 Exceptions

If an error condition arising while performing a GetCapabilities request, the service shall return an exception report as specified in Clause 8 of [OGC 05-008]. The allowed exception codes include those listed in Table 5 of Subclause 7.4.1 of [OGC 05-008], as well as wrs:InvalidRequest if applicable.


9 Discovery interface

9.1 GetRecords

9.1.1 Summary

The mandatory GetRecords operation is described in Subclause 10.8 of OGC 04-021r3 (Catalogue 2.0). This is the principal operation used to search catalogue content. Some or all of the registry objects in the result set that satisfy the search criteria may be “piggy​backed” in the response message. The POST method binding is mandatory, using either of the allowed content types; support for the application/xml content type is required in this case, however. The GET binding is optional.

9.1.2 GetRecords request


If the Content-Type of the request entity body is an XML content type (application/xml), then the document element must be the <csw:GetRecords> element, as defined in the following CSW schema:

http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/csw/2.0.1/CSW-discovery.xsd


A client may assign a request identifier (an absolute URI) for tracking or polling purposes, and several attributes may be specified to control retrieval behaviour. If the maxRecords attribute has the value “0” (zero) or the resultType attribute has the value “hits”, then only a summary of the result set is included in the response. If the @resultType attribute has the value “validate”, then the document element in the immediate response must be <csw:Acknowledgement> if the entity body is valid; if it is invalid, the response must include an exception report.

This profile does not currently allow for asynchronous processing. If the <csw:ResponseHandler> element is included it shall be ignored and the request will be processed in the normal synchronous fashion; the final response message will be returned directly to the user agent in the usual manner,

A csw:GetRecords element must include a query statement. The schema fragment below allows a choice between any element that can substitute for csw:AbstractQuery or any element from a namespace that is not “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”. In practice only one of the following elements may appear in this context: a csw:Query element (see Subclause 9.1.4), a rim:AdhocQuery element (see Subclause 9.1.6), or a wrs:StoredQuery element (Subclause 9.1.8).

EXAMPLE 
Including query statements in a GetRecords request.

<xsd:choice>

  <xsd:element ref="csw:AbstractQuery"/>

  <xsd:any processContents="strict" 

           namespace="##other" />

</xsd:choice>

If the <csw:DistributedSearch> element is present and the catalogue is able to perform a distributed search, then the catalogue will perform a local search and the request shall be forwarded to one or more affiliated catalogue services (see Subclause 9.1.9). Otherwise the <csw:DistributedSearch> element is ignored and only a local search is performed.

9.1.3 GetRecords response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “GetRecordsResponse”. 


· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”.


The RequestId element is included only if the client supplied a value in the original request. The search results may include a sequence of either <csw:Record> or <rim:RegistryObject> elements. In any case valid substitution elements may also be included, where these typically correspond to different views or instances of record subtypes.

The record representions must conform to the requested output schema. The value of the outputSchema attribute in the request restricts which elements may appear in the response (Table 13). If not specified, ebRIM representations are returned.

Table 13 — Allowable catalogue record representations

		outputSchema

		Record representations



		http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw

		csw:Record

csw:SummaryRecord


csw:BriefRecord



		urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:xsd:rim:3.0

		rim:RegistryObject

Any subtype of rim:RegistryObject





9.1.4 csw:Query statements


The <csw:Query> element is documented in Subclause 10.8 of OGC 04-021r3. However, in order to adapt the generic query syntax to a complex information model such as ebRIM a few additional constraints are needed. Furthermore, the declaration of binding variables—or aliases—is often required to avoid ambiguity when specifying complex queries that navigate associations by traversing multiple links between related registry objects. 


The value of the Query/@typeNames attribute is a whitespace-separated list of object types that constitute the scope of the query. Each value in the list MUST be a qualified type name (QName). One or more variables may be bound to a type name as shown in the following example, where each variable ranges over instances of a given object type. Multiple variables may be bound to a single type; these are delimited by a comma.

EXAMPLE 1
Declaring binding variables srv1, srv2

<csw:Query typeNames=“rim:Service=srv1,srv2 rim:ExtrinsicObject”>

  <!-- query specification -->

</csw:Query>

EXAMPLE 2
Declaring a binding variable for a slot

<csw:Query typeNames=“rim:Service rim:Slot=s1”>

  <ogc:Filter>


    <ogc:And>

      <ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>


        <ogc:PropertyName>rim:Service/$s1/@name</ogc:PropertyName>


        <ogc:Literal>http://purl.org/dc/terms/spatial</ogc:Literal>


      </ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>

      <!-- additional predicates -->

    </ogc:And>


  </ogc:Filter>

</csw:Query>

The “$” (DOLLAR SIGN) character may be used to dereference a binding variable in the query filter.

EXAMPLE 3

          </ogc:Literal>


        </ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>


      </ogc:And>


    </ogc:Filter>


  </csw:Constraint>


</csw:Query>

9.1.5 Spatial operators


An OGC filter expression may contain a spatial operator that specifies a query against the spatial characteristics of a registry object. The OGC filter grammar [OGC 04-095] defines a number of operators that evaluate various spatial relationships documented in ISO 19125-1; these are boolean methods that are used to test for the existence of a specified topological spatial relationship between two geometric objects. 


The CSW part of the OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification only requires support for the BBOX predicate—this is a convenience operator that is equivalent to Not Disjoint or Intersects relationship. This profile does not mandate support for any additional spatial operators,  but all supported operators must be listed in the service capabilities document within the Filter_Capabilities section. If any filter expression contains an unsupported operator the service must return an exception with code wrs:NotSuppported.


9.1.6 rim:AdhocQuery statements

The rim:AdhocQuery element defined in ebRIM 3.0 permits the use of alternative query languages such as XPath and XQuery. The child <rim:QueryExpression> element encapsulates a query expressed in a specified query language. In the context of a GetRecords request the query expression is required; if it is missing, the catalogue must raise an exception with code wrs:InvalidRequest. The query language should correspond to one supported by the service, as advertised by the query-languages service property in the capabilities document; if the query language is unsupported, the catalogue must raise an exception with code wrs:NotSupported.

9.1.7 XPath predicates

The <wrs:XPathPredicate> element encapsulates an XPath expression to be evaluated against a repository item that conforms to some XML content type, thereby enabling a kind of “deep search” facility for searching extrinsic content not otherwise visible through ebRIM. This element may appear within an <ogc:Filter> expression wherever a comparison operator is allowed. All relevant namespace bindings used in the expression must be declared on the XPath predicate.

Example
Definition of XPathPredicateType (from wrs-discovery.xsd).


<xsd:complexType name="XPathPredicateType" id="XPathPredicateType">

  <xsd:complexContent mixed="true">

    <xsd:extension base="ogc:ComparisonOpsType">

      <xsd:attribute name="typeName" type="xsd:string" 

                     use="required" />

    </xsd:extension>

  </xsd:complexContent>

</xsd:complexType>

The typeName attribute specifies the extrinsic object type to query; this may imply a set of repository items of a given kind, subject to any additional constraints specified in the query filter. For a given repository item, the result is converted to a boolean value as described in section 2.4 of the XPath 1.0 specification. Such predicates only apply to extrinsic objects for which the mimeType attribute indicates an XML media type and the isOpaque property has the value “false”. 


If the catalogue service does not support the deep-search feature for XML content types, then an exception must be returned with the code wrs:NotSupported.

9.1.8 Stored queries


9.1.8.1 Invoking stored queries


Extension packages may define various stored queries as a convenience; these are essentially parameterized, named queries. There are two mechanisms for invoking a stored query, using the GET and POST methods. The supported method bindings must be described in the stored query definition (rim:AdhocQuery/rim:Description). The response must have either csw:GetRecordsResponse or rim:RegistryObjectList (if invoked using the GET method) as the document element. A service provider may restrict who can read or execute a given stored query.

Using the POST method with a Content-Type of “application/xml”, a <wrs:StoredQuery> element  (an instance of the rim:IdentifiableType, as declared in pkg-basic.xsd) may appear in a GetRecords request instead of a <csw:Query> element. The id attribute specifies the stored query to execute; any parameters are passed in as child Slot elements. Only stored queries that produce a list of matching registry objects may be run in this context.

A KVP-style syntax may be used to invoke a stored query using the GET method (or POST method with Content-Type set to “application/x-www-form-urlencoded”). The value of the final path segment (shown as /query-name in the example below) is a query reference; the stored query is referenced by name. Additional parameters are appended as shown in the following example.

Example
General syntax for invoking a stored query using the GET method. The query name is appended to  the path component of the URL.

http://host:port/path/query-name?param1=v1&param2=v2a,v2b


If there is no matching stored query, the response message must indicate a status code of 404 (Not Found); the body may also include an exception report with code wrs:NotFound. If any required query parameters are missing, then an exception with code wrs:InvalidRequest must be returned.

9.1.8.2 Defining stored queries


A stored query is defined by a rim:AdhocQuery instance that may be managed like any other registry object. The query expression must conform to a supported query language. That is, the value of the rim:QueryExpression/@queryLanguage attribute must refer to a node in the canonical query language scheme (which may be extended as needed to accommodate additional query languages).

Formal query parameters are included as slots in the rim:AdhocQuery instance; parameter bindings in the query specification are indicated using $parameter-name expressions. Within a definition, the slotType attribute should specify the appropriate value space for actual parameters. The rim:ValueList element must be empty, unless a default value is declared.


9.1.9 Distributed search


The CSW part of the OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification does allow for distributed searching whereby queries are forwarded to affiliated catalogue services, effectively enlarging the search space. However this profile does not currently specify such a protocol; a service provider may implement a distributed search facility and advertise its availability as a provider-specific feature in the service capabilities description.


9.1.10 Temporal queries

Catalogue content will often have temporal attributes such as the date of last modifi​cation or the period over which a data set was collected. ISO 19108 distinguishes 13 temporal relationships that can be realized using boolean functions as part of a temporal constraint in a query filter. Available functions are listed in the service capabilities document as values of the “http://www.opengis.net/cat/wrs/properties/temporal-functions” property. Subclause 5.2.3.5 of ISO 19108 describes the conditions that must be satisfied by each relationship.

EXAMPLE 
A temporal constraint for finding registry objects modified since 1 Aug 2005.

<ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>


  <ogc:Literal>TRUE</ogc:Literal>


  <ogc:Function name="During">


    <ogc:PropertyName>rim:AuditableEvent/@timestamp</ogc:PropertyName>


    <ogc:Literal>


      <gml:TimePeriod>


        <gml:beginPosition>2005-08-01T00:00-08:00</gml:beginPosition>


        <gml:endPosition indeterminatePosition="now" />


      </gml:TimePeriod>


    </ogc:Literal>


  </ogc:Function>


</ogc:PropertyIsEqualTo>

The value of the top-level ogc:Literal element must be a boolean value: “TRUE” or “FALSE” (case insensitive). The name of the function must correspond to one of the values appearing in Figure 4 of ISO 19108: Before, After, Begins, Ends, During, Equals, Contains, Overlaps, Meets, OverlappedBy, MetBy, BegunBy, EndedBy. The child PropertyName element must refer to some temporal property. The literal temporal value must be a primitive GML temporal element: gml:TimeInstant or gml:TimePeriod. 

Following ISO 19108, the primary—and default—temporal reference system is the Gregorian calendar with UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). The identifier for this reference system is “urn:x-ogc:def:trs:ISO-8601”.

9.2 GetRecordById

9.2.1 Summary

The GetRecordById operation provides a simple means of retrieving one or more records by identifier; the identifier may be that of some registry object (rim:RegistryObject/@id) or an external identifier (rim:ExternalIdentifier/@value) assigned to a registry object. Support for the GET method binding is mandatory. Implementing the POST method is optional, in which case the “application/xml” content type must be understood.

9.2.2 GetRecordById request


The GetRecordById operation is described in Subclause 10.9 of OGC 04-021r3 (OGC Catalogue Services 2.0). The XML representation of the entity body, if present, must conform to the csw:GetRecordById element declaration (see CSW-discovery.xsd). All reserved characters (e.g., general delimeters) appearing in identifier values must be suitably percent-encoded in the KVP representation when using the GET method.

The value of an Id message item (using the GET or POST methods) identifies a registry object either directly or by an external identifier that corresponds to a child rim:ExternalIdentifier element.

9.2.3 GetRecordbyId response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “GetRecordByIdResponse”. 


· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”.


The child elements must be registry object representations (i.e. rim:RegistryObject or some valid substitution element) corresponding to the requested property set. If a match for an external identifier is found, then the parent registry object is included. If there are no matching records, an empty response is returned

9.2.4 Exceptions


If the request is deemed invalid for any reason (e.g. missing a required element), then the service must return an ows:ExceptionReport containing a service exception with the code wrs:InvalidRequest.


9.3 DescribeRecord

9.3.1 Summary


The DescribeRecord operation allows a client to discover the information model(s) supported by the catalogue and to retrieve record type definitions. Support for the POST method binding is mandatory using either of the allowed content types, although the “application/xml” content type must be understood in this case. The GET binding is optional.

9.3.2 DescribeRecord request


The DescribeRecord operation is described in Subclause 10.6 of OGC 04-021r3 (OGC Catalogue Services 2.0). The XML representation of the entity body, if present, must conform to the csw:DescribeRecord element declaration (see CSW-discovery.xsd). The TypeName elements, if present, identify the model elements for which type definitions are requested. The targetNamespace attribute of the csw:TypeName element must be specified; it may have the value “##any” to indicate any namespace.


The only schema language currently supported by this profile is W3C XML Schema. The corresponding value of the schemaLanguage attribute is given by the following URI: “http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema”.

The outputFormat attribute may be used to specify an alternative MIME media type for the response. In most cases this involves transforming the raw schema to a more human readable representation. Such a capability is optional.

9.3.3 DescribeRecord response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “DescribeRecordResponse”. 


· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”


If no TypeName elements were provided in the request, then all of the schemas defining the information model must be included within csw:SchemaComponent elements.  If there are no matching schema components, the document element must be empty.

The content of a csw:SchemaComponent element may be a complete schema or a fragment of one. If it is a fragment, the parentSchema attribute must reference the source schema (by identifier).

9.3.4 Exceptions


If the request is deemed invalid for any reason (e.g. missing a required element), then the service must return an ows:ExceptionReport containing a service exception with the code wrs:InvalidRequest.

9.4 GetDomain

9.4.1 Summary


The optional GetDomain operation produces a description of the value domain of a given data element or request parameter, where the value domain is the set of actual or permissible values. The value domain may be enumerated or non-enumerated. One use of this operation is to discover ‘active’ terms in a taxonomy that are currently used to classify registry objects.


The actual type of the data element is always returned, even if additional information about the value space is available. Support for the POST method binding is mandatory using either of the allowed content types, although the “application/xml” content type must be understood in this case. The GET binding is optional.

9.4.2 GetDomain request


The GetDomain operation is described in Subclause 10.7 of OGC 04-021r3 (OGC Catalogue Services 2.0). The XML representation of the entity body, if present, must conform to the csw:GetDomain element declaration (see CSW-discovery.xsd). The value of the csw:PropertyName must be an XPath location path that references some infoset item. Many of the ebRIM properties can be accessed in this manner, and those that refer to nodes in classification schemes can be usefully queried in this manner. 

As a special case, a request for a list of catalogued object types must identify only those types of registry objects that actually exist in the catalogue. That is, specifying a PropertyName value of “rim:RegistryObject/@objectType” will yield a list of object types that currently populate the catalogue, rather than a reference to the conceptual scheme that identifies all supported object types. In general, all properties that refer to canonical classification nodes should be handled in this manner.

EXAMPLE 
Request a listing of all catalogued object types.

<csw:GetDomain>


  <csw:PropertyName>

    rim:RegistryObject/@objectType

  </csw:PropertyName>


</csw:GetDomain>

9.4.3 GetDomain response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “GetDomainResponse”. 


· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”


The csw:DomainValues element must be present. In general the service is not required to report the ‘active’ subset of the value domain, especially for cases where this may be computationally expensive or is otherwise infeasible to determine. However, a qualified type name must always be returned.

9.4.4 Exceptions


If this operation has not been implemented, the body of the response must include an ows:ExceptionReport element containing a service exception with the code wrs:NotImplemented. If the request specifies an unknown information item, the response must include an exception with the code wrs:NotFound.

9.5 GetRepositoryItem


9.5.1 Summary


The GetRepositoryItem operation is used to retrieve the repository item corresponding to some extrinsic object. If available, the item is included in the body of the response; it must be an instance of a MIME media type, as indicated by the value of the Content-Type header field.

An extrinsic object may also be used to catalogue an external repository item that is managed by another party. In this case, the ExtrinsicObject must be associated (using the “RepositoryItemFor” association) with an ExternalLink that specifies an absolute URL for retrieving the item.

9.5.2 GetRepositoryItem request


The request is bound only to the GET method. All reserved characters appearing in parameter values must be suitably percent-encoded. The request parameters are listed in Table 14.

Table 14 — GetRepositoryItem request parameters

		Name

		Definition

		service

		Service type identifier (fixed value: “urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim:Service:OGC-CSW:ebRIM”)

		Mandatory

		Operation to invoke (fixed value: “GetRepositoryItem”)

		Mandatory



		id

		Absolute URI that refers to some extrinsic object. 

		Mandatory





9.5.3 GetRepositoryItem response


If the request is processed successfully and a repository item is accessible, the body of the response message shall include the repository item as a MIME entity. If any additional encodings have been applied to the resource (e.g., compression using gzip), these must be specified by the Content-Encoding header field.

In some cases the resource may reside in an external repository maintained by another party. In this case, the catalogue shall redirect the client using the standard HTTP redirection mecha​nism (i.e., status code 303, “See Other”) and set the value of the Location header field according to the value of the ExternalLink/@externalURI attribute.

9.5.4 Exceptions


If the request is deemed invalid for any reason (e.g. missing identifier), then the service must return an ows:ExceptionReport containing a service exception with the code wrs:InvalidRequest. If the supplied identifier does not match any registry object or if a repository item cannot be located, the response must include an exception with the code wrs:NotFound.

10 Publication interface


10.1 Harvest


10.1.1 Summary


The Harvest operation is described in subclause 10.12 of OGC 04-021r3 (Catalogue 2.0). It allows a user to request that the catalogue attempt to harvest a repository item from a specified network location, thereby realizing a 'pull' model for publishing registry content. If the catalogue successfully retrieves the resource and successfully processes it, then one or more corresponding registry objects are created or updated. Brief representations of all modified records are returned to the client when processing is complete.

10.1.2 Harvest request 


The request is only bound to the HTTP POST method. The XML representation of the entity body must conform to the csw:Harvest element declaration (see CSW-publication.xsd).

The csw:Source element specifies a URL from which the resource may be retrieved. The scheme component should correspond to a protocol supported by the catalogue; support for the “http” scheme is required by all conforming implementations, and “HTTP/1.1” must be listed in the capabilities document as a value of the “harvest-protocols” system property.


If specified, the csw:ResourceType element must indicate the object type of the corresponding extrinsic object. It may be possible for the catalogue to deduce this from the content of the resource (for example, a data set description that conforms to the ISO 19139 schemas). The value should correspond to a type supported by the catalogue, as identified in the objectType classification scheme.

10.1.3 Harvest response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “HarvestResponse”. 


· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”


The document element must include a csw:TransactionResponse element that contains the csw:InsertResults child element; this element must list all registry objects that were created as a result of the harvesting operation.

10.1.4 Exceptions


If the resource cannot be retrieved from the source URL, an exception with code  wrs:NotFound must be included in an ogc:ExceptionReport. If the resource format is not supported by the catalogue or the object type is not recognized, an exception with code  wrs:NotSupported must be returned.  In the event that the transaction cannot be completed for any reason, an exception with code wrs:TransactionFailed must be returned.

10.2 Transaction


10.2.1 Summary


The Transaction operation is described in Subclause 10.11 of OGC 04-021r3 (Catalogue 2.0, Corr. 1). It allows users to insert, update, or delete registry objects. A transaction request constitutes an atomic unit of work: all subsidiary commands must be successfully executed or the entire transaction fails; this ensures the integrity of catalogue content, especially when a set of interrelated registry objects are being submitted.


Typically transaction requests are subject to some kind of access control such that only authorized users may perform such actions. While ebRIM mandates the use of XACML (the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) to specify access control policies, this profile does not stipulate any particular security mechanisms. Service providers are free to define and enforce access control policies at several levels of granularity (e.g. service, registry object, repository item).

10.2.2 Transaction request


10.2.2.1 General behaviour


The transaction request is bound to the HTTP POST method. The XML representation of the entity body must conform to the csw:Transaction element declaration (see CSW-publication.xsd).

A registry object representation may be included in a transaction request wherever the xsd:any wildcard element appears in the definitions of the insert and update statements. No other elements may appear in this context, including instances of any of the common CSW record types. Trans​actions apply to elements of the core information model.

This profile does not currently allow for managing the lifecycle of registry content. No state transitions are defined, and in the absence of any kind of lifecycle management facility the status of all registry objects is fixed at “Submitted”. If a catalogue provides such a facility it must comply with the ebRIM 3.0 specification.


10.2.2.2 Insert statements

When inserting extrinsic objects along with one or more repository items, the multipart/form-data content type (RFC 2388) must be used. Multipart media types such as this one are intended for compound messages that consist of several interrelated parts; such entities comprise a ‘root’ part plus any number of other parts or ‘attachments’. The repository items are included as additional file parts, with the Content-Type headers set accordingly.


An XML document with the csw:Transaction element as the document element must be included in the part named “Transaction”. That is, the following request message headers must be set for this root part:


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Transaction"


Content-Type: application/xml

In order to relate an extrinsic object to a repository item, the value of the “name” parameter in the Content-Disposition header for the part containing the repository item must match the value of the id attribute for the extrinsic object in the body of the root part. While the id value must be a URN, an experimental namespace identifier may be used (e.g. “x-foo”) to provide a temporary reference to a message part; upon publication this value will be replaced with a UUID value generated by the catalogue. Any of the optional disposition parameters defined in RFC 2183 may also be included (e.g., filename, modification-date), but their usage is unconstrained by this profile and they may be safely ignored.


EXAMPLE 
Required message headers for a message part containing a repository item.

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="urn:x-foo:img-1"


Content-Type: image/png

Support for multipart/form-data content is required—this content type is supported by most HTTP user agents and client toolkits. The multipart/related media type (RFC 2387, commonly used in SOAP bindings) may also be employed, but it is optional. The catalogue shall advertise all supported content types in the mime-types service property.

10.2.2.3 Update statements


When specifying a partial update that modifies selected properties of one or more registry objects, the value of the RecordProperty/Name element must be an XPath location path that identifies the property to be updated. The RecordProperty/Value element is of type xsd:anyType, but when updating registry objects typically only simple values are provided; structured content may be included when updating complex slot values.


If a registry object is included in the context of an update statement, this will either replace the existing object or create a new version if it is a versioned object (see Subclause 10.2.2.6). For non-versioned registry objects a missing information item is interpreted as a request to remove it or reset it to the default value (if defined).


10.2.2.4 Delete statements


The deletion of registry objects is subject to a some basic rules regarding composite references stipulated in section 2.5.2 of the ebRIM 3.0 specification. When a given registry object is deleted, this deletion is cascaded to certain types of component registry objects: rim:ExternalIdentifier, rim:Classification, rim:ServiceBinding, and rim:SpecificationLink.

A registry object can be deleted only if there are no references to that object. That is, the object must not be referenced from any other rim:Association or rim:ExternalLink object; such links are not subject to a cascading delete.


Whenever an extrinsic object is deleted, the corresponding repository item is also deleted (if it exists). 

10.2.2.5 Maintaining an audit trail


A catalogue that implements this profile may maintain an audit trail for each registry object; this is indicated by adding the “audit-trail” feature to the capabilities document. An audit trail includes all of the events that have changed the state of the object (e.g., create, update, or delete requests); it consists of a  sequence of AuditableEvent objects, as documented in the ebRIM specification. A user may access the audit trail by submitting a GetRecords request, but typically viewing the audit trail is subject to some level of access control (e.g. only the owner of a resource may view the audit trial).

10.2.2.6 Basic versioning

A catalogue that implements this profile may provide a basic form of linear versioning for specific types of registry objects, as indicated by adding the “version-control” feature to the capabilities document; the child object-types property identifies which types are versioned automatically. Since the rim:VersionInfo element is required when marshalling a registry object (see ebRIM, sec. 2.5.1), the versionName attribute must have the value “UNVERSIONED” for all unversioned registry objects. By default, only the latest version shall be included in a result set.

When a registry object or repository item is updated, a new version is automatically created and added to the version history. The version history is the set of all versions of a particular version-controlled resource—it includes all registry objects that have the same value for the lid attribute. Each version in the set must have a unique id value, which must be a valid within some formal or experimental URN namespace [RFC 3406].

The version naming scheme and the maximum size or age of the version history is left to the discretion of the service provider. The naming scheme should have a simple lexico​graphic ordering. The rim:VersionInfo/@comment attribute may be set by the client in an update request.

10.2.2.7 Modifying slots

Inserting, updating, or deleting a slot is always an update against some registry object. If a slot of the same name already exists, the slot values are replaced. A slot is deleted by providing an empty rim:ValueList element; that is, emptying a slot effectively removes it.


When modifying slots in such a fine-grained manner, the update statement must include a rim:Identifiable element in order to identify the parent registry object; it may contain one or more slots to be added, replaced, or removed.

EXAMPLE 
Adding and removing a slot.

<csw:Update>


  <rim:Identifiable 


    id="urn:uuid:c8409773-177f-4266-bac9-fa98f73b5664">


    <rim:Slot name="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/rights"


              slotType="xsd:string">


      <rim:ValueList>


         <rim:Value>Copyright 2005 Foo, Inc.</rim:Value>


      </rim:ValueList>


    </rim:Slot>


    <rim:Slot name="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage">


      <rim:ValueList />


    </rim:Slot>


  </rim:Identifiable>


</csw:Update>

10.2.3 Transaction response


If the request is processed successfully, the body of the response message shall include an XML document where the document element has the following infoset properties: 


· a [local name] of “TransactionResponse”


· a [namespace name] of “http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw”


10.2.4 Exceptions


In the event that the transaction fails for any reason, the response message body must have ows:ExceptionReport as the document element. It shall contain an exception with code wrs:TransactionFailed.

The Basic extension package

B.1
Introduction

The Basic extension package introduces artifacts of general utility in the geomatics domain; these constitute a rather thin customization layer over ebRIM. All conforming implementa​tions must deploy this package, the members of which are summarized in the following subclauses. The assigned package identifier complies with the ‘ogc’ URN scheme: “urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim:package:Basic”.

The following canonical ebRIM classification schemes are required by this package:


· urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:classificationScheme:AssociationType

· urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:classificationScheme:EventType

· urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:classificationScheme:NodeType

· urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:classificationScheme:ObjectType

· urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:classificationScheme:QueryLanguage

· urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:classificationScheme:StatusType

B.2
Classification nodes

This package adds the extrinsic object types listed in Table B.1. These nodes extend the canonical ebRIM object type scheme. Each object type is assigned an identifier based on the ‘ogc’ URN scheme; the asterisk in the type identifier denotes the following string, which has been omitted in the table for convenience:

urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim:ObjectType


Table B.1 — Extrinsic object types included in the Basic package

B.3
Classification schemes

The following classification schemes are included in the Basic package:

· Services taxonomy (source: ISO 19119, Subclause 8.3)


· Slots (source: DCMI metadata terms
)


· Country codes (source: ISO 3166-1)


· Geographical regions (source: UN Statistics Division)


<http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm> 


· Feature codes (source: DIGEST v2.1, Part 4)


<http://www.digest.org/html/DIGEST_2-1_Part4_AnnexA.pdf> 

B.4
Stored queries

All of these stored queries have csw:GetRecordsResponse as the response document element, and thus may be invoked in a GetRecords context. A “view” parameter may be included with any query: “brief”, “summary” (default), or “full” are recognized values as defined in Subclause 7.4.

a) findServices — Returns a list of rim:Service elements. The optional “serviceType” parameter is an absolute URI value that identifies the service type of interest (a node in the the ISO 19119 services taxonomy).

b) listExtensionPackages — Returns a list of all deployed extension packages as a sequence of rim:RegistryPackage elements.

c) showStoredQueries — Returns a list of available stored query definitions as a sequence of rim:AdhocQuery elements. The optional “id” parameter is an absolute URI value that refers to a given stored query; multiple values may be included.

d) getVersionHistory — Returns the list of registry objects comprising the version history for the registry object specified by the required “id” parameter; if multiple values are provided, all but the first one is ignored.

B.5
Slots


Numerous slots are predefined as nodes in the ‘Slots’ classification scheme; refinements that specialize a given term are included as child nodes. Unless stated otherwise all slots can be applied to any registry object, or any subtype if a parent object type is identified. When a slot is added to a registry object, its name must match the name of the corresponding classification node.

The Basic package adds slots for many of the DCMI metadata terms: the core elements plus a few of the refinements; these may all be applied to any registry object. For simple values the slotType property should reference either an XML Schema datatype or a classifica​tion scheme if the values are selected from a controlled vocabulary; for complex values slotType must reference a suitable type definition. The slots are listed in Table B.3.

         profile may extend this type to describe additional capabilities.
         
      
       
             
                
                  
               
            
         
    

    
    
       
          
         This request allows a user to discover elements of the
         information model supported by the catalogue. If no TypeName 
         elements are included, then all of the schemas for the 
         information model must be returned.
      
         schemaLanguage - preferred schema language
                          (W3C XML Schema by default)
         outputFormat - preferred output format (application/xml by default)
         
      
       
          
             
                
            
             
             
         
      
   

    
       
          
         The unqualified name of the model element for which the type 
         definition is requested. The targetNamespace MUST be specified, 
         although it may have the value "##any" to indicate any namespace.
         
      
       
          
             
         
      
   

    
    
       
          
         The response contains a list of matching schema components
         in the requested schema language.
         
      
       
          
      
   
   
    
       
          
         A schema component includes a schema fragment (type
         definition) or an entire schema from some target namespace;
         the schema language is identified by URI. If the component
         is a schema fragment its parent MUST be referenced (parentSchema).
         
      
       
          
      
       
       
       
   

    
    
       
          
         The principal means of searching the catalogue. The matching 
         catalogue entries may be included with the response. The client 
         may assign a requestId (absolute URI). A distributed search is 
         performed if the DistributedSearch element is present and the 
         catalogue is a member of a federation. Profiles may allow 
         alternative query expressions.
         
      
       
          
             
                
                
                
                  
                  
               
            
             
             
             
         
      
   
   
    
       
          
            Various attributes that specify basic retrieval options:

            outputFormat   - the media type of the response message
            outputSchema   - the preferred schema for records in the result set
            startPosition  - requests a slice of the result set, starting
                             at this position
            maxRecords     - the maximum number of records to return. No
                             records are  returned if maxRecords=0.
         
      
       
       
       
       
   
   
    
     
       
         
           
          Include results in the response.
          
        
      
       
         
           
          Provide a result set summary, but no results.
          
        
      
       
         
           
          Validate the request and return an Acknowledgement message if it 
	      is valid. Continue processing the request asynchronously.
          
        
      
    
  
   
    
       
          
         Governs the behaviour of a distributed search.
         hopCount     - the maximum number of message hops before
                        the search is terminated. Each catalogue node 
                        decrements this value when the request is received, 
                        and must not forward the request if hopCount=0.
         
      
       
   
   
    
    
    

    
       
          
         Specifies a query to execute against instances of one or
         more object types. A set of ElementName elements may be included 
         to specify an adhoc view of the csw:Record instances in the result 
         set. Otherwise, use ElementSetName to specify a predefined view. 
         The Constraint element contains a query filter expressed in a 
         supported query language. A sorting criterion that specifies a 
         property to sort by may be included.

         typeNames - a list of object types to query.
         
      
       
          
             
                
                   
                   
               
                
                
            
             
         
      
   
   
    
      
        
       The exact syntax is defined in an application profile. If querying 
       against the common record properties, only a single type may be 
       specified (Record).
       
     
      
   
   
    
    
       
          
         A search constraint that adheres to one of the following syntaxes:
         Filter   - OGC filter expression
         CqlText  - OGC CQL predicate

         Named subsets of catalogue object properties; these
         views are mapped to a specific information model and
         are defined in an application profile.
         
      
       
          
          
          
      
   

    
    
       
          
         The response message for a GetRecords request. Some or all of the 
         matching records may be included as children of the SearchResults 
         element. The RequestId is only included if the client specified it.

      This schema defines the request and response messages for the 
      CSW-Publication operations specified in clause 10 of OGC-04-021.
      
   

    

    
    
       
          
         Users may insert, update, or delete catalogue entries. If the 
         verboseResponse attribute has the value "true", then one or more 
         csw:InsertResult elements must be included in the response.
         
      
       
          
             
                
                   
                   
                   
               
            
             
             
         
      
   
   
    
       
          
         Submits one or more records to the catalogue. The representation
         is defined by the application profile. The handle attribute
         may be included to specify a local identifier for the action 
         (it must be unique within the context of the transaction).
         
      
       
         
      
       
   
   
    
       
          
         Update statements may replace an entire record or only update part 
         of a record:
         1) To replace an existing record, include a new instance of the 
            record;
         2) To update selected properties of an existing record, include a 
            set of RecordProperty elements. The scope of the update statement 
            is determined by the Constraint element.
         The 'handle' is a local identifier for the action.
         
      
       
         
           
           
             
             
          
         
      
       
   
   
    
       
          
         Deletes one or more catalogue items that satisfy some set of 
         conditions.
         
      
       
          
      
       
       
   

    
       
          
         The RecordProperty element is used to specify the new
         value of a record property in an update statement.
         
      
   
    
       
          
             
                
               The Name element contains the name of a property
               to be updated.  The name may be a path expression.
               
            
         
          
             
                
               The Value element contains the replacement value for the
               named property.
               
            
         
      
   

    
    
       
          
         The response for a transaction request that was successfully
         completed. If the transaction failed for any reason, a service 
         exception report indicating a TransactionFailure is returned instead.
         
      
       
          
          
      
       
   
   
    
       
          
         Reports the total number of catalogue items modified by a transaction 
         request (i.e, inserted, updated, deleted). If the client did not 
         specify a requestId, the server may assign one (a URI value).
         
      
       
          
          
          
      
       
   
   
    
       
          
         Returns a "brief" view of the catalogue items modified
         by some transaction. The handle attribute may reference a
         particular statement in the corresponding transaction request.
         
      
       
         
      
       
   

    
    
       
          
         Requests that the catalogue attempt to harvest a resource from some 
         network location identified by the source URL.

         Source          - a URL from which the resource is retrieved
         ResourceType    - a URI that specifies the type of the resource
                           (DCMES v1.1) being harvested if it is known.
         ResourceFormat  - a media type indicating the format of the 
                           resource being harvested.  The default is 
                           "application/xml".
         ResponseHandler - a reference to some endpoint to which the 
                           response shall be forwarded when the
                           harvest operation has been completed
         HarvestInterval - an interval expressed using the ISO 8601 syntax; 
                           it specifies the interval between harvest 
                           attempts (e.g., P6M indicates an interval of 
                           six months).
         
      
       
          
             
                
                
                
                
                
            
         
      
   

    
       
         
        The content of the response varies depending on the presence of the 
        ResponseHandler element. If present, then the catalogue should 
        verify the request and respond immediately with an csw:Acknowledgement 
        element in the response. The catalogue must then attempt to harvest 
        the resource at some later time and send the response message to the 
        location specified by the value of the ResponseHandler element using 
        the indicated protocol (e.g. ftp, mailto, http).
         
        If the ResponseHandler element is absent, then the catalogue 
        must attempt to harvest the resource immediately and include a 
        TransactionResponse element in the response.
        
        In any case, if the harvest attempt is successful the response 
        shall include summary representations of the newly created 
        catalogue item(s).
        
      
   
    
      
        
        
     
   




schemas/csw/2.0.1/rec-dcmes.xsd
 

   
     
    This schema declares XML elements for the 15 Dublin Core elements in the
    "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" namespace.
    
  

   
     
       
      This is the default type for all of the DC elements. It defines a 
      complexType SimpleLiteral which permits mixed content but disallows 
      child elements by use of minOcccurs/maxOccurs. However, this complexType 
      does permit the derivation of other types which would permit child 
      elements. The scheme attribute may be used as a qualifier to reference 
      an encoding scheme that describes the value domain for a given property.
      
    
     
       
         
           
        
         
      
    
  
   
  
   
     
       
      A name given to the resource. Typically, Title will be a name by 
      which the resource is formally known.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      An entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource.
      Examples of Creator include a person, an organization, or a service. 
      Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      A topic of the content of the resource. Typically, Subject will be 
      expressed as keywords, key phrases, or classification codes that 
      describe a topic of the resource. Recommended best practice is to 
      select a value from a controlled vocabulary or formal classification 
      scheme.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      An account of the content of the resource. Examples of Description 
      include, but are not limited to, an abstract, table of contents, 
      reference to a graphical representation of content, or free-text 
      account of the content.
      
      
  
  
   
      
       
      An entity responsible for making the resource available. Examples of 
      Publisher include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, 
      the name of a Publisher should be used to indicate the entity.
      
    
  

   
      
       
      An entity responsible for making contributions to the content of 
      the resource. Examples of Contributor include a person, an organization, 
      or a service. Typically, the name of a Contributor should be used to 
      indicate the entity.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      A date of an event in the lifecycle of the resource. Typically, Date 
      will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource. 
      Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a 
      profile of ISO 8601 and includes (among others) dates of the 
      form YYYY-MM-DD.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      The nature or genre of the content of the resource. Type includes 
      terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation 
      levels for content. Recommended best practice is to select a value 
      from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the DCMI Type Vocabulary). 
      To describe the physical or digital manifestation of the resource, 
      use the Format element.
      
    
  
  
   
      
       
      The physical or digital manifestation of the resource. Typically, 
      Format will include the media-type or dimensions of the resource. 
      Format may be used to identify the software, hardware, or other 
      equipment needed to display or operate the resource. Examples of 
      dimensions include size and duration. Recommended best practice is to 
      select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the list 
      of Internet Media Types defining computer media formats).
      
    
  
  
   
      
       
      An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context. 
      Recommended best practice is to identify the resource by means of a 
      string or number conforming to a formal identification system. Formal 
      identification systems include but are not limited to the Uniform 
      Resource Identifier (URI) (including the Uniform Resource Locator 
      (URL)), the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), and the International 
      Standard Book Number (ISBN).
      
    
  
  
   
      
       
      A Reference to a resource from which the present resource is derived.
      The present resource may be derived from the Source resource in whole 
      or in part. Recommended best practice is to identify the referenced 
      resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal 
      identification system.
      
    
  
  
   
         
       
      A language of the intellectual content of the resource. Recommended 
      best practice is to use RFC 3066, which, in conjunction with ISO 639, 
      defines two- and three-letter primary language tags with optional 
      subtags. Examples include “en�? or “eng�? for English, “akk" for
      Akkadian, and “en-GB�? for English used in the United Kingdom.
      
    
  
  
   
      
       
      A reference to a related resource. Recommended best practice is to 
      identify the referenced resource by means of a string or number 
      conforming to a formal identification system.
      
    
  
  
   
     
       
      The extent or scope of the content of the resource. Typically, 
      Coverage will include spatial location (a place name or geographic 
      coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date range), 
      or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity). Recommended 
      best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary 
      (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]) and to use, 
      where appropriate, named places or time periods in preference to 
      numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.
      
    
  
  
   
      
       
      Information about rights held in and over the resource. Typically, 
      Rights will contain a rights management statement for the resource, 
      or reference a service providing such information. Rights information 
      often encompasses Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Copyright, and 
      various Property Rights. If the Rights element is absent, no 
      assumptions may be made about any rights held in or over the resource.
      
    
  

   
     
       
      This group is included as a convenience for schema authors who need

      A given named feature is included only if it is available. The name 
      value is an absolute URI as defined in the specification. Any properties 
      that configure the behaviour of a given feature are included as child 
      elements.

      A general record identifier, expressed as an absolute URI that maps to 
      the rim:RegistryObject/@id attribute. It may substitute for the ogc:_Id 
      element in an OGC filter expression.
      
    
  
   
     
       
    
  
  
   
     
       
      Encapsulates an XPath expression to be evaluated against extrinsic 
      objects with content conforming to some XML media type. This element 
      may appear within an ogc:Filter wherever a comparison operator 
      is allowed. All relevant namespace bindings needed to evaluate the 
      expression are declared on this element.
      
    
  
   
     
       
      The typeName attribute specifies the (extrinsic) object type to 
      query. Objects with non-XML content types are ignored. The result is 
      converted to a boolean value as described in the W3C XPath standard.

wsdl-2.0/csw-ebrim-1.0.0.wsdl
 

   
  W3C WSDL 2.0 interface descriptions for the CSW-ebRIM catalogue application profile.
  

   
     
     
     

     
      
       
         
        This schema declares message elements for GET requests or POST requests 
        encoded as content type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" (i.e., 
        KVP-style encoding).
        
        1. Parameter names and values are escaped. Space characters are 
           replaced by '+', and then reserved characters are percent-encoded 
           as described in RFC 3986, section 2.2.
        2. the parameter name is separated from the value by the EQUALS SIGN 
           character and name/value pairs are separated from each other 
           by the AMPERSAND character. If multiple values are allowed they 
           are separated using the COMMA character.
