Abstract

The Location Organizer Folder (LOF) is a GML document that provides a structure
for organizing the information related to a particular event or events of interest. It
may be used in various analysis applications, like disaster analysis, Intelligence
analysis, etc. It is spatially enabled, and capable of managing disparate types of
information.

The LOF is an information structure. There may be a variety of services external to
the LOF that provide the means for generation and manipulation of the information
in the structure. This includes search and discovery, parsing different resources and
extracting useful information, assigning spatial attributes, relating (linking)
resources of interest, and so on.

This document was created as a part of the OGC Geospatial Fusion Services
Testbed (GFST 2000) and Geospatial Fusion Services Pilot Project (GFSPP 2001).
Even though the LOF is meant to be a generic structure, it is not completely
independent from the services that process it, which were also built during these
projects. Thus, the document describes the structure of the LOF, and to some extent,
the system and some of the services that process the LOF. In the future, the LOF
will become a completely generic information structure, decoupled from any
specific component that can use it.

Section 1 describes the framework in which the LOF will be used. It is a description
of a system that might use the LOF. It is based on the system built during the OGC
GFST and GFSPP projects. Section 2 presents the model of the LOF. Section 3
discusses the use of links and relationships in the LOF.

Status of this document

This document is a draft candidate implementation specification. It represents
“work in progress” and should be treated accordingly.

1. LOF Framework

This section describes the function of a generic “LOF system”, the role of the LOF
and other components in the system, relationship between the LOF and other
components, and manipulations by services and applications on the LOF. The
description is based on the system built during the OGC GFST and GFSPP projects,
so it does involve some specifics, but we will concentrate on the generic aspects of
the system, i.e. functionality that any system that operates with the LOF might
implement.

1.1 Functions of a containing system

The functionality of the system that operates with the LOF is:

1. Discover and extract the information that is useful for a particular analysis that
is performed.

2. Extract useful information from free text resources like cables, text messages
etc.

3. Correlate resources organized in the LOF. This is one of the most important
functions of the system. LOF therefore must provide the means to create and
describe relations between resources.

4. Browse resources and information stored in LOF.
5. Perform analysis on the collected set of information represented in the LOF.
6. Present the information. There should be means for visual presentation of geo-

spatial features overlaid on a map, and also presentation of other types of
resources, using associated specific applications.

7. Manipulate the LOF(s): Filter the LOF, perform union or intersection of LOFs,
and copy the LOF.

8. Share and exchange LOFs among users.

For a detailed description of functionality of a system like this, refer to the GFST
Use Cases document of the Geospatial Fusion Services Testbed Project.

1.2 Containing system architecture

The example system architecture of which the LOF can be a part of is presented in
the Figure 1.



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 8/37

Figure 1. A containing system architecture

One of the main functions of a system like this is to extract the information from
various resources and to assign that information various specific attributes. In this
architecture, the Geoparser/Gazetteer/Geocoder (3G) services are examples that
perform such an operation. In general, these are network accessible components.

Geoparser parses the free text (news, messages, reports, etc.) and marks up
recognized terms and phrases of interest. Recognition is performed against preset
vocabularies, possibly specified by the user at runtime. Output of the Geoparser is
the collection of features that identifies words and phrases in the original text
resource.

Gazetteer is the service that retrieves known geometry for features that have well-
known feature identifiers, like landmarks. A feature identifier is a well-known name
or description such as that which is output from the Geoparser Service.

Geocoder is the service that performs the transformation of the location description
of a feature into a normalized location description that includes the geometry of the
feature.

3G services may be accessed by the client separately, but may also be chained, so
that the client provides the input to the chain (free text resource to the Geoparser),
and receives the feature collection with spatial (geometry) attributes as output from
the Geocoder.

Location Organizer Specification v1.03 9/37

LOF Manager is the mediator (on the LOF side) between the LOF and services and
applications that work on the information stored in the LOF. It is usually
implementation dependant. For example, its implementation depends on the type of
data store that is used for storing the LOF.

The Client handles the presentation of the Location Organizer Folder to the
operator, and allows the operator access to services for manipulating resources
associated with the LOF.

WFS (OGC Web Feature Server), WMS (OGC Web Map Server), free text
resources and other resources are, in general, Web accessible repositories and
servers that provide information that might be of interest to the LOF user (analyst of
the event of interest).



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 10/37

2. LOF Model

2.1 Object model

Location Organizer Folder is a generic information structure that can be used in a
variety of applications. It is a stateless Feature Collection defined on an Area Of
Interest (AOI). As previoulsy mentioned, there are some basic actions that will
always be performed on it, but we also might imagine others -- application specific
ones. In this sense, we define a “core”, or “basic” LOF model, and assume that it
can be extended. The general object model of the LOF is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2. General object model of the LOF

A detailed object model of the LOF, created from the LOF schema (Appendix A) in
the schema editor, is presented in Figure 3.

Spatial Feature

The Spatial Feature in the LOF is based on the GML feature, as defined in GML
2.0. It may or may not have geometry. LOF can contain any number of LOF
features. The type of the LOF feature derives from the basic GML feature type by
adding properties specific to the LOF (links, metadata and style). It is expected that
the basic LOF feature type will be further extended to facilitate any application-
specific need. Applications will probably define some concrete specific feature
types, for example, geography ones: Road, Park, etc. Actually, in the LOF schema,
as presented in this document, two concrete feature types are defined based on the
basic LOF feature type – ExtendedFeatureType and ObservationType. Extended
Feature serves as a container for exchanging the data between the LOF and 3G
services, and Observation feature is a feature specific to event analysis. For detailed
descriptions of these two types, see sections 2.2 Feature type hierarchy and
2.4 3G Services.



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 12/37

LOF feature can be local to the LOF or remote. In that sense LOF conforms to
GML 2.0 specification. It can also contain links to other features or other types of
resources, local or remote. Section 3. Geolinks in the Location Organizer Folder
describes the linking mechanisms in the LOF.

LOF is a feature collection, which is in turn, by the definition from GML, is also a
feature. Therefore, a feature in the LOF may reference another LOF.

Detailed models of the AbstractLofFeatureType, ExtendedFeatureType and
Observation type are presented in Figures 4, 5 and 6.

Lineage Link

Lineage Links element tracks the creation history of the feature. It holds the
information of the sources from which the feature is created. There are two
properties in LineageLinks: sourceFeature and baseFeature. The sourceFeature
references the feature from which the feature was created (for example by copying).
The baseFeature references the resource from which the feature was created in the
first place. This use of LineageLinks is shown in the example case in the Figure 7.

Location Organizer Specification v1.03 14/37

Feature Metadata

Feature metadata is a Property Group element that contains metadata specific to the
LOF feature. There are specific semantics for the Property Group construct. It holds
the properties that are in fact properties of the parent element (in this case a feature)
rather than itself. Specific properties of a LOF feature include:

• creator
• date of creation
• source
• security
• label.

Security is a string that describes the security level on the feature. It might be
redefined in the future to allow for a more fine grained security description.

Style Descriptor

The Style Descriptor element declares the default style for a feature or LOF. It
ensures that, while the styling and the content of the data is strongly separated, there
is a means to persist the styling for a particular feature, or for the whole LOF. The
analyst will be able to save and later use not only the data that he has added to the
LOF but also it’s presentation. Of course, the style descriptor holds only the default
style which can be overriden by user actions.

Syle descriptor contains two pieces of information about the style. defaultStyle is an
URI reference to the style that is used on this feature/LOF. styleType denotes the
type of the style referenced by the defaultStyle. Based on the value of the styleType
property, a client is able to perform proper styling. At the moment, the type of the
styleType property is string, but it might be an enumeration of known styling types
(using Extensible Stylesheet Language, Styled Layer Descriptor and so on…)

Information Element

Information elements are typically non-spatial entities including voice records,
cables, e-mail messages, and the like. However, they may be any network resources
that are referenced from geo-spatial features in the LOF. As mentioned earlier, this
is the primary function of the client, or the containing system in general - to create
and maintain relationships in the LOF, including relationships between feature
elements and Information Elements. The process of “geo-referencing an



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 15/37

Information Element” relates the Information Element to a geo-spatial feature. In
many cases, this will require that a geo-spatial feature be created. In fact the only
way to associate an Information Element with a geo-spatial feature, and hence to
provide it with a location, is to make the Information Element the value of a
property of a geo-spatial feature.

Information elements may also contain links to resources local to LOF, or remote
ones.

A GeoText message is a “cable” or some other form of text resource. It is “free-
text” message, which means that no constraints are put on it. It may also be marked-
up text. GeoText message is one of the main sources from which information of
interest is extracted and stored in the LOF. 3G services perform the operations of
extracting, geocoding (assigning spatial attributes) and creating LOF features. LOF
features created in this way contain links back to the words and phrases in the
GeoText message from which they were created. For a detailed description of
GeoText message parsing, refer to the 2.4 3G Services section.

VoiceRecord, SignalRecord and Image are “multimedia” objects. A VoiceRecord is
an object that contains the digitized record of a conversation or conversations. A
SignalRecord is an object that contains the digitized record of an electronic signal
associated with some form of communication. An Image is an object that contains
the digitized record of a visual image as might be acquired by a frame or scanning
camera from a terrestrial, space borne or aerial platform. They all may or may not
be geo-referenced. If they are geo-referenced, it is assumed they are related to
some existing geo-spatial feature. As such, these information element objects may
be defined as the values of properties of geo-spatial features.

Figure 8 presents a model of the informationElementPropertyType whose value can
be one of mentioned InformationElement types.



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 16/37

Figure 8. Information Element Types

Causal Narrative

LOF optionally contains a causal narrative. A causal narrative is human readable
text-based explanation of the incident described by the LOF. This is created by the
analyst in the course of assembling the LOF and is the analyst’s integration or
fusion of the events and activities that the LOF references.

The Causal Narrative is composed of segments, each of them representing one
CausalNarrative element in the LOF. Each segment has an identified author or
authors. Segments can be replaced or updated. There is no requirement to maintain
an audit trail of changes to these segments, in this release.

The Causal Narrative can incorporate XLinks (simple, bare name Xpointers) from
arbitrary text fragments to other elements of the LOF, namely to geo-spatial
features or information elements. Links from the Causal Narrative cannot point
outside of the LOF.

The function of the Causal Narrative element is shown in the Figure 9.



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 17/37

Figure 9. Causal Narrative

Metadata Group

This group holds the metadata that describes the LOF. Rather than using Property
Group element like in the case of feature metadata, LOF metadata group is XML
Schema group, which means that every property element group is a direct child of
the LOF. The group contains the following metadata properties:

• creator, organization, creationDate – the creator of the LOF, the
organization that owns the LOF and the date of LOF creation.

• security – security level for the LOF. It is at the moment a string, but it
might be defined to be more complex in the future to allow for richer
description of LOF security.

• ProblemSetType - identifies the type of problem set. The type is an internal
name or code established by the user organization.

• referenceVocabulary - the reference to the Reference Vocabulary for the
LOF. This vocabulary defines the key terms and concepts that pertain to the
problem set (these are pre-built and exist in the vocabulary “pool” available
to all users).

• lofVocabulary - the reference to the LOF Vocabulary. Initially, this defaults
to the Reference Vocabulary, but has additional terms/concepts that get
added through the course of LOF manipulation activities.

• latestRevisionDate and latestAccessDate – latest update/access dates.

Area Of Interest and Backgroud Map

LOF has number of Area of Interest elements. Area of Interest (AOI) defines the
spatial extent of a region of the Earth’s surface. It defines a real world area that is of
interest for a particular analysis, and to which resources in the LOF are related.
There is only one primary AOI. There may be a number of sub-AOIs. They are
organized in a hierarchical structure.

The model for the AOI-Background Map hierarchy is shown in the Figure 10.

Figure 10. Area of Interest and Background Map Hierarchy

Every AOI has an associated Background Map element that covers the extent
defined by the AOI. Actually, the spatial extent of the AOI might be different from
the spatial extent of it’s associated background map, since it might happen that an
analyst wants to use the map that covers only a part of the AOI’s extent. Typically
the background map is an image map (GIF, PNG etc.), but this is not a requirement.
It is anticipated that the background map will be obtained using a WMS interface
from an OGC Web Map Server, although this is not a requirement.

Areas of Interest can be visualized as polygon elements overlaid on the surface of
the background map, at the same hierarchy level. Users will typically create an area

of interest by loading a background map and drawing or otherwise defining the area
of interest. The Primary AOI may be defined relative to a map of the earth.

2.2 Feature type hierarchy

As mentioned earlier, LOF feature is based on the GML feature as defined in the
GML 2.0. Base LOF feature type is defined as abstract. It is extended in the client
application according to user requirements.

The hierarchy of the feature type definition in the LOF is presented in Figure 11.

Figure 11. Feature Type Hierarchy

We have identified three schema layers. Basic layer is the GML layer which defines
basic types that will be used to define application schemas (feature, geometry, etc.).

Location Organizer Specification v1.03 20/37

So from the GML point of view, both base LOF layer and application LOF layer are
applications of GML. However, we use the same principle in defining the LOF.
There are some basic types that will be used in all LOF applications and we
therefore define the base LOF layer (schema). Anything that is application specific
is an application of the base LOF.

We have already described the base LOF feature, i.e. AbstractLofFeatureType and
it’s properties. It is further extended at the level of the base LOF schema to create
two concrete feature types.

The ExtendedFeatureType defines the feature that is used in the processing of the
information by the 3G services. The processing starts with a text message from
which well-known terms and phrases are extracted, and features with spatial
attributes are created. Those features contain links back to original words and
phrases in the GeoText message. Instances of the ExtendedFeatureType are used to
store intermediate results of the processing of the Geoparsing/Geocoding service
chain, including:

• links back to the text source
• a list of vocabularies used
• references to one or more recognized terms (e.g., London in the UK, and

London in Canada)
• references to terms found in source text documents
• geometry associated with terms

For more detailed description of ExtendedFeatureType and processing performed
by the 3G services, see section 2.4 3G Services.

The ObservationType is a concrete feature type that represents an observation of a
person, place, organization, equipment or event. It extends the definition of the base
LOF feature (AbstractLofFeatureType) as described below:

• obsCode is the property that defines the type of the observation. It is an
enumerated type of the following values: Person, Organization, Event,
Equipment and Location.

• startTime and endTime define the duration of the observation.
• narrative property is a human readable description of the observation.
• gml:location is spatial (geometry) property of the observation, i.e. the

location where the observation took place.
• relatedThing is a Remote Property (Simple Xlink) type property. It points to

any resource, local or remote that is related to the observation. Any given
ObservationType instance may have zero or more relatedThing properties.



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 21/37

2.3 Union and intersection of LOFs

A LOF is a spatially enabled information structure, and it is also a collection of
features. Spatial extent of a LOF is defined by it’s primary AOI. So let’s first define
union and intersection of two AOIs.

AOI is defined as a Box geometry (square shape). It can have any number of
children AOIs. The union of two AOIs is a Box (spatial extent) of which both of
AOIs are a part and which contains all of the children of the two AOIs. The union
of two AOIs is shown in Figure 12.

Figure 12. Union of two AOIs

Intersection of two AOIs is defined as the spatial extent that is part of both AOIs,
and contains all of children AOIs that are not completely out of it’s boundaries. It is

shown in the Figure 13.

Figure 13. Intersection of two AOIs

Having defined the union and intersection of AOIs, we can now define the
union/intersection of two LOFs.

Location Organizer Specification v1.03 22/37

Th union of two LOFs is the union of their primary AOIs, and contains all the
features and information elements from both LOFs.

The intersection of two LOFs is the intersection of their primary AOIs and contains
all features and information elements that are not completely out of it’s boundaries.
If a feature is not spatially enabled, it belongs to the new LOF.

Issue Name: [Temporal Union and Intersection. (HAN, 3/28/01)]
Issue Description: [Likewise, there remains the question of what happens in temporal space,
as a result of union or intersection operations.]
Resolution: [Open. (name , date)]

2.4 3G Services

The 3G Services are Geoparser, Geocoder and Gazetteer. When chained together,
they can be used to process free-text resources to create geo-spatial features.

The input to the Geoparser is a free-text resource, such as a “cable” or other type of
message stored in a GeoText message. The Geoparser outputs the collection of
recognized words and phrases with the information about the recognition process.
This includes the vocabularies used, the estimated quality of the recognition and
links back to the input text source.

The output of the Geoparser may serve as input to a Geocoder or Gazetteer service.
The Geocoder and Gazetteer services update ExtendedFeatureType instances with
spatial attributes. ExtendedFeatureType is a concrete feature type that is used as a
container for the result of this processing. Having the ExtendedFeatureType
instance, it is easy to insert the result of the 3G processing into a LOF without any
modifications or mapping between the feature that is created by the 3G services and
the LOF feature.

Also, there is important metadata about the processing that took place that is stored
with the ExtendedFeatureType instance as described below:

• qualityMetric – describes the quality of the performed service. Recognizes
that a term in free-text is rarely guaranteed to be 100% accurate. Therefore,
the service provides it’s estimate of how accurate the recognition was.

• vocabularies – the recognition is performed against some vocabulary. The
term might appear in different vocabularies, for example, the term “London”
might appear in both “UK Place Names” and “Canadian Place Names”



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 23/37

vocabularies. It also might have different meanings in different
vocabularies, for example Washington might be the place name as well as a
person’s name. Therefore with every recognized term, there is the reference
to the used vocabulary.

• termName - The word or phrase that is marked recognized.
• occurrences – This is the list of occurrences in the source text. Every

occurrence element consists of the pointer (Simple Xlink) to the original
text document, and two non-negative integers representing ordinals of the
first and last characters of the term in the source document.

• role – describes the meaning of the found term.
• gml:_geometryProperty – geometry property associated with the feature by

the gazetteer/geocoder.



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 24/37

3. Geolinks in the Location Organizer Folder

Geolinks are the means for referencing resources, local or remote, from resources in
the LOF (or GML in general). Geolinks are based on the Xlinks specification, as
defined in GML 2.0. For the purpose of GML, the Geolinks specification only
groups Xlink attributes to allow for using two basic geolink entities: remote
properties (Xlink Simple Link) and relationships (Xlink Extended Link). The
Geolinks specification is at the moment not completely part of the GML. However,
GML does declare Xlink attributes necessary for forming Geolink constructs. But
the definition of the remote properties or relationships is not the part of GML, and it
needs to be included in an application schema, such as the LOF schema.

3.1 Remote properties

Remote properties are Xlink Simple Link constructs. They allow for uni-directional
linking, with the containing resource representing the start of the link, and the target
resource representing the end of the link. In the LOF, RemotePropertyType is
defined and used for definition of remote property elements. The following
properties are defined as Remote Properties in the LOF:

• lofMember property. It is based on lofMember property from GML and it
inherits the RemoteProperty behavior. It is used to reference features that
are stored remotely, outside the LOF document. It might also be used to
reference other LOFs, since LOF is also a feature.

• relatedThing property. It is a member of ObservationType and
InformationElementType. It can be used to reference any resource that is
related to a particular feature or information element instance.

• sourceFeature and baseFeature properties.
• remoteContent property of the InformationElement.
• backgroundMap property.

3.2 Relationships (extended Xlinks) in LOF

Relationships are not the part of the LOF schema at this time. Only simple links
(remote properties) are used. However, there is the need to define links that are
more complex than a remote property. The main purpose of the LOF and systems
that use it is that it provides a means for forming and exploiting related collections
of geo-connected resources, as applications warrant. Analysts are interested in the
semantics (meaning, value) of the resources in a LOF, and that semantics is built by



Location Organizer Specification v1.03 25/37

defining LOF feature/information element relationships with other
feature/information elements, and with other Web resources.

Remote properties are simple properties that have a URI reference to a remote
resource and some metadata in the form of its attributes that describe the role of the
property.

Relationships are objects (in contrast to properties) that have their own properties
and provide rich descriptions of a relationship. A relationship allows for linking
more than two resources, bi-directional traversing, the complete separation of
resources and the relationship amongst them, and so on.

The object model of the Relationship object is shown in the Figure 14.

Figure 14. Relationship Object Model

Relationship is a full-fledged object that represents the whole relationship. It has
three types properties – Local Resource, Remote Resource and the Arc. It can
contain any number of those properties.

Local Resource is a property that contains a local resource. The meaning of the
word “local” is that the resource is inlined in the Local resource property.

Remote Resource is a property that contains a reference to a remote resource.
“Remote” means only that the resource is not inlined in the property. It can exist in
the local document at different places in the hierarchy, or somewhere outside the
document. Remote Resource is similar to the Remote Property of Simple Xlinks.

Arc is a property that contains the description of the actual link between two of the
resources specified in the relationship. For each pair of resources specified in the
relationship object, one Arc property might exist.

Appendix B: Revision history

Version 1.03

• Defined ExtendedFeatureType and ObservationFeatureType
• Reduced the definition of geolinks to remote properties (Simple Xlinks)
• Changed the LOF schema to be compliant with the latest GML (2.0) and XML

Schema (October 2000) specifications
• Updated the version number to be consistent with the schema version number

Appendix C: Future considerations

This appendix lists items that we might consider for future development of the
LOF. This document was built during the OGC GFST and GFSPP projects and one
of the results of those projects is the list of “lessons learned” we summarize below.

• LOF should be made independent of the services that process it.
• LOF needs the notion of State and a State History. At the moment, the

Causal Narrative element captures very simple history information over the
time (narrative), but the State and State History would have the effect of
partitioning the LOF and dividing all of its elements into chunks by State.

• Introduce the relationships, as described in the section 3. Geolinks in
Location Organizer Folder.

• Minor structural cleaning. For example, feature metadata properties are
members of a PropertyGroup element named FeatureMetadata, while LOF
metadata elements are members of the LOF, directly. However, there is no
semantical difference between them, so we could use the same technique.

Issue Name: [Need for examples. (JVD, 3/28/01)]
Issue Description: [The LOF spec doesn't have any examples! It really should show/include
examples conveying XML instances of basic LOF elements such as 'areaOfInterest',
'informationElement', 'causalNarrative', 'informationElement' and 'lofMember' (features and
geolinks) elements (i.e., show real-world fragments of LOF "instance documents".]
Resolution: [Open. (name , date)]
