OWS-6 Testbed  
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver Engineering 
Reports and Chnage Requests into the OGC Specification Program, where they are 
formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of 
technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing interoperability problems 
posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include 
test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - 
all designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC 
standards. 
 
In April 2008, the OGC issued a call for sponsors for an OGC Web Services, Phase 6 (OWS-
6) Testbed activity. The activity completed in June 2009. There is a series of on-line 
demonstrations available here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/pub/www/ows6/index.html  
The OWS-6 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommended to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-6 initiative be organized around 
the following threads:  
 

1. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)  
 
2. Geo Processing Workflow (GPW)  
 
3. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM)  
 
4. Decision Support Services (DSS)  
 
5. Compliance Testing (CITE)  

 
The OWS-6 sponsoring organizations were:  
 

• U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)  
 

• Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD)  
 

• GeoConnections - Natural Resources Canada

Process of gathering information about the usage of resources by subjects. 
 
Ad hoc Sensor Network 
Sensor network in which communication links and/or nodes are not continually available 
or change dynamically. An ad hoc sensor network is often, but not necessarily, based on 
wireless communication between nodes with limited resources (energy supply, 
processing power). An ad hoc sensor network may include mobile sensors which belong 
to the network for a limited time or intermittently. 
 
Alert  
Synonym for notification. 
 
Application (derived from http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=glossary) 
Use of capabilities, including hardware, software and data, provided by an information 
system specific to the satisfaction of a set of user requirements in a given application 
domain. 
 
Application Domain (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Integrated set of problems, terms, information and tasks of a specific thematic domain 
that an application (e.g. an information system or a set of information systems) has to 
cope with. 
 
Note: One example of an application domain is environmental risk management. 
 
Application Schema (ISO 19109:2005) 
Conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications. 
 
Application Architecture (derived from OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Instantiation of a generic and open architecture (e.g. the ORCHESTRA Architecture) by 
inclusion of those thematic aspects that fulfil the purpose and objectives of a given 
application. The concepts for such an application stem from a particular application 
domain (e.g. a risk management application).  
 
Architecture (of a system) (ISO/IEC 10746-2:1996) 
Set of rules to define the structure of a system and the interrelationships between its parts.

functionality. 
 
Assertion (SOA-RA, 2008) 
An assertion is a proposition that is held to be true by a stakeholder. It is essentially a 
claim about the state of the world.  
 
Note: In the context of SAML the term Assertion is used as a synonymous expression for 
Ticket. 
 
Authentication (SOA-RA, 2008) 
Concerns the identity of the participants in an exchange. Authentication refers to the 
means by which one participant can be assured of the identity of other participants.

Catalogues include indexed listings of resource collections, their contents, their 
coverages, and of meta-information. A catalogue registers the existence, location, and 
description of resource collections held by an Information Community. Catalogues 
provide the capability to add, modify and delete entries. A minimum Catalogue will 
include the name for the resource collection and the locational handle that specifies 
where these data may be found. Each catalogue is unique to its Information Community. 
 
Component (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Hardware component (device) or Software Component. 
 
Conceptual model (ISO 19109:2005(E); ISO 19101)

companies that are involved in an application domain (e.g. risk management) and that use 
the applications built by the system users. 
 
Error (of a measurement) 
Difference between the measured value and the (in general unknown) ‘true value’ of the 
measured property.  
 
Event  
Anything that happens or is contemplated as happening at an instant or over an interval of

operates.  

2: (the environment) the natural world, especially as affected by human activity. 

3: (computing) Overall structure within which a user, computer, or program operates. 

Feature (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007; derived from ISO 19101) 
Abstraction of a real world phenomenon (ISO 19101) perceived in the context of an 
application. 
 
Framework (http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=glossary) 
An information architecture that comprises, in terms of software design, a reusable 
software template, or skeleton, from which key enabling and supporting services can be 
selected, configured and integrated with application code. 
 
Generic (Service, Infrastructure…) (derived from OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Independent on the organisation structure and application domain, etc. For example, a 
service is generic, if it is independent of the application domain. A service infrastructure 
is generic, if it is independent of the application domain and if it can adapt to different 
organisational structures at different sites, without programming (ideally). 
 
Geospatial (http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=glossary)

Referring to a location relative to the Earth's surface. “Geospatial” is more precise in 
many geographic information system contexts than "geographic," because geospatial 
information is often used in ways that do not involve a graphic representation, or map, of 
the information. 
 
Identity (Dictionary, 2004) 
Collective aspect of the set of characteristics by which a thing is definitively recognizable 
or known. 
 
Identity Provider 
Entity that issues identity information and possibly acts as authentication authority 
 
Implementation (http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=glossary) 
Software package that conforms to a standard or specification. A specific instance of a 
more generally defined system. 
 
Integrity (SOA-RA, 2008) 
Concerns the protection of information that is exchanged – either from unauthorized 
writing or inadvertent corruption. Integrity refers to the assurance that information that 
has been exchanged has not been altered. 
 
Interface (ISO 19119:2005) 
Named set of operations that characterize the behaviour of an entity.  
The aggregation of operations in an interface, and the definition of interface, shall be for 
the purpose of software reusability. The specification of an interface shall include a static 
portion that includes definition of the operations. The specification of an interface shall 
include a dynamic portion that includes any restrictions on the order of invoking the 
operations. 
 
Interoperability (ISO 19119:2005 or OGC; 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page= 
glossary) 
Capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among various functional 
units in a manner that require the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique 
characteristics of those units (ISO 2382-1).  
 
Meta-information (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Descriptive information about resources in the universe of discourse. Its structure is given 
by a meta-information model depending on a particular purpose. 
 
Note:  A resource by itself does not necessarily need meta-information. The need for 
meta-information arises from additional tasks or a particular purpose (like catalogue 
organisation), where many different resources (services and data objects) must be 
handled by common methods and therefore have to have/get common attributes and 
descriptions (like a location or the classification of a book in a library). 
 
Non-repudiation (SOA-RA, 2008) 

http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=glossary
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=%0Bglossary

Concerns the accountability of participants. To foster trust in the performance of a system 
used to conduct shared activities it is important that the participants are not able to later 
deny their actions: to repudiate them. Non-repudiation refers to the means by which a 
participant may not, at a later time, successfully deny having participated in the 
interaction or having performed the actions as reported by other participants. 
 
Notification  
Message that transports one or more events. Depending on the form of the event, the 
notification may resemble the event that it transports. 

Observed Property (derived from OGC 07-022r1) 
Identifier or description of the phenomenon for which the observation result provides an 
estimate of its value. 
 
Observation (OGC 07-022) 
Act of observing a property or phenomenon, with the goal of producing an estimate of the 
value of the property. 
 
Open Architecture (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Architecture whose specifications are published and made freely available to interested 
vendors and users with a view of widespread adoption of the architecture. An open 
architecture makes use of existing standards where appropriate and possible and 
otherwise contributes to the evolution of relevant new standards. 
 
Operation (ISO 19119:2005; http://www.OpenGIS.org/docs/02-112.pdf) 
Specification of a transformation or query that an object may be called to execute. An 
operation has a name and a list of parameters. 
 
Phenomenon (OGC 07-022) 
Concept that is a characteristic of one or more feature types, the value for which may be 
estimated by application of some procedure in an observation. 
 
Policy (derived from SOA-RM, 2006) 
Representation of a constraint or condition on the use, deployment, or description of a 
resource. 
 
Purpose (of meta-information) (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Describes the goal of the usage of the resources. 
 
(Service) Platform (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Set of infrastructural methods, technologies and rules that describe how to specify service 
interfaces and related information and how to invoke services in a distributed system.  
Examples for platforms are Web Services according to the W3C specifications including 
a GML profile for the representation of geographic information or a CORBA-based 
infrastructure with a UML profile according to the OMG specifications.

Profile 
Information (set of attributes) describing a subject. 
 
Reference Model (ISO Archiving Standards; http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 
nost/isoas/us04/defn.html) 
Framework for understanding significant relationships among the entities of some 
environment, and for the development of consistent standards or specifications 
supporting that environment. A reference model is based on a small number of unifying 
concepts and may be used as a basis for education and explaining standards to a non-
specialist. 
 
Representation (Richardson/Ruby 2007) 
Comprises any useful information about the current state of a resource. 

Resource  (Richardson/Ruby 2007) 
Anything that’s important enough to be referenced as a thing itself.  

Note: Applied to geospatial service-oriented architectures (derived from OGC 07-097; 
RM-OA 2007): Functions (possibly provided through services) or data objects (possibly 
modelled as features). 

Security Domain 
Set of resources protected in accordance with a common policy. 

Sensor 
Entity that provides information about an observed property at its output. A sensor uses a 
combination of physical, chemical or biological means in order to estimate the underlying 
observed property. At the end of the measuring chain electronic devices produce signals 
to be processed.  

Sensor Network 
A collection of sensors and optional processing nodes, in which information on properties 
observed by the sensors may be transferred and processed. 
 
Note: A particular type of a sensor network is an ad hoc sensor network. 
 
Sensor System 
System whose components are sensors. A sensor system as a whole may itself be referred 
to as a sensor with an own management and sensor output interface. In addition, the 
components of a sensor system are individually addressable.  
 
Service (ISO 19119:2005) 
Distinct part of the functionality that is provided by an entity through interfaces. 
 
Service Instance (derived from OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Executing manifestation of a software component that provides an external interface of a 
service according to an implementation specification for a given platform.

Service Network (derived from OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Set of service instances that interact in order to serve the objectives of applications. The 
basic unit within a service network for the provision of functions are the service 
instances. 
 
Session  
Also known as a communication session, is a semi-permanent interactive information 
exchange between communicating devices that is established at a certain time and torn 
down at a later time. 
 
Signal 
Any internal representation (i.e. internal to the sensor) of the observed property. 

Software Component (derived from component definition of 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resources/?page=glossary) 
Program unit that performs one or more functions and that communicates and 
interoperates with other components through common interfaces. 
 
Spatial Context 
Specification of a spatial location of an observed property determined by a combination 
of a point, a line, an area, a volume and/or a vector field. 
 
Note: As an example for the combination of an area and a point, consider a sensor that 
is capable of recording an image of an area. It may deliver both a spatial context for the 
area (e.g. the polygon of the area) and/or for several points within that area (e.g. a grid 
laid upon the area). 
 
Subject (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Abstract representation of a user or a software component in an application. 
 
System (ISO/IEC 10746-2:1996) 
Something of interest as a whole or as comprised of parts. Therefore a system may be 
referred to as an entity. A component of a system may itself be a system, in which case it 
may be called a subsystem. 
 
Note: For modelling purposes, the concept of system is understood in its general, system-
theoretic sense. The term "system" can refer to an information processing system but can 
also be applied more generally. 
 
System User (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007) 
Provider of services that are used for an application domain as well as IT architects, 
system developers, integrators and administrators that conceive, develop, deploy and run 
applications for an application domain. 
 
Temporal Context 
Specification of the temporal reference of an observed property based on the absolute 
time. It can be a single point in time, a time sequence, a time period or a combination of

these. In a sampling system for example several time periods and time points are needed 
to describe the time behaviour. However, a time point is already an abstraction which 
does not really exist. It means a very small time interval. 

Uncertainty 
Quantified description of the doubt about the measurement result.  
 
Note: The error of a measurement may be small, even though the uncertainty is large. 
 
User (OGC 07-097; RM-OA 2007)

signals (ITU-R Rec.TF.686-1 (1997)) 
 
Viewpoint (RM-ODP) 
Subdivision of the specification of a complete system, established to bring together those 
particular pieces of information relevant to some particular area of concern during the 
design of the system. 
 
Web Service  
Self-contained, self-describing, modular service that can be published, located, and 
invoked across the Web. A Web service performs functions, which can be anything from 
simple requests to complicated business processes. Once a Web service is deployed, other 
applications (and other Web services) can discover and invoke the deployed service.

20040211/#webservice)  
Software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a 
network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically 
WSDL). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its 
description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML 
serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards.

6 Development of Engineering Reports 

Overall, seven engineering reports have been developed in OWS-6. Though matching the 
initial plan in numbers, we slightly restructured the report portfolio. Instead of developing 
a separate engineering report, the UML models for SWE have been integrated into the 
SWE information model engineering report, as they manifest one essential component of 
the SWE information model itself. Further on, an additional engineering report was 
developed. It addresses discovery mechanisms in SWE. Originally planned to be part of 
the SWE Information Model ER, we decided to separate this part from the SWE 
Information Model ER, as it manifests the application of the SWE information models, 
but doesn't address the model as such. All other engineering reports have been delivered 
as planned. 

6.1 Georeferenceable Imagery ER - OGC 

Georeferenceable imagery is “a referenceable grid that has information that can be used 
to transform grid coordinates to external coordinates, but the transformation shall not be 
required to be an affine transformation”. Geolocation of georeferenceable imagery refers 
to the techniques described in ISO 19130, such as sensor models, functional fit models, 
and spatial registration using control points. 

The Georeferenceable Imagery workflow defined in OWS-6 addresses use cases that 
exercise the Sensor Web Enablement services, i.e. Sensor Planning Service (SPS), Sensor 
Observation Service with the optional transaction support (SOS-T), Web Processing 
Service (WPS), and Web Coverage Service with the transaction support (WCS-T). The 
technical foci have been to enable instant access to time-sensitive imagery at different 
processing levels, to geo-locate the imagery of interest, and to propagate uncertainty 
statistics. The uncertainty statistics are to be preserved and passed along the workflow by 
encoding them in the metadata section. The uncertainty statistics include both the quality 
information of sensing and encoding at sensors or processing nodes and covariance 
matrices introduced in the processing by comparing the input and outputs at the node. 
The metadata should be usable within sensor models to describe parameters uncertainty 
as well as in datasets to report geometric (and radiometric) accuracy.  

The mechanism and strategy for uncertainty information to propagate along the workflow 
have been of the core concepts to be demonstrated in the OWS-6 Testbed. Both rectified 
imagery and unrectified imagery should have relevant uncertainty information. In the 
case of unrectified imagery, the metadata should consist of observation (O&M) metadata, 
sensor model with adjustable parameters, and parameter uncertainty information. In the 
case of rectified imagery, the metadata should consist of coverage metadata and 
geometric positioning uncertainty.  

The uncertainty information has been proposed to be encoded in SensorML and SWE 
Common, following the Community Sensor Model WG profiles. A SensorML profile has 
been developed for this task.  

The de-facto industrial workflow scripting language, Business Process Execution 
Language (BPEL), has been used as the main language for composing the workflow 



OGC 09-064r2

considering the accumulated experiences over several OWS initiatives and the wide 
support of design tools from either commercial or open-source. This leads to the 
requirement of adapting each OGC-compliant services to be used in the workflow. The 
practice to harmonize the service components and chain the services into a mega-service 
or a workflow can be helpful in the development of individual Web services. 

6.2 SWE Information Model ER 

The SWE Information Model ER discusses relations between SensorML, SWE Common 
and GML and investigates solutions for increased synergy between them. This effort has 
been supported by UML models of the data types used in SWE and GML. 

In addition, the report discusses the integration of additional markup languages into OGC 
SWE. We experimented and documented the findings in the engineering report about the 
usage and integration of UncertML (has been integrated into different SWE encodings, 
namely SWE Common and Observations and Measurements), MathML and EML into 
the SWE environment with an emphasis on SensorML processes and processing. 

After consultation with participants and sponsors, we decided to develop an additional 
engineering report that was initially not foreseen for this testbed: The OGC® OWS-6 
SensorML Profile for Discovery Engineering Report defines a basic SensorML profile 
for discovery purposes. Besides a minimum set of metadata also the structure of 
according SensorML documents is defined in order to ensure a consistent metadata 
description. A set of Schematron rules allows validating if a given SensorML document 
complies with this profile. 

6.3 SensorML Profile for Discovery ER 

The SensorML Profile for Discovery ER specifies a profile of the SensorML OGC 
standard to be used by sensor and SWE service discovery services and clients. The 
profile is not restricted to any specific type of sensor or procedure. It can be used as a 
generic profile for sensor system descriptions with the purpose of being discoverable. 
The ER uses an exemplarily home weather station to explain the concept of the profile. 

6.4 Change Requests 

A single change request has been produced by the SWE thread of OWS-6. It addresses 
the integration of additional markups in SensorML. The change request has been posted 
to OGC pending documents as OGC document 08-192r1. 

6.5 Event Architecture ER 

The Event Architecture Engineering Report describes the first version of an OGC Event 
Architecture. It does so by defining an abstract architecture and by providing guidance 
how this architecture can be implemented using existing standards. Several existing OGC 
standards deal with aspects of an event architecture to a certain extent. These are, for 
example, the Sensor Alert Service (SAS), Sensor Event Service (SES) and Web 
Notification Service (WNS). While the former define a Publish/Subscribe approach for 



OGC 09-064r2

the Sensor Web domain in their specific ways, the latter provides functionality for 
relaying messages via various protocols. 

6.6 Secure Sensor Web ER 

The Secure Sensor Web Engineering Report represents the first effort ever to analyze 
security aspects in Sensor Web application. The report provides a detailed analysis of 
potential vulnerabilities and threats typical for OGC SWE services. 

6.7 CCSI ER 

This CCSI Engineering Report outlines the concepts, best practices, and lessons learned 
gathered from integrating Common Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
(CBRN) Sensor Interface (CCSI) standard-compliant sensors into an OGC Sensor Web 
Enablement (SWE)-based architecture.  The document also specifies a web service 
interface for interacting with CCSI sensors and defines the basis for a profile that can be 
used to represent CCSI sensor definitions, data, and commands in SWE formats. 

6.8 PulseNet ER 

The PulseNet ER describes Northrop Grumman’s contribution from PulseNet™ to the 
Common Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Sensor Interface 
(CCSI) standard-compliant sensors into an OGC SWE-based architecture.

7 Development of Implementations 

The following implementations were developed in OWS6. 

7.1 Event Service for AIM 

Based on the SWE services SAS and SES as well as the ideas and techniques described in 
the Event Architecture ER an Event Service was implemented. This task was a cross-
thread activity between the SWE thread providing experience on alerting and 
notifications and AIM thread providing a comprehensive use case. In this use case the 
event service was used to filter and forward events regarding air traffic to subscribed 
pilots using user (pilot) defined spatial and temporal filter criteria. 

7.2 Clients & Services for Georeferenceable Imagery  

A number of Web services and corresponding clients have been developed to support the 
georeferenceable imagery workflow. The following figure illustrates this workflow.

A SPS was developed to task SPOT satellites. The interface design of this SPS reflected 
the new SPS 2.0 design to a large extent. The service was developed by SpotImage.

7.2.2 JPIP-enabled SOS-T 

We implemented a transactional SOS for standardized access to georeferenceable. This 
SOS is coupled with a JPIP server to distribute and allowing fast access to the image data 
in the JPEG 2000 format. The SOS is also responsible to offer the metadata to the 
images. These metadata is encoded in SensorML and contains error and uncertainty 
statistics, which supports and improves the georeferencing of the imagery. The service 
was developed by 52°North. 

7.2.3 WPS 

A WPS was implemented to serve the georectified imagery.  The service was developed 
by GMU. 

7.2.4 WCS-T 

A transactional WCS was implemented to store the rectified imagery and to serve it in 
JPEG2000 format using JPIP streaming server. The service was developed by GMU. 

7.2.5 Workflow Engine 

A workflow engine was used to execute and control the entire workflow. The workflow 
itself is encoded as a BPEL script. The existing workflow engine was enhanced to 
support to pass the security token in the workflow. The workflow engine was developed 
by GMU. 

7.2.6 SPS Client 

A client application based on the Space Time Toolkit was developed to task SPOT 
satellites. SpotImage developed the client. 

7.2.7 Imagery Client 

The imagery client supported access to image data provided by SOS and WCS. The client 
is based on OWS-5 work and can be used to display the imagery coming from a JPIP 
server. This work included TIE testing of the client with GMU’s WCS. Further on, the 
client was enhanced to error statistics and adjustable parameters associated with a sensor 
process model. 52°North developed this client. 

7.3 Clients & Services for CCSI 

A number of Web services and corresponding clients have been developed to support the 
CCSI workflow. The following figure illustrates this workflow.

Figure 2: CCSI Workflow Overview 

7.3.1 Catalog Service 

The catalog service supported the discovery of CCSI sensors. Galdos developed the 
catalog, with registered services and clients from Compusult, Northrop Grumman, and 
JPEO-CBD. 

7.3.2 STS 

The secure token service provided secure tokens to be used with the policy enforcement 
and decision points. Con terra developed the STS. 

7.3.3 SAS, SPS, SOS 

All SWE Web services have been implemented to support security enabled SWE-
workflows. Compusult developed those services. 

7.3.4 SIS 

The Service Interface Service, developed by Northrop Grumman, acts as a bridge 
between CCSI sensors and OGC SWE Web services.  

7.3.5 PEP & PDP 

The policy decision and enforcement points, together with the secure token service, 
provide a secure environment for SWE services. Con terra developed both services.  

7.3.6 CCSI Sensors 

JPEO-CBD provided a CCSI sensor emulator that was used to developed the SIS and to 
test the communication between various OGC SWE services and the CCSI sensors.

7.3.7 CCSI Clients 

Two client applications have been developed. Compusult developed a Web based client, 
whereas Northrop Grumman provided a thick, .Net-based client. Both clients are 
"security enabled" and corresponded with all OGC SWE services.

8 Lessons Learnt 

OWS-6 SWE was a complex thread with a number of sub-threads. The experiences we 
made, both positive and negative, are listed in the following table.  

Aspect Works fine Needs further improvements 

X-thread 
coordination 

X-thread coordination is a 
complex and very time-
consuming task. This is mainly 
due to the different schedules 
within the different threads. For 
that reason, X-thread activities 
have been minimized without 
loosing interoperability aspects. 
The late integration into the demo 
scenario was not an issue. 

none 

Timing The timing of a large project such 
as a Testbed is always an issue. 
Nevertheless, the SWE thread 
finished perfectly in time, with 
final delivery of demo material 
end of March and delivery of 
engineering reports by April 17. If 
the timing is clear at the 
beginning of the project, timely 
delivery works fine. 

Timely delivery has to be ensured 
across all threads to allow better 
planning for all participants. For 
some participants, it is in an issue 
if demos etc. get delayed due to 
late delivery by other threads. 

Some aspects, such as additional 
change requests, only become 
visible by reviewing the final 
engineering reports. Therefore, the 
overall schedule shall provide 
some spare time to work on those 
changes requests. Thus, the final 
date shall not be identical with the 
delivery of the engineering reports. 
Another four weeks seem to be 
appropriate.  

Final Event Although the final event was 
somewhat undefined at the 
beginning of the project, it 
worked out well for SWE. 

An earlier definition of the final 
event would help to optimize the 
preparation.

9 Recommendations for future work 

The participants in the OWS6 SWE thread recommend the following work items be 
addressed in the next phases of SWE. 

9.1 Event Architecture 

Work on the Event Architecture report revealed several work items that should be 
incorporated in future OGC SWG work and Testbeds. 

9.1.1 Development of an Event Service Specification 

The OGC should consider the development of an Event Service specification that builds 
upon the concepts of the abstract Event Architecture and clearly defines a Pub/Sub 
service model and its implementation in various architectural styles. While the Event 
Architecture report deals with the general architecture, the Event Service specification 
could deal with the implementation details of an OGC Pub/Sub service. The specification 
will define a standalone service (either a simple notification producer or a broker service) 
and will at the same time define how other services implement Pub/Sub functionality. So 
it is envisioned to define all the specific implementation details that need to be defined 
for the geospatial domain. This work will need to take into account existing standards and 
cope with the various flavors of architectural styles that are important to the OGC.  

The Event Service specification should ideally define interfaces or resources, which can 
easily be added to OGC service specifications. Profiles or extensions could be defined to 
handle specific usage scenarios. 

9.1.2 Revision / Extension of OGC Baseline 

The report examines the definition of the term event and its model with respect to the 
OGC baseline. Events are a special form of feature, where the temporal aspect is the most 
important one. 

Coverages and observations have already been identified as important feature 
specializations and are explicitly mentioned in according documents, e.g. ISO 19101. In 
OWS-6, we performed a thorough investigation of events with respect to the General 
Feature Model. The results should be discussed by the OGC community, especially if the 
concept of events is significant enough to include it in the definition of features in ISO 
19101. In addition, it would be appropriate to develop a dedicated abstract specification 
that deals with the special aspects of events and event-driven systems. This would 
provide a basis for further developments in the area of event-driven geospatial data 
infrastructures and could use the results of the Event Architecture report as a foundation. 

9.1.3 Enhancement of Bounding Information in Feature Encodings 

ISO 19136 / GML encodes features with a boundedBy property that is of spatial 
(gml:Envelope) or spatio-temporal type (gml:EnvelopeWithTimePeriod). The 
boundedBy property should explicitly allow pure temporal types, like TM_Primitive 
(encoded as gml:AbstractTimePrimitive), to support the encoding of events as features. 



OGC 09-064r2 

26 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.
 

9.1.4 Enhancement of Gazetteer to Handle Temporal Locations 

The gazetteer specification needs to be extended so that also temporal locations can be 
identified (like "Backup 28278", "Version 2.0 Release Date"), just like spatial locations. 

This feature would enable usage of temporal identifiers, which is especially useful for 
events. As an example, think of events that happened at a well-known point in time. 
Humans refer to this time usually by using an identifier. “9/11” is the latest most 
prominent example; “French Revolution” or “Independence Day” are others. A given 
domain usually assigns identifiers, so that ambiguities can be avoided. 

9.1.5 Investigation and Improvement of Subscription Models and Filter Languages 

The Event Architecture ER provides an overview of different subscription models that 
can be applied in Pub/Sub scenarios. One of them is using filters to define the events of 
interest. The OGC Filter Encoding is one candidate for per-message content filters, while 
the Event Pattern Markup Language (EML) is an example of an OGC standard for 
enabling complex event processing. The applicability of these and other filter and 
processing languages (e.g. XPath 1.0 / 2.0, XQuery etc.) needs to be investigated in more 
detail and enhanced or adapted if required. 

To improve support of event processing functionality in an OGC Event Architecture, the 
EML will need to be revised and extended. New versions of the EML should take into 
account the newest version of the OGC Filter Encoding and include spatial views and 
better support invocations of other services like a WPS. This will enable a higher 
flexibility when composing event processing models and lead to more reactivity of 
service oriented architectures. Enabling event processing in OGC services and SDIs will 
be of high interest in the future. 

Group, channel and type based subscription models are other ways to define which 
notifications a client is interested in. In WS-Notification, these models are supported with 
subscription topics. In the future we need to investigate how exactly we need to model 
these topics to suit our needs. Various types of metadata can be added to a WS-Topic. 

9.1.6 Testing and Implementing the Event Architecture 

The report describes possible ways to event-enable existing OGC services. We suggest 
that an upcoming OGC Testbed should have a dedicated thread with the goal to 
prototypically realize the event architecture. This Testbed thread could deal with common 
architectural aspects, not only with eventing but also with aspects of different 
architectural styles. 

These different styles are also of interest for the realization of the Event Architecture. 
While the report presents an approach to realize the architecture for POX and SOAP / 
WS-* using WS-Notification, it does not give a solution for REST. In addition, that WS-
Notification works for POX has to be proven – a good topic for a Testbed, especially 
because many OGC service implementations use the POX style. We also explained in the 
report that WS-Eventing, another approach for doing Pub/Sub, is in the process of 
finalization at W3C. A comparison of OASIS WS-Notification and W3C WS-Eventing

standards needs be performed once WS-Eventing has reached the final status. This will 
show which of these standards better supports the OGC requirements. These 
requirements need to be investigated in more detail in the future. Again, performing tests 
– like in the AIM thread of OWS-6, best solves this. 

Both WS-Notification and –Eventing come together with other WS-* standards to 
manage resources. An investigation of the relationship of these standards with REST 
should be performed, especially under the aspect of best compatibility between the two 
approaches when HTTP is the application protocol / transport binding used. 

SOAP 1.2 outlines how a web friendly use of SOAP would look like, using HTTP GET 
for information retrieval only, while POST should be used to invoke real operations. By 
constraining the resource identification information into the URI part of a WS-
Addressing endpoint and not into its reference parameters, higher web friendliness could 
be achieved. This should be experimented with in an OGC Testbed, to improve the 
understanding of the different architectural styles, their commonalities and the options for 
harmonization when HTTP is used. 

For testing and furthering the implementation of the Event Architecture, a larger use case 
that ideally integrates as many of the existing OGC web service standards as possible is 
envisioned. Data processing workflows, as have been demonstrated before, could be the 
basis of such a use case. The implementation of the event architecture could benefit by 
leveraging Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technology. The scenario could also be used to 
demonstrate on-the-fly (complex event) processing and transformations between different 
encodings and protocols. 

The definition of an event taxonomy or hierarchy in support of the implementation of the 
OGC Event Architecture would be another aspect of the envisioned Testbed thread. For 
this, the taxonomy examples presented in the report can be used as a starting point. Such 
developments could be done together with the development of topics and topic 
namespaces for OGC services. 

9.1.7 Develop and Implement Policies for OGC Web Services 

Policies for web services are a means to specify the behavior of a service instance. This 
may for example enable clients to define whether notifications that match their 
subscriptions should be transmitted reliably or not. Policies allow services to indicate the 
executed behavior but also which options clients have to modify the behavior. Clients 
may use policies to request specific behavior. It has to be investigated which behavior 
definitions (i.e., policies) are needed by OGC services today and how they can be 
integrated into the architecture. Policies to define subscription, caching, filter precision 
etc. can be imagined. 

9.2 SWE Information Model 

We discussed several potential topics for future Testbeds in regard to the SWE 
information model and its derivable discovery mechanisms. The following aspects are the 
most important:

9.2.1 Optimization of OGC Catalog Service Web with Sensor Web requirements 

It is necessary to extend the OGC Catalogue in certain parts to the specific needs of 
sensor/sensor data and SWE service discovery. The CSW developments within the SWE 
thread of OWS-6 are a good foundation - though they do not yet sufficiently support the 
various Sensor Web characteristics. Still missing are thoroughly defined mechanisms for 
dealing with e.g. specialized metadata harvesting, improved adaption to SWE data 
encodings and especially the handling of the implicitly highly dynamic sensor 
characteristics. 

9.2.2 Metadata profile for sensor discovery 

Further work on the SensorML profile for discovery (see OWS-6 ER) is necessary. In 
addition, it will be necessary how such an advanced metadata profile for sensors can be 
matched to Catalogue data models (ebRIM, ISO 19115). Formal documents and 
specifications are necessary. 

9.2.3 Dictionaries for identifiers 

For example, URIs identify the phenomena measured by a sensor within a SensorML 
document. In order to ensure a consistent use of these phenomenon identifiers and to 
make the definitions that are assigned to these URIs accessible, it is necessary to provide 
a phenomenon dictionary or registry. An important functionality would be an operation 
providing access to the phenomenon definitions (e.g. resolving the URIs) but also for 
exploiting semantic relationships (e.g. finding equivalent or similar definitions). 

9.3 CCSI 

The integration of CCSI technologies and sensors was the first time that OGC addressed 
the integration of a specific domain into OGC SWE. We made essential findings during 
this process and recommend to address the following aspects in future Testbeds: 

• Enhance the Sensor Interface Service (SIS) and the CCSI-SWE plug-in to include 
full documentation and delivery of the source code to the JPEO-CBD 

• Modularize SIS by developing a Plugin for SIS and test the SIS and CCSI-SWE 
plug-in to obtain OGC certification of the CCSI-SWE plug-in as an official OGC 
release of a CCSI-SWE interface 

• Perform the demonstration with actual CBRN sensors 

• Review/update/improve mappings from CCSI sensor descriptions and data to 
SensorML and O & M and vice versa.  Review and improve mappings from SPS 
InputDescriptor format to CCSI command format. 

• Improve the integration of security components into the architecture and evaluate 
more complex security scenarios using CCSI sensors.

9.4 Georeferenceable Imagery 

The following issues have emerged in the context of OWS-6 and shall be addressed in 
future Testbeds. 

9.4.1 WSDL / BPEL for OGC Web Services 

Workflow WSDLs: One of the main operations is to refine the WSDL for each individual 
service and associate proper schemas. This is necessary to pass parameters from one 
service to another service. Currently, the BPEL engine and designer cannot use the rich 
GetCapabilities information for every OGC-service. It is recommended that OWS-7 open 
a thread, under either the GPW or the SWE or a cross-thread, to develop a specification 
and techniques specifically to handle the OGC geospatial Web services and workflows 
with the BPEL specification. This would reduce the work of refining WSDL. 

Extensions to the current BPEL scripts are clearly needed for dealing with security or 
other information that must be embedded in the header of the SOAP message. The 
current BPEL specification does not support embedding, retrieving, and passing the 
information available in the SOAP header. If the invocation of the service does not 
recognize the WS-Security policy tag in the header, the information is ignored and lost. If 
BPEL is the choice of scripting language, a revision with support for accessing the 
optional header information must be provided. It is also necessary to support the newly-
emerged WSDL 2.0 and to comply with the new WS-Addressing and WS-Security 
standards, to achieve asynchronous/stateful Web services and security of information. In 
summary, the areas security, asynchronous communication, and WSDL 2.0 should be 
reconsidered and extended. 

9.4.2 Uncertainty and Error Propagation 

Error propagation is a new addition to the SWE workflow. UncertML may be a candidate 
to describe the quality of service and data. The problem of describing and propagating the 
uncertainty information along a workflow can become unworkable under the current 
system when the following aspects are considered. 

a. Appending of an error matrix to the collection of error matrices and growing the 
collection along the workflow 

b. Inserting a self-introduced error matrix into the collection of error matrices. 

c. SWE Common might be extended to contain a data type dedicated to provide 
statistical information (e.g. distributions) but no specific value. 

9.4.3 Events in Workflows 

With the introduction of SES, the use of SES in the workflow should be studied. On the 
error propagation along the workflow, the solution should be standardized across 
different OWSs, i.e. either SOS, WCS, or WPS should have a common mechanism to 
introduce, pass along and accrue error information. This should be especially important 
when the workflow becomes very complicated. At the end, users may be interested in

knowing all the error sources and re-evaluating the errors themselves when necessary. A 
common mechanism would simplify the user experience. 

9.5 Secure Sensor Web 

Implementation of a secure Sensor Planning Service in order to eliminate the explored 
vulnerabilities and possible attacks as described in the OWS-6 Secure Sensor Web ER 
(OGC #08-176).  

The implementation shall aim to guarantee all relevant requirements in order to pass 
assurance evaluation tests as specified in “Common Criteria” (ISO 15408) or the TCSEC 
(Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria – also known as “The Orange Book”). For 
further information, please see the section “Recommendations” in OGC document 08-
176.
