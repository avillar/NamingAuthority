The Common DataBase (CDB) Specification provides the means for a single, 
versionable, simulation-rich, synthetic representation of the earth.  A database that 
conforms to this Specification is referred to as a Common DataBase or CDB.  A CDB 
provides for a synthetic environment repository that is plug-and-play interoperable 
between database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB can be used as a common 
on-line (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-devices can 
simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to perform their 
respective runtime simulation tasks; in this case, a CDB is plug-and-play interoperable 
between CDB-compliant simulators.  A CDB can be readily used by existing simulation 
client-devices (legacy Image Generators, Radar simulator, Computer Generated Forces, 
etc.) through a data publishing process that is performed on-demand in real-time. 

The application of CDB to future simulator architectures will significantly reduce 
runtime-source level and algorithmic correlation errors, while reducing development, 
update and configuration management timelines.  With the addition of the HLA/FOM 
and DIS protocols, the application of the CDB Specification provides a Common 
Environment to which inter-connected simulators share a common view of the simulated 
environment. 

The CDB Specification is an open format Specification for the storage, access and 
modification of a synthetic environment database.  The Specification defines the data 
representation, organization and storage structure of a worldwide synthetic representation 
of the earth as well as the conventions necessary to support all of the subsystems of a 
full-mission simulator.  The Specification makes use of several commercial and 
simulation data formats endorsed by leaders of the database tools industry. 

The CDB synthetic environment is a representation of the natural environment including 
external features such as man-made structures and systems.  It encompasses the terrain 
relief, terrain imagery, three-dimensional (3D) models of natural and man-made cultural 
features, 3D models of dynamic vehicles, the ocean surface, and the ocean bottom, 
including features (both natural and man-made) on the ocean floor.  In addition, the 
synthetic environment includes the specific attributes of the synthetic environment data 
as well as their relationships. 

A CDB contains datasets organized in layers, tiles and levels-of-detail; together, these 
datasets represent the features of a synthetic environment for the purposes of distributed 
simulation applications.  The organization of the synthetic environmental data in a CDB 
is specifically tailored for real-time applications.

ii. Preface 
The industry-maintained Common CDB has been discussed and demonstrated at OGC 
Technical Committee meetings beginning in September, 2013.   

At the suggestion of several attendees at the first CDB ad-hoc meeting in September, 
2014, the current version of the existing CDB specification has been slightly reformatted 
for publication as an OGC Best Practice.

1. Scope 

The full CDB specification, in its current, industry-maintained format and version, 
addresses the interoperability challenge of full plug-and-play interoperability and re-use 
of synthetic environment databases used for high fidelity simulation and mission 
rehearsal. 

The first CDB specification was developed under a competitive contract awarded to CAE 
to meet requirements of the United States Special Operations Command.  The CDB 
Specification was required to be open and non-proprietary as part of the original 
requirements.  The revision history of the industry-maintained specification is contained 
in the following document sections. 

The CDB specification was been widely implemented by multiple, independent industry 
contractors for end-user simulation and mission rehearsal customers in many different 
countries over a period of ten years. 

For ease of editing and review, the specification has been separated into two Volumes.  
Volume 1 contains the main body of the specification, and Volume 2 contains the 
appendices.  Nevertheless, the documents remain large and verbose, as the current, 
industry maintained specification has functioned as a data model, an encoding 
specification, and an engineering tutorial on how to implement this new and different 
simulation synthetic environment paradigm. 

The remainder of this document comprises Volume 2.

Appendix A 

A. Guidelines, Clarifications, Rationales, Primers, Information 

A.1 Guideline: Creating a 3D Model for a Powerline Pylon 
The goal of this guideline is to model a typical high voltage electrical pylon resembling the one 
in this figure. This guideline is based on version 3.1 of the Specification, but is applicable to 
version 3.0 as well. 

 

 
Figure A-1: Typical Electrical Pylon 

 

A.1.1 Pylon Model Orientation 
The front (and back) of a powerline pylon is aligned with the general direction of the attached 
wires as illustrated below.

Figure A-2: Pylon Orientation 

 

The above snapshot is similar to the one found in Figure 6–10 of the Specification. 

 

A.1.2 OpenFlight Graph 
The graph of the above pylon exposes the 3 cross-arms, each with 2 insulators where wires are 
attached.  Here are the names of the components that are used to model this power pylon: 

 Pylon (global zone) 
 Arm (horizontal cross-arm at the top of the structure) 
 Insulator (ceramic insulator string attached at the end of each arm) 

These 3 names are used to create CDB Zones as explained in section 6.5 of the Specification.  
Here is the first level of the resulting graph. 

Pylon

Object Arm[1] Arm[2] Arm[3]
 

The rounded rectangle named Object is an OpenFlight object node containing the geometry of 
the concrete base and lattice steel structure of the pylon, but excluding the geometry of the cross-
arms.  Arm[1] is the lowest cross-arm; Arm[2] is the middle one; Arm[3] is the top one.  Each 
arm is then made of a steel structure and 2 insulators. 

Arm[n]

Object Insulator[1] Insulator[2]

Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014

Again, Object represents the steel structure of the cross-arm without the insulators.  When 
looking at one of the cross-arm of the power pylon from the back, Insulator[1] is to the left while 
Insulator[2] is to the right.  Finally, each insulator has an attach point to indicate where to 
connect an eventual wire. 

Insulator[n]

Object Attach_Point
 

The node Object contains the geometry of the insulator. 

As explained in section 6.8 of the Specification, the resulting list of paths is as follow: 

 \Pylon 
 \Pylon\Arm[1] 
 \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[1] 
 \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[1]\Attach_Point 
 \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[2] 
 \Pylon\Arm[1]\Insulator[2]\Attach_Point 
 \Pylon\Arm[2] 
 \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[1] 
 \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[1]\Attach_Point 
 \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[2] 
 \Pylon\Arm[2]\Insulator[2]\Attach_Point 
 \Pylon\Arm[3] 
 \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[1] 
 \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[1]\Attach_Point 
 \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[2] 
 \Pylon\Arm[3]\Insulator[2]\Attach_Point 

Note the presence of a total of 6 attach points (1 attach point per insulator × 2 insulators per 
cross-arm × 3 cross-arms per pylon = 6 attach points per pylon).  Even though all attach points 
have the same name, there is a unique path to reach each one.  For this reason, there is no 
ambiguity identifying and locating each point. 

 

A.1.3 Attach Point Orientation 
When creating the attach point of the insulator, pay attention to its orientation.  Since the cable 
attaches underneath the insulator, the Z-axis of the local coordinate system (LCS) must be 
pointing down.  To achieve a proper positioning of the attach point, the modeler usually inserts 
two transformations in the node, one translation and one rotation.  The translation positions the 
point underneath the insulator while the rotation changes the orientation of the Z-axis.  Make 
sure to leave the Y-axis in the direction of the wire as in the figure below. 
 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014

Figure A-3: Attach Point Orientation 

 

In this figure, the position and orientation of the attach point is identified by the blue-red-green 
axis system beneath the insulator.  The Y-axis is in red and points in the same direction as the 
model’s Y-axis, which is toward the front of the model.  The Z-axis is in green and points down 
indicating that wires attach under the insulator. 

 

A.2 Guideline: Generating Wires between Pylons of a Powerline 
This guideline is intended for both modelers and developers responsible for the creation of: 

 CDB content such as 3D models representing pylons 
 Tools used to generate the Powerline Network datasets 
 Client-devices that use the Powerline Network datasets to generate pylons and 

wires along the transmission line. 
The article is based on version 3.0 of the CDB Specification. 

 

A.2.1 Powerline Network Attributes 
The table below is the collection of class and instance-level attributes from tables 5-46 and 5-47 
of the CDB Specification. 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0

FACC BBW 

FSC BSR 

JID HGT

The occurrence of some of the optional attributes depends on the occurrence of other optional 
attributes.  In particular, when MODL is present, other attributes become required while others 
remain optional.  The table below provides the relation between MODL and other attributes. 

 

Table A-2: MODL-related Attributes 
Required Optional 

BSR AO1 

HGT BBH, BBL, BBW 

MODT SCALn 

 

As a result of the above tables, a CDB-compliant Powerline Network dataset requires 11 
mandatory attributes (listed in the first column of Table A-1).  Optionally, when a 3D model 
representing a pylon is provided, 4 additional attributes are required (MODL obviously, plus 
BSR, HGT, and MODT) and 5 others remain optional (AO1, BBH, BBL, BBW, and SCALn).

A.2.2 Generation of HGT 
The HGT attribute represents a special case because table 5-47 suggests that the attribute is 
optional while, in fact, it should always be present.  If you carefully read its description in 
paragraph 5.3.1.2.3.17, you realize that HGT is required in both the lineal and figure point 
features of the Powerline Network. 

In the lineal features, HGT represents the average height above ground of the powerline when no 
MODL is specified, as suggested by the discussion about HGT in section 5.3.1.17 of the 
Specification.  In the figure point features, HGT represents the height above ground of the pylon, 
whether or not a MODL is provided.  In either file, when MODL is supplied, HGT represents the 
height of the 3D model above the ground. 

You should read guideline A.3 for a complete discussion about HGT 

 

A.2.3 Pylon Orientation 
If the orientation of the pylon is specified by AO1, then use the value as-is.  If the orientation is 
not specified, the client device must compute its value using the orientation of the segments of 
the lineal that are adjacent to the pylon.  In the case of the first and last segments, the orientation 
of the segment is also the orientation of the pylon.  For the other segments, the orientation of the 
pylon is the average of the orientation of the two adjacent segments. 

 

A.2.4 Number of Wires 
When no MODL is provided at all – meaning no MODL for the lineal and none for the figure 
points – and because there is no attribute specifying the number of wires along the transmission 
line, the client device must assume a generic powerline with two wires separated by a width of 
WGP meters connecting generic posts (simple pylons) of HGT meters high. 

When a common MODL is specified for the whole lineal and no figure points are provided, it is 
possible to determine the number of wires by counting the number of attach points in the 3D 
model.  Refer to guideline A.1.2 for details on how to detect attach points. 

If specific MODLs are defined through figure points, the number of attach points in each 3D 
model of the collection of all MODLs referenced by the powerline network must be identical.  
For instance, if the lineal refers to a generic pylon supporting 4 wires, then all specific pylons 
referenced as figure points must also support 4 wires.  Furthermore, the general configuration of 
all pylons must be identical.  If the general pylon supports 6 wires configured as a matrix of 2 
wires horizontally by 3 wires vertically, then all specific pylons must also share the same 
configuration.

A.2.5 How to Connect Wires to Attach Points 
If the client device has a single generic pylon along the line, then there is no problem connecting 
wires and attach points.  That is when multiple pylons are used along the same line that problems 
arise.  The client has to match attach points from one type of pylon to attach points on another 
pylon that may be of a different type.  In CDB Spec 3.0, the algorithm to determine how to 
connect pylons of different types is left to the client device. The future version of CDB 
Specification will provide a robust and deterministic approach on how to connect the wires. 

 

A.3 Guideline: How to Interpret the AHGT, HGT, BSR, BBH, and Z Attributes 
The goal of this guideline is to promote a correct use of five CDB attributes: AHGT, HGT, BSR, 
BBH, and Z.  The article is aimed to both developers and users of content creation tools as well 
as developers of client applications.  The guideline is based on version 3.1 of the Specification, 
but remains applicable to version 3.0 as well. 

A picture being worth a thousand words, the following diagram should help understand the 
relations between the AHGT, HGT, BSR, BBH, and Z attributes. 

 

Here is a reminder of what these attributes are.  The complete definitions can be found in Section 
5.3.1.3, CDB Attributes. 

 AHGT (Absolute Height) is a flag to interpret correctly the value of the Z 
coordinate of a feature.  When false, the value of Z is relative to the ground 
(Zr); when true, Z is the absolute altitude (Za). 

 AHGT is not related with HGT even though their names are similar. 
 HGT (Height Above Surface Level) is the distance from the top of the model 

to the ground. 
 BBH (Bounding Box Height) is the distance from the top of the model to its 

XY plane. 
 BSR (Bounding Sphere Radius) encompasses the portion of the model that is 

above its XY plane. 
 Z is the altitude of a feature, either absolute or relative to the ground. 

In the diagram above, a model (MODL) is positioned above the ground.  This is indicated by the 
fact that the model’s XY plane does not lie directly on the ground.  The distance above the

ground is represented by Zr.  The diagram clearly shows the relation between HGT, BBH, and 
Zr. 

𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 + 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 

When the value of Zr is not readily available from the instance of the feature itself (because 
AHGT is true), it can be computed using the ground height (Gh). 

𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 = 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 − 𝐺𝐺ℎ 

The BBH attribute is optional and defaults to twice the value of BSR, which is mandatory for a 
MODL model. 

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑  𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 = 2×𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 

𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑  𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟  𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 

 

A.3.1 Typical Use-case 
Typically, a model is positioned relative to the ground without any offset.  As a result, AHGT is 
false, and Zr is set to zero.  Hence… 

𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 

 

A.3.2 Light Points 
In the case of airport and environmental light points, no model of a light fixture is provided (the 
MODL attribute is not allowed).  Hence… 

𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 = 0   → 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 = 0 

Since, in version 3.1 of the CDB Specification, the light point datasets do not allow the HGT 
attribute, the client application may have to compute its value using the equation given 
previously… 

𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 + 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 

where BBH is null.  

𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 = 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 

And if the light point is positioned at an absolute height (AHGT is true), then… 

𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 = 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 − 𝐺𝐺ℎ

A.3.3 Recommendation 
Refrain from using AHGT.  There are several advantages to leave this flag to false.  First, it 
facilitates the creation of CDB datasets that are independent of each others.  When the Z 
coordinate (altitude) of a feature is relative to the ground, the elevation dataset can be updated 
without the need to recompute and update all features that have an absolute altitude. 

Second, when a feature has an absolute altitude, it is possible that it will end up being displayed 
below the ground by a given client.  How is this possible?  Isn’t it an error in the database itself?  
No, this is not an error.  It is perfectly possible to create content that is valid and – still – produce 
an incorrect result at the client level.  Consider a feature that is positioned with an absolute 
height in a valley between two mountains of a high resolution terrain profile.  At coarse LOD of 
terrain elevation, the valley and the mountains may (and will) be flattened producing a terrain 
skin that may no longer pass underneath the feature.  Now imagine a client that uses that coarse 
LOD of elevation to create a terrain skin and then draw the feature at its absolute altitude, which 
happen to be underneath the terrain skin.  The feature will not be visible or will be partially 
occluded by the terrain. 

These reasons explain why the use of the AHGT flag should be avoided whenever possible. 

 

A.3.4 When should AHGT be used? 
Limit the use of AHGT to data whose source is inherently absolute.  Such source data 
include geodetic marks or survey marks that provide a known position in terms of latitude, 
longitude, and altitude.  Good examples of such markers are boundary markers between 
countries. 

 

A.4 Guideline: How to Model a Wind Turbine 
This text proposes a way to create a 3D model representing an articulated wind turbine.  The 
articulations of interest are the yaw control to orient the turbine in the direction of the wind, the 
roll control to allow rotation of the rotor, and, optionally, the pitch control to change the 
orientation of the blades, if needed. 

Beside is a typical Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine.  The components of 
interest are the following: 

 Turbine 
 Rotor 
 Blade 

Looking at appendix F – CDB Model Components – we note that Turbine 
is not listed and, consequently, will be proposed for addition to future 
version of the CDB Specification.

Appendix N provides the proper FACC-FSC code for a Wind Turbine, AD010-005.  The code 
indicates the presence of a man-made point feature. 

A = Culture 
D = Power Generator 
010 = Power Plant 
005 = Wind 

The hierarchy graph of the OpenFlight model could look like the 
one on the right.  If individual control of the pitch of each blade 
is required, the Blades object (the lower right node) could be 
replaced with three (3) sub-trees each containing a Blade zone, a 
DOF node, and an object node. 

With the proposed layout, a client device will detect the presence 
of a wind turbine through its FACC, and recognize and control 
two articulations, the Turbine Yaw angle, and Rotor Roll angle. 

A last note: to comply with the prescribed orientation of the 
CDB coordinate system as defined in section 6.3, the rotor must 
represent the front of the wind turbine (and not its right side).

A.5 Guideline: Handling of Model Interiors 
CDB 3.1 introduces the concept of the interior of a 3D model.  The concept is developed in 
section 6.18, Model Interior, of volume 1 of CDB Specification 3.1.  The following text serves as 
a complement to the specification to understand how the concept has been developed and how 
model interior is intended to be used.

A.5.1 Relationship between Model Shell and Model Interior 
The ModelInteriorGeometry dataset is a subordinate dataset of the ‘regular’ ModelGeometry 
dataset.  It depends directly on it.  This is best illustrated by an example. 

 

 

 

LOD ModelGeometry 
(Shell) 

ModelInteriorGeometry 
(Interior) 

… - - 
0 - - 
1 - - 
2 Coarsest Shell - 
3 - - 
4 - - 
5 - - 
6 Medium Shell Medium Interior 
7 - - 
8 Fine Shell Fine Interior 
9 - - 

10 Finest Shell Finest Interior 
11 - - 
12 - - 
13 - - 
14 - - 
15 - - 
… - - 

 

In the above table, the Shell column represents what is called the ‘regular’ ModelGeometry 
dataset.  In this example, the model appears at LOD 2, a better version exists at LOD 6, an even 
better at LOD 8, and finally, the most detailed shell is at LOD 10.  The Interior column shows 3 
different LODs of interiors.  There cannot be more Interior LODs than Shell LODs.  Also, once 
an interior is provided (here at LOD 6), it must be provided for all subsequent (finer) LODs of 
the shell (LOD 8 and 10).  Which means… interior at LOD 8 and 10 must exist. 

 

A.5.2 Detecting Presence of a Model Interior 
It is expected that a client will first request the shell of the model, then discover that the model 
has an interior because of the presence of a CDB Zone whose name is Interior (see 6.18.2, 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0

Pseudo-Interior), and then decide if the pseudo interior is sufficient for the application or if the 
real interior is necessary. 

 

A.5.3 Access of a Model Interior 
Client applications that are interested in 3D models will typically perform the following 
sequence of actions: 

1. Load the GS Features of a tile 
2. Load the GS and GT Models referenced by the GS Features 
3. For each model, traverse its graph and detect the presence of an optional 

Interior (Zone name = Interior) 
4. Decide to load the corresponding Interior (or not) 

Interior datasets exists for both geospecific and geotypical models; hence, all features can be 
represented by a 3D model and all 3D models can have a separately modeled interior.  Note the 
symmetry between the file names of shell and interior datasets.  For geospecific models, the 
names of geometry files are… 

 GeoCell_D300_S001_T001_Lxx_Ux_Rx_FACC_FSC_MODL.flt 
 GeoCell_D305_S001_T001_Lxx_Ux_Rx_FACC_FSC_MODL.flt 

For geotypical models, the file names become… 

 D510_S001_T001_Lxx_FACC_FSC_MODL.flt 
 D515_S001_T001_Lxx_FACC_FSC_MODL.flt 

Note that in both cases, the only difference between the name of the shell and the name of the 
corresponding interior is the dataset code; and in both cases, a value of 5 is added to the 
‘regular’ ModelGeometry dataset code. 

 

A.5.4 UHRB vs CDB Object Models 
To help understand how CDB Model Interior maps to UHRB concepts, three (3) diagrams are 
provided below.  The first two diagrams illustrate the UHRB Object Model1 while the third 
diagram presents the corresponding CDB Object Model. 

The first diagram is the UHRB Class Diagram presented in Figure A-4 below.  The class 
diagram presents twelve classes of which eight are concrete classes that can be used to represent 
tangible objects.  The UHRB_EDM_COMPLEX_FEATURE class implements an extension 
mechanism that is not required in the context of the CDB Specification.  The remaining seven 
UHRB classes will be mapped to CDB zones. 

                                                
1 The two UHRB diagrams presented here come from the document entitled UHRB_2_Object_Model.pdf available 
on the OneSAF web site: www.onesaf.net.

used	  as	  terrain	  elevation	  constraint	  points	  (AHGT	  is	  true)	  into	  a	  non-­‐uniformly	  sampled	  terrain	  
elevation	  dataset.	  	  

The	  application	  of	  a	  constraint	  point	  P	  is	  applied	  as	  follows:	  

1. The	  x,y	  address	  of	   the	  affected	   terrain	  grid	  element	   is	  computed	  by	   truncating	  
the	  lat-­‐long	  coordinates	  of	  point	  P;	  note	  that	  the	  truncation	  operation	  varies	  in	  
accordance	   to	   LOD	   of	   the	   terrain;	   however,	   it	   always	   yields	   grid	   element	  
addresses	  in	  the	  range	  of	  0-­‐1023.	  

2. The	  x,y	  offset	  of	  the	  affected	  terrain	  grid	  element	  is	  computed	  by	  performing	  a

A.8 Guideline: LOD Read Behavior of Subordinate Datasets 
In version 3.1 of the CDB Specification, LOD read behavior of subordinated datasets was 
mentioned only briefly in… 

 Section 5.2.1.2.3 Subordinate Terrain Elevation Components: which stated “The 
CDB Specification does not permit the use of subordinate Terrain Elevation 
component when the primary Terrain Elevation component is not generated.” 

 Section 5.2.1.3.4 Default Read Value: which stated “Simulator client-devices 
should assume … if the data values are not available (files associated with the 
Subordinate Terrain Elevation component for the area covered by a tile, at a given 
LOD or coarser, are either missing or cannot be accessed).

 Section 5.2.1.6 Subordinate Bathymetry Component: which stated “Furthermore, 
since the Bathymetry values are relative to Terrain Elevation component, each 
value in the Bathymetry component must be matched to the finest available LOD 
elevation values of the Terrain Elevation component”. 

 Section 5.2.1.7.3 Default Read Value: which stated “Simulator client-devices 
should assume … if the data values are not available (files associated with the 
Subordinate Terrain Elevation component for the area covered by a tile, at a given 
LOD or coarser, are either missing or cannot be accessed). 

 Section 5.2.2.3.2 Default Read Value: which stated “Simulator client-devices 
should assume … if the data values are not available (files associated with the 
Subordinate Terrain Elevation component for the area covered by a tile, at a given 
LOD or coarser, are either missing or cannot be accessed). 
 

This guideline provides clarification on the client-device LOD read behavior of subordinated 
datasets; it describes the mandated behavior of a simulator client-device when reading a LOD of 
a Primary Elevation Component and combining it with another LOD of a Subordinate Terrain 
Elevation Component 

Consider the case where a simulator client-device is attempting to read CDB data for a given 
region of the CDB at LOD = p.  The CDB region has a Primary Elevation Component populated 
with data ranging from LOD = -10 to LOD = m, and a Subordinate Elevation Component 
populated with data ranging from LOD = -10 to LOD = n. 

 

The required client-device read behavior is illustrated in Figure A-13 below, and can be 
summarized as follows: 

 For -10 ≤ p ≤ m, the client-device accesses the primary elevation data at LOD = p. 

 For p > m ≥ -10, the client-device accesses the primary elevation data at LOD = 
m. 

 For -10 ≤ p ≤ n, the client-device accesses the subordinate elevation data at LOD 
= p. 

 For p > n ≥ -10, the client-device accesses the primary elevation data at LOD = n. 

 For p > m and p < n and m < n, the client-device interpolates the primary 
elevation data from LOD = m to LOD = p before combining it with the 
subordinate elevation data of LOD = p. 

 For p > m and p > n and m < n, the client-device interpolates the primary 
elevation data from LOD = m to LOD = n before combining it with the 
subordinate elevation data of LOD = n.

 For p < m and p > n and m > n, the client-device interpolates the subordinate 
elevation data from LOD = n to LOD = p before combining it with the primary 
elevation data of LOD = p. 

 For p > m and p > n and m > n, the client-device interpolates the subordinate 
elevation data from LOD = n to LOD = m before combining it with the primary 
elevation data of LOD = m. 

 For n = φ (unavailable) and p > m ≥ -10, the client-device accesses the default 
value in Defaults.xml for the subordinate elevation data. 

 The combination of (m = φ (unavailable) and n ≥ -10), is not permitted, i.e., the 
generation of Subordinate Terrain Elevation LODs is not permitted if the Primary 
Terrain Elevation component have not been generated. 

 If the default value for the Primary Elevation dataset is unavailable in 
Defaults.xml, or if Defaults.xml file is missing, then the client-device must revert 
to the client-device’s internal default value for this dataset. 

 If the default value for the Subordinate Elevation dataset is unavailable in 
Defaults.xml, or if Defaults.xml file is missing, then the client-device must revert 
to the client-device’s internal default value for this dataset.

The default value for the Primary Terrain Elevation component is the constant 
Primary_Elevation, which can be found in \CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml.  The CDB 
Specification recommends that the value for Primary_Elevation = 0.  In the case where the 
default value cannot be found within the Defaults.xml file, or that the Defaults.xml file cannot be 
found, the CDB Specification recommends that client-devices internally generate a default value 
of Primary_Elevation = 0. 

The default values for the Subordinate Terrain Elevation layer “n” (where “n” is the subordinate 
elevation layer number, e.g., a value from 2 to 99) is the constant Subordinate_Elevation-n, 
which can be found in \CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml.  The CDB Specification recommends that 
the value for Subordinate_Elevation-n = 0.  In the case where the default value cannot be found 
within the Defaults.xml file, or that the Defaults.xml file cannot be found, the CDB Specification 
recommends that client-devices internally generate a default value of Subordinate_Elevation-n = 
0. 

The CDB Specification does not permit the use of Subordinate Terrain Elevation components 
when the Primary Terrain Elevation component is not generated. 

A.9 Clarification: Publisher Considerations 
The CDB specification does not provide guidelines regarding its implementation within vendor 
SE toolsets and vendor simulation architectures.  This clearly falls outside of the CDB 
specification mandate.  Like other standards such as SIF and SEDRIS, the CDB Specification is 
solely a data schema for Synthetic Environmental information (i.e., it merely describes data) for 
use in simulation. 

However, unlike SIF and SEDRIS, the CDB data schema lends itself to a real-time 
implementation within simulation architectures.  As a result of this greater capability, many 
vendors have opted to achieve real-time capability with the CDB (CDB used as a runtime 
repository).  This capability requires that the vendor’s client-device be adapted with a Run-Time 
publishing (RTP) software function which transforms the CDB data into the client-device’s 
internal legacy/proprietary format. This is a new concept for the simulation industry and 
consequently there is considerable confusion regarding the implementation of Off-line and Run-
time Publishers (RTPs).  While much of the attention has focused on RTPs, a similar set of 
considerations apply to the implementation of an off-line CDB capability (CDB is used as a 
Refined Source Data Repository).  In this latter case, the capability requires that the vendor 
develop an off-line CDB import function which ingests the CDB into his Synthetic Environment 
Creation toolset; once imported, the toolset produces (as always) the vendor’s proprietary data 
format through an off-line compilation function. 

By definition, the function of an RTP is to bridge the “gap” (or adapt) between CDB data schema 
and the client-device’s internal (proprietary) data schema.  Since this gap is unknown, it is 
impossible in this addendum to provide hard-and-fast rules and detailed estimates for the 
implementation of an RTP (or a CDB import function).

Note that there are many alternatives open to a vendor when considering the level of compliancy 
he wishes to achieve.  The level-of-effort is essentially a function of the level-of-compliancy the 
vendor wishes to achieve, and the size of the intrinsic “gap” between the CDB data schema and 
his device’s internal schema. 

Nonetheless, this section highlights aspects of the CDB that are particularly significant when 
considering such implementations. These aspects dominate the level-of-effort required to achieve 
ideal CDB compliancy. 

The CDB Specification limits itself to a description of a data schema for Synthetic 
Environmental information (i.e. it merely describes data) for use in simulation.  The CDB 
specification provides a rigorous definition of the semantic meaning for each dataset, each 
attribute and establishes the structure/organization of that data as a schema comprised of a folder 
hierarchy and files with internal (industry-standard) formats. This ensures that the all CDB data 
is understood, interpreted and efficiently accessed in the same way by each client-device. The 
CDB specification does not include detailed guidelines regarding off-line database compliers or 
run-time publisher implementations, since this would be tantamount to dictating internal vendor 
formats which are by their very nature proprietary. 

 

 The CDB Specification is solely a data schema for Synthetic Environmental 
information (i.e. it merely describes data) for use in simulation. Given this 
mandate, it is entirely platform independent, i.e. it does NOT provide the 
implementation details of specific off-line database compilers or runtime 
publishers attached to specific client-devices. 

 

As a result the CDB specification DOES NOT provide: 

 The implementation details of an off-line CDB import function that can then be 
used to compile the imported Synthetic Environmental data into one or more types 
of proprietary runtime databases (only the client-device vendor has this 
knowledge and control) 

 The implementation details or algorithms of runtime publishers attached to 
specific client-device (only the client-device vendor has this knowledge and 
control) 

 The implementation details or algorithms of client-devices that use CDB data 
(only the client-device vendor has this knowledge and control)

 While the CDB specification does not govern the actual implementation of 
client-devices, it is expected that the CDB specification will have a “unifying” 
effect on the implementation of each vendor’s client-device by virtue of the fact 
that they will share the exact same Synthetic Environmental data.  It is expected 
that side-by-side comparisons will be easier to undertake due to the fact that 
devices will run off the exact same runtime data.  Prior to the advent of the CDB 
specification, side-by-side comparisons were considerably more difficult to 
undertake due to the fact the entire SE creation chain starting from raw source 
was implicated in such evaluations. 

 

If we set aside legacy considerations, the simplest approach to adopting the CDB would require 
that client-devices ingest the CDB natively, i.e., client-devices would handle all of the CDB data 
schema/semantics without any off-line or run-time intermediary. 

In practice however, most vendors have extensive legacy SE assets and cannot afford to 
obsolesce these.  As a result, most client-devices must continue to support their own proprietary 
legacy runtime databases.  Given these considerations, two solutions are possible: 

a) No change to the Client-device:  In this approach, vendors have chosen to 
achieve an off-line CDB capability (CDB is used as a Refined Source Data 
Repository).  This capability requires that the vendor develops an off-line 
CDB import function which ingests the CDB into his Synthetic Environment 
Creation toolset; once imported, the toolset produces (as always) the vendor’s 
proprietary data format through an off-line compilation function. 

b)  Insertion of a Runtime Publisher:  In this approach, vendors have opted to 
achieve real-time capability with the CDB (CDB is used as a runtime 
repository).  This capability requires that the vendor’s client-device be 
adapted with a Run-Time publishing (RTP) software function which 
transforms the CDB data into the client-device’s internal legacy/proprietary 
format. 

 

A.9.1 Level-of-Effort of a Publisher Implementation 
The following discussion attempts to qualify the level-of-effort to achieve CDB compliancy.  
The discussion applies equally to both paradigms, i.e., the CDB Runtime Publishing paradigm 
and the CDB import-then-compile paradigm. 

In the case where a client-device already supports most of data schema and semantics concepts 
of the CDB, then the RTP (or import-then-compile) software is proportionally less complex.  For 
instance, if an IG already supports the concepts of tiles, of levels-of-detail, of layers and 
understands the concepts of datasets such as terrain texture, gridded terrain elevation, gridded 
terrain materials, etc. then there is a modest amount of work to be performed by an RTP. 

 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014

 The level-of-effort in adopting the CDB data schema is proportion to the 
difference between the CDB data schema and client-device’s internal 
proprietary data schema. 

 

Clearly, the algorithmic complexity of an RTP and the computational load imposed on the RTP 
is directly proportional to the above-mentioned “gap”.  The larger the “gap”, the more expensive 
a RTP is to develop and the more computational resources need to be allocated to implement it.  
Conversely, with a smaller “gap”, the RTP development is straightforward and relatively few 
computational resources need to be allocated to this function. 

In order to assess the level-of-effort to adopt the CDB schema, the vendor must first evaluate the 
similarity of data schemas between the CDB and his client-device, in particular, he must assess 
whether he espouses the following fundamental CDB concepts: 

v Independent Tiles (used for paging of all SE data) 
v Independent Levels-of-Detail (for all SE data) 
v Independent Layers (Dataset Layering) 
v Following dataset concepts and semantics: 

Ø Semantic understanding of all CDB layers 
Ø Geo-gridded data layers consisting of terrain altimetry, terrain texture, terrain 

materials/mixtures 

Ø Geo-defined vector features (points, lineals, areals) 

 With/without modeled 3D representations 

 Feature attribution 
Ø 3D Modeled representation of features (using a data schema similar to or 

equivalent to OpenFlight) 

 Instanced geotypical models 

 Instanced model geometry  

 Instanced model texture 

 Non-instanced geospecific models 
Ø Conforming of features to terrain skin (e.g. height conforming) 
Ø Topological networks 
Ø JPEG-2K compression 
Ø Generation of device-specific NVG/FLIR rendering parameters for light-

points and materials

 In the case where a client-device does not intrinsically support one or more of 
the above-mentioned CDB concepts, the RTP must perform SE conversions 
that will likely fall beyond those of mere format/structure manipulations. Such 
conversions may affect the precision of the data, its semantic meaning, etc, and 
thus can compromise certain aspects of runtime correlation. 

 

The CDB data schema favors modern up-to-date implementations of client-devices.  In effect, 
the level-of-effort to develop an RTP for an obsolete legacy device is likely to be greater than for 
a modern device.  This is because early approaches in digital computer based flight simulation 
were more severely constrained by severe hardware, software and data source limitations. 
Consequently, simulation engineers made important compromises between a subsystem’s 
targeted fidelity and its level of generality, scalability, abstraction, and correlation with other 
simulator client-devices.  In many cases, engineers reverted to complex support data structures 
(generated off-line) in order to reduce the computational load at runtime. 

 A classic example of this was the use of Binary Separation Planes (BSPs) data structures2  
which were required prior to the widespread adoption of Z-buffers by the IG vendors. The CDB 
specification does not make provisions for this and as such, the RTP for legacy BSP-based IG 
devices would be burdened with the rather difficult task to generate BSPs in real-time. 

Given their tremendous benefit, the concepts of database paging (e.g. tiles) and levels-of-details 
have steadily been adopted by simulation vendors over the past 15-20 years and have been 
applied to most datasets, notably terrain and imagery datasets. (See Appendix “A” of the CDB 
Specification for a rationale for Tiles and Levels-of-detail). As a result, it is not expected that the 
CDB tiles and LOD concepts will be a problem for most vendors.  Note however that CDB 
applies these two concepts to ALL dataset layers including vector features and 3D models. 

 

A.9.2 Typical Functions Performed by a Publisher Implementation 
The following discussion provides a typical list of software functions that must be developed in 
order to achieve CDB compliancy.  The discussion applies equally to both paradigms, i.e. the 
CDB Runtime Publishing paradigm and the CDB import-then-compile paradigm. 

Virtually all simulation client-devices in existence today natively ingest their own proprietary 
native runtime formats.  In order to ingest CDB directly, vendors must adapt the device’s 
software to natively ingest the CDB format (e.g. TIFF, Shape, OpenFlight, etc.) or alternately, he 
can insert a runtime publisher function that transforms the CDB data formats into legacy client 
device’s native runtime format.  The runtime publishing process is performed when the CDB is 
paged-in from the CDB storage device. 

                                                
2 Such BSP data structures where required by most IG vendors prior to ~1995 due to the fact that the IGs did not 
have sub-pixel level Z-buffer capability.

The runtime publishers are nothing more than well-optimized offline database publishers capable 
of responding to the on-demand compilation of datasets as they are being paged-in by the 
respective client devices.  The function of a runtime publisher is no different than that of a 
conventional offline database publisher, i.e., it… 

a) transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s 
internal data structure and format 

b) transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s 
internal naming conventions 

c) transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s 
number precision and number representation 

d) transforms the assembled database into parameters compatible with the client 
device’s internal algorithms (typically light parameters, FLIR/NVG 
parameters, etc. 

e) transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s data 
fidelity requirements 

f) transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s 
performance and internal memory limitations 

g) transforms the assembled database so that it satisfies the client-device’s level 
of-detail representation requirements. 

 

 Ideally, the scope of an RTP should be purely limited to manipulations of data 
format and data structure and internal naming conventions (items 1-7 above). 
Under such circumstances, it is possible to achieve perfect runtime correlation 
between client-devices. 

 

A.9.3 Publisher Implementation Recommendations 
The use of the CDB data schema “as-is” by a client-device achieves all of the benefits stated in 
sections 1.4 and 1.5 of the CDB specification, namely: 

a) Improved SE generation timeline and deployment 
b) Interoperable simulation-ready SE 
c) Improved client-device robustness/determinism 
d) Increase SE longevity 
e) Reduced SE storage infrastructure cost 
f) Platform independence and scalability 
g) SE scalability and adaptability

In the case where a client-device does not adhere to one or more of the above-mentioned 
“fundamental CDB concepts”, fewer of the CDB benefits will be realizable. 

For instance, a client-device incapable of dealing with levels-of-detail will not have the same 
level SE scalability (a benefit explained in section 1.4.7 of the CDB specification) as one that 
fully espouses that concept.  While the latter may be acceptable, it is clearly a less-compliant and 
an inferior implementation of the CDB than the former. 

Changes to the modeled representation of features are generally not advisable since it invariably 
affects the accuracy of the modeled representation. Most image generators in use today can 
ingest  a (one-for-one correspondence) the CDB modeled polygonal representation of 3D 
features.  However, in the case of terrain, there are two dominant approaches in industry, either a 
regular grid with LODs or alternately, the Terrain Irregular Network (TIN) mesh.   The CDB 
specification has opted for the former given its greater scalability, determinism and compatibility 
with tiling schemes.  Clearly, implementations where such conversions are not necessary are 
advantaged and provide more of the above-mentioned CDB benefits. 

Furthermore, the CDB is designed to provide both the semantic (e.g. vector data/attribution) and 
the modeled representation of features.  Since the CDB specification provides both, it is not 
advisable to ignore or replace the modeled representation (if provided) nor is it advisable to 
synthesize a non-CDB modeled representation if none was supplied within the CDB.  While the 
CDB specification does not forbid vendors to interpret CDB feature data for the purpose of 
procedurally synthesizing more detailed feature data or synthesizing modeled data from the 
feature data, this practice is not recommended as this would severely compromise correlation 
and inter-operability.  In the context of correlated synthetic environments, such approaches are 
viable if and only if all client-devices in a federation are equipped with the exact same 
procedural algorithms.   Currently, this is not possible because there are no industry-standard, 
open-source procedural algorithms endorsed by all simulation vendors. 

 In the case of the CDB Runtime Publishing paradigm and the CDB import-then-
compile paradigm, it is not advisable to ignore or replace the modeled 
representation (if provided) nor is it advisable to synthesize a non-CDB modeled 
representation if none was supplied within the CDB. 

 

A.10 Rationale: Sensor Simulation - Achieving Device-Independence 
One of the primary objectives of this Specification is to provide and integrate all of the data 
required by all sensor devices, not just Image Generators producing the OTW scenes.  The 
purpose of this integration, among other things, is to achieve and maintain a high level of 
correlation among the many client-devices (subsystems) within a simulator.  Furthermore, this 
integration must be done independently of the client-device or the sensor type, with little or no 
duplication of data amongst clients.  In addition to the OTW, many simulator client-devices are 
required to simulate the synthetic environment over different portions of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, infrared (e.g. FLIR, NVG), microwaves (e.g. radar), audio (e.g. sonar), etc.  Up to 
now, the current state of the art approaches to the simulation of sensors has typically been quite

proprietary to the client-device implementation of the various vendors.  There have been no 
universally accepted simulation models suitable for use in simulation. 

Sensor simulation typically requires a simulation of the device itself, supplemented by a 
complete simulation of the synthetic environment over the portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum that is relevant to this device.  The former simulation is referred to as the Sensor 
Simulation Model (SSM) while the latter is called the Sensor Environmental Model (SEM).  In 
the past, the SEM relied heavily on environmental database whose content was designed to 
match the functionality, fidelity, structure and format requirements of the SEM.  The level of 
realism possible by the SEM depended heavily on the quality, quantity and completeness of the 
data available.  The environmental database was highly device-specific and could not be readily 
ported to other platforms. 

A SEM is usually based on mathematical model of the environment for the portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum of interest.  The SEM acts much as a black box that produces a 
response in accordance to input data.  A significant portion of this data must come from the 
CDB; however, the key is to segregate all device-dependent data and all SEM-dependent data 
from the modeling data that represents the synthetic environment.  In order to accommodate the 
most different kind of sensors possible, a common denominator must be chosen.  In the CDB 
specification, this common denominator is called a material.  This is the subject of this chapter. 

One of the fundamental issues of sensor simulation involves the handling of material properties.  
As discussed earlier, the determination of which material properties should be supported heavily 
depends on: 

a) the sensor types to be supported. 
b) the vendors’ sensor simulation implementations to be supported. 
c) the level of fidelity, functionality and precision of the SEMs to be supported. 

 

Clearly, the task of determining a definitive list of material properties that would accommodate 
all of the above requirements for the today’s sensor types, vendor implementations and SEMs 
would be a significant challenge.  Furthermore, once released, the materials properties would 
limit any SEM innovation by the industry.  As a result, the CDB specification limits its 
jurisdiction over the material properties. 

Instead, the CDB specification defines and publicly defines a list of materials that can be used in 
a CDB.  It is the responsibility of each vendor to define the properties (that satisfies the sensor 
type) for these CDB materials.  As a result, vendors are totally free to select material properties 
that satisfy the fidelity, functionality and precision requirements of the SEM for the sensor type 
of interest.  Alternately, if the vendors have their own list of materials, they can create a mapping 
between CDB materials and their internally supported list of materials.  This approach allows 
client-devices to retain their SEMs as well as their own sets of material properties. 

The next section describes how materials are defined and modeled within a CDB.

A.11 Rationale: Partitioning the Earth into Tiles 
This section provides rationale for partitioning the world into tiles. 

The design of the CDB specification tile representation is centered on three primary 
considerations: 

(1) A tile representation comprehensive enough to accommodate the entire earth. 
(2) A tile representation that lends itself to real-time implementation by a CDB 

system and all of its attached simulator client-devices. 
 

A numerically straightforward mapping (such as a simple scaling) to map lat-
long coordinates into CDB coordinates and vice versa is highly desirable for 
real-time implementation considerations. 

 

(3) A tile representation with a system of units that conforms as much as possible 
to geographic standards. 
One of the underlying motivations driving the CDB tile representation is the 
need for a system that will remain as close to the raw source data as possible 
which currently is DTED and GeoTIFF; DTED uses a geographic coordinate 
system defined by latitudes and longitudes.  The basic unit in DTED is a geo-
cell, which always has a height and width of one degree.  In order to maintain 
a density of data that does not increase inordinately when moving towards the 
poles, the grid post intervals (measured in degrees or arc-sec) along the 
longitudinal axis are increased at specific latitudes; for instance, at DTED 
level 2, the latitude interval is always one second of arc but the longitude 
interval is one second of arc at latitudes from 0 to 50 degrees, from latitudes 
50 to 70 the interval is two arc seconds and so on as shown in Table A-3.

Before going into the detailed design of the CDB tile representation, it is worth stating the 
guiding principles that constrain the approach used by the CDB tile representation: 

 

(1) The earth model is divided (in latitude) into slices. 
 

(2) The slice’s x-axis is aligned to WGS-84 lines of latitude. 
 

(3) The slice’s y-axis is aligned to WGS-84 lines of longitude. 
 

(4) The number of units along the slice’s y-axis for a given level of detail is the 
same for all slices. 

 

The earth surface geodetic dimension in arc-second of y-axis units within an 
earth slice and in all earth slices is exactly the same, regardless of latitude. 

 

(5) The geodetic dimension of an x-axis unit in arc-second is constant within a 
zone, but is re-defined at pre-selected latitudes to achieve a greater level of 
spatial sampling uniformity in all tiles; this overcomes the narrowing effect of 
increased latitudes on longitudinal distances.  The definition of zones in the 
CDB is the same as those in DTED (with the exception of the poles). 

  

(6) The number of units along the slice’s x-axis for a given level of detail is the 
same within each zone. 

 

(7) The number of units along the slice’s y-axis is constrained to a 2n-multiple in 
all slices. 

 

Many simulator client devices impose constraints related to the run-time use 
of binary pyramidal structures (such as mip-maps, quadtrees, etc.).  A binary 
pyramidal structure is simply a collection of two-dimensional arrays; each 
array represents the same content but at successively finer levels of resolution.

(8) The number of units along the slice’s x-axis will vary depending on which 
zone the latitude of the slice belongs.  At this point we introduce the concept 
of a CDBGeocell, which differs slightly from a DTED Geocell.  A DTED cell 
is always 1 × 1 degrees.  In contrast, a CDBGeocell always has a height of 
1 degree but has a varying width depending on its latitude.  Table A-4.  Size 
of CDB Geocell per zone shows the dimensions of a CDBGeocell per zones 
of latitude.  For instance, in latitude zone 5, which goes from –50 to 50 
degrees latitude, a CDBGeocell is 1 × 1 degree, in zone 4 and 6 which goes 
from latitude 50 to 70 degrees the cell size is 1 × 2 degrees.  The main reason 
to introduce this concept is to maintain a reasonable eccentricity between the 
sides by trying to keep them as close to a square as possible.  Two criteria are 
used to define the size of a CDB Geocell: 

 

(a) A CDBGeocell must contain a whole number of DTED Geocells; in other 
words a CDBGeocell must start and end on a whole degree along the 
longitudinal axis.  This is done so as to facilitate mapping from 
CDBGeocells to DTED Geocells. 

 

(b) The length of the CDBGeocell must be a whole factor of 180, in other 
words length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 degrees are legal but lengths of 7 and 8 
degrees would not be since these are not exact factors of 180.

The variable CDBGeocell size in the CDB specification has the following benefit:

(a) Reduces the simulator client processing overheads associated with the 
switching from one zone to another.  (Due to the small number of zones 
across the earth.) 

 

(b) Reduces the variation of longitudinal dimensions (in meters) to a 
maximum of 50%. 

 

(c) Improves storage efficiency. 
 

A.12 Rationale: Importance of Level-of-Details 
The availability of LODs for most datasets is critical for real-time performance.  Many simulator 
client-devices can readily take advantage of an LOD structure because many clients naturally 
require less detail with increasing distance away from the simulated ownship position.  For 
example, the projection of screen pixels (i.e. pixels in an IG image plane) onto near-field terrain 
subtends much less area than the projection of screen pixel onto far-field terrain near the horizon; 
as a result, much less detail is required at far range.  In addition, clients may need to revert to an 
alternate coarser representation if they cannot cope with the paging bandwidths, memory 
footprint or computational requirements of finer LODs.  This provides a solid basis on which 
client-devices can build paging managers, load management and memory management 
algorithms. 

The following example illustrates the important performance considerations and the inherent 
performance advantage that can be achieved with an LOD structure.  Consider a simulator client-
device, with a capability to display terrain imagery out to 128 km; the imagery is 1m at its finest 
available resolution and the simulated ownship is flying at 100 m/s.  Under these conditions, and 
without the benefit of an LOD organization (as illustrated in Figure A-15: Paging of Terrain 
Imagery without an LOD Structure), the client-device would require access to the imagery at a 
rate of ~100 Mpixels/sec.  Consider on the other hand the same operating conditions but with the 
client-device accessing LOD-organized imagery (as illustrated in Figure A-14: Paging of Terrain 
Imagery with an LOD Structure).  Furthermore, assume that the client-device only requires 1m 
imagery for ranges less than 1/2 km, 2m for ranges less than 1km, 4m for ranges less than 2km, 
and so on.  With the benefit of an LOD structure, the client-device would require access to the 
imagery at a much lower rate of ~1 Mpixels/sec, reducing access bandwidth by a factor of ~100x 
over the non-LOD approach.  Clearly, such performance gains cannot be ignored for real-time 
applications such as flight simulators, especially when one realizes that access bandwidth 
increases as the square of the imagery resolution. 

In addition to a reduction in access bandwidth, the LOD structure also benefits simulator client-
devices that have a requirement to dynamically filter the data to control aliasing.  In effect, part 
of the client-device filtering process is relegated to an off-line process. 

The CDB specification does not enforce, nor does it specify the type of filter used to compute the 
data element values of raster-organized or list-organized datasets.  Yet, it is clear that inadequate

off-line filter may affect the rendering quality of the affected client-devices.  As a result, the 
CDB specification provides guidelines to govern the quality of the off-line LOD process; these 
guidelines are provided with each of the raster-organized dataset (or list-organized datasets in 
future releases of the CDB specification).

A.13 Primer: Line-of-Sight Algorithms Using MinElevation and MaxElevation 
Components 

The purpose of the MinElevation and MaxElevation components is to provide the CDB with the 
necessary data and structure to achieve the required level of determinism in the computation line-
of-sight calculations with the terrain.  The values of each component are with respect to mean 
sea level.  Since both the MinElevation and the MaxElevation values are provided by this 
Specification, any line-of-sight algorithm can rapidly assess an intersection status of the line-of-
sight vector with the terrain. 

 

There are three cases to consider:  

 

1. CASE 1 – No intersection:  If all of the LOS Bounding Boxes are above the 
MinMax Bounding Boxes, then there is no intersection between the line-of-
sight vector and the terrain.  No further testing is required.  (Refer to Figure 
A-16: Case 1 – No Intersection.)

Figure A-16: Case 1 – No Intersection 

 

2. CASE 2 – Potential intersection:  If one or more of the LOS Bounding 
Boxes overlap with a MinMax Bounding Box, then there is a potential 
intersection between the line-of-sight vector and the terrain.  This step must be 
repeated with progressively finer level-of-detail versions of the MinElevation 
and MaxElevation values until Case 1 or Case 3 is encountered.  If the finest 
level-of-detail is reached and the LOS result still yields a potential intersection 
status (Case 2), then the LOS algorithm must perform a LOS intersection with 
the finest LOD of the Primary Terrain Elevation component using the 
prescribed CDB meshing convention.  (Refer to Figure A-17: Case 2 – 
Potential Intersection.)

3. CASE 3 – Intersection:  If one or more of the LOS Bounding Boxes are 
below the MinMax Bounding Boxes, then there is an intersection between the 
line-of-sight vector and the terrain.  No further testing is required to determine 
whether there is intersection or not.  (Refer to Figure A-18: Case 3 – 
Guaranteed Intersection.)  However, to determine the intersection point, the 
LOS algorithm must perform the following additional steps.  If (starting with 
the LOS point-of-origin) one or more of the LOS Bounding Boxes overlap 
with a MinMax Bounding Boxes, then there is a potential intersection between 
the line-of-sight vector and the terrain for that MinMax Bounding Box.  This 
step must be repeated with progressively finer level-of-detail versions of the 
MinElevation and MaxElevation values until Case 1 or Case 3 is encountered.  
If the finest level-of-detail is reached and the LOS result still yields a potential 
intersection status (Case 2), then the LOS algorithm must perform a LOS 
intersection with the finest LOD of the Primary Terrain Elevation component 
using the prescribed CDB meshing convention.

A.14 Primer: Radar Cross Sections (RCS) 
This section provides technical description of the RCS data and its usage in real-time simulation. 

 

The Radar Cross-Section (RCS) of a target is a measure of the radar reflection characteristics of 
a target (usually expressed in m2, dBsm, or volts).  It is equal to the power reflected back to the 
radar divided by power density of the wave striking the target.  For most targets, the radar cross-
section corresponds to the area of the cross section of the sphere that would reflect the same 
energy back to the radar, if a metal sphere were substituted.  A sphere is sometimes used since 
the RCS of a sphere is independent of frequency if operating in the far field region of the radar.  
(Reference [24]) 

 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014 
 

 
45

The RCS data unit of measure for the intensity are usually referenced as a normalized ratio in 
Decibels relative to a square meter (reference [25]), or otherwise known as dBsm.  Another data 
measure that is linked to the intensity measure is also the ‘phase shift’ angle (in degrees) of the 
returned energy.  It can provide some additional information about the reflective attributes of the 
elements reflecting back to the radar. 

 

However, the RCS defines the echo at the radar for the model (target) in question, which varies 
considerably depending on the target’s orientation, its relative distance and size with respect to 
the simulated radar’s antenna.  The viewing angles are shown in the diagram below. 

 

 
Figure A-19: Relative Azimuth (α) and Elevation (φ) Angles 

 

RCS curves are normally produced using highly specialized off-line tools which input the model 
geometry and material attributes (typically an OpenFlight file) and applies physics-based 
processing like geometric ray-tracing, optical reflections/refractions, corner detection, material 
absorption and so on to the geometric data representation of the model.  This processing is 
computationally expensive and is usually performed in non real-time.  The end-result of this 
computation (usually 2D arrays of data points in elevation and azimuth) provides data that can be 
used more efficiently by simulation modeling such as radar at run-time.  Those data curves are 
stored in a polar-type representation table, which provide specific reflectivity levels given a set 
of azimuth and elevation aspect angles. 

A.14.1 Functional Description 
To simulate a target for most modes of operation, the Radar software uses an RCS Polar 
Diagram as shown below:

Figure A-20: Polar Diagram of RCS data in Decibels at a given elevation angle 

 

The polar diagram allows the radar to use an RCS value array (indexed by azimuth/elevation 
angles) for getting an approximation of the overall RCS of distant targets.  The approximated 
RCS data is a function of the model’s materials, geometry, view angles, and multi-paths 
reflections generated within the model itself. 

 

It can also be depicted more linearly as shown in the following diagram: 

 
Figure A-21: Linear Diagram of RCS data in Decibels at a given elevation angle 

 

As it can be seen in the example above, relative intensities are much greater when viewing the 
model directly in front (0° azimuth), from the back (±180° azimuth) and on the sides (-90° and 
+90° azimuth).

The RCS data is often characterized by its data resolution and physical modeling parameters.  
The data resolution determines the angular increments between successive RCS values, and 
modeling parameters specify the attributes of the physical parameters used to drive the RCS 
mathematical model computations (such as the Electro-Magnetic properties of the simulated 
electric field). 

 

Both wavelength and polarization affect how a radar system “sees” the elements in the scene.  
Therefore, radar using different polarization and wavelength combinations may provide different 
and complementary information, which can be used to enhance the radar image in a specific 
way. 

A.14.2 Wave Polarization 
When computing an RCS model, it is important to consider microwave energy propagation and 
scattering, and also the polarization of the radiation, which is an important property.  For a plane 
electromagnetic (EM) wave, polarization refers to the locus of the electric field vector in the 
plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation.  The length of the vector represents the 
amplitude of the wave, and the rotation rate of the vector represents the frequency of the wave.  
Polarization refers to the orientation and shape of the pattern traced by the tip of the vector. 
(Reference [23]) 

 

 
Figure A-22: Horizontal and Vertical Polarization of a plane of EM wave 

 

The waveform of the electric field strength (voltage) of an EM wave can be predictable (the 
wave is polarized) or random (the wave is un-polarized), or a combination of both. In the latter 
case, the degree of polarization describes the ratio of polarized power to total power of the wave.  
An example of a fully polarized wave would be a monochromatic sine wave, with a single, 
constant frequency and stable amplitude.

Many types of radar antennae are designed to transmit and/or receive microwave radiation that is 
either horizontally (H) or vertically (V) polarized, or a combination of both.  A transmitted wave 
of either polarization can generate a backscattered wave with a variety of polarizations, thus an 
equal amount of resulting RCS curves. 

 

Polarization type on either transmission or reception mode can be synthesized by using H and V 
components, with a well-defined relationship between them. For this reason, systems that 
transmit and receive both of these linear polarizations are commonly used.  With these radars, 
there can be four combinations of transmit and receive polarizations: 

 

HH - for horizontal transmit and horizontal receive 

VV - for vertical transmit and vertical receive 

HV - for horizontal transmit and vertical receive, and 

VH - for vertical transmit and horizontal receive. 

 

The first two polarization combinations are referred to as “like-polarized” because transmit and 
receive polarization types are the same.  The last two combinations are referred to as “cross-
polarized” because transmit and receive polarizations are orthogonal to one another. 

Radar systems can have one, two, or all four of these transmit/receive polarization combinations.  
Examples include the following types of radar systems: 

 

Single polarized HH or VV (or possibly HV or VH) 
Dual polarized HH and HV, VV and VH, or HH and VV 
Alternating polarization HH and HV, alternating with VV and VH 
Polarimetric HH, VV, HV, and VH 

 

Both wavelength and polarization affect how a radar system “sees” the elements in the scene.  
Therefore, radar using different polarization and wavelength combinations may provide different 
and complementary information, which can be used to enhance the radar image in a specific 
way.

Therefore, polarization information is an important part of the CDB’s RCS Data representation. 

 

A.14.3 Wave Parameters 
In addition to the wave polarization explained above, other physical parameters of the modeled 
electromagnetic wave are also a contributing factor to the RCS of a target when seen by Radar.  
Therefore those parameters are available in conjunction with the RCS data curves: 

 

Those parameters are generally as follows: 

 

- Radar Mode (Continuous wave or Pulsed) 
- Radiating Frequency 
- Antenna Main Lobe Gain 
- Antenna Main Lobe Bandwidth 
- Antenna Side Lobe 3dB point 
- Radar Pulse width (if pulsed radar mode) 
- Radar Pulse Repetition Frequency (if pulsed radar mode) 
-  

A.15 Information: Tide Simulation Modeling Alternatives 
The availability of a Tide component permits realistic simulation of tides with a minimal 
computational overhead by the simulation application.  Furthermore, the Tide component also 
permits simulation of tides whose amplitude varies differently with location.  In order to 
determine the shoreline profile at a given location, the simulator client-devices must first 
determine the height of (say) the ocean in the immediate vicinity of that location.  The 
sophistication of this calculation can vary greatly with simulation fidelity. 

 

Figure A-23: Examples of Ocean Tide Simulation Fidelity in Simulator, illustrates examples of 
how tide simulation might be handled.  At the low-end of the fidelity spectrum, the tide level 
(expressed as a value between –100% (average low tide) and 100% (average high tide) could be 
provided directly at the simulator’s control console.  In a high-end simulation, one could develop 
a simulation of the earth’s oceans that takes into account Bathymetry profile of the oceans and 
the ephemeris model (particularly moon and sun) as a function of time and date.  Regardless of 
simulation fidelity, the CDB internal representation facilitates the work of simulation client 
devices that are interested in obtaining the shoreline profile and ocean heights.

A.16 Information: Comparison of CDB to FalconView Structure 
While the CDB file naming convention and its directory structure are somewhat different from 
that used in FalconView, it is possible to find equivalent files between the two. 

The FalconView directory structure contains some metadata describing its content and area 
coverage; it has a three level directory structure.  The first level “rpf” is a raster product format: 
the second level being the dataset such as “gnc” (global navigation chart): and the third level 
relates to the zones; all files are under the third level.  The file name is eight characters long 
followed by a three-character file extension, and the file name portion uses a radix 34 numbering 
notation that is based on the position of the frame in the zone as well as revision info and the 
producer ID key.  The file extension is based on the dataset and the zone.  Note that frames are 
equivalent to CDB tiles. 

From information such as a given lat/lon, a given resolution such as one-meter pixel size and the 
dataset such as global navigation chart, it is possible to generate the corresponding FalconView 
file name and its path.  Similarly, given a lat/lon, an LOD and a dataset it is possible to generate 
a CDB file name and its path.  Though not identical in coverage and resolution these two files 
should be similar in content for the same dataset. 

Note that when given a CDB file name, it is possible to extract the tile position in lat/lon, the 
dataset it belongs to, and the LOD, even its full path name, i.e. the file name is unique for the

entire CDB.  This is not the case for FalconView.  Since the resolution is not implicit in the 
name, the file itself must be read to extract this information; the dataset and zone info can be 
extracted from the file extension.  Also note that directories in FalconView can potentially be 
very large since all files in a zone reside in the same directory; this is especially true for fine 
resolutions. 

The FalconView directory structure follows the guidelines and conventions specified by MIL-
STD-2411. 

The algorithms used to find file name are given by examples within the MIL-C-89041 Controlled 
Image Base (CIB) document; in that document, zones are shown as overlapping.  Note that this 
may not reflect the manner in which FalconView was implemented; nonetheless this does not 
affect the methodology provided in this section. 

 

A.16.1 FalconView Directory structure 
In FalconView, a top-level directory contains files that are metadata containing information 
about the various datasets and files in the directories.   

The FalconView directory structure is as follows:

A.16.2 FalconView Zones definition 
MIL-STD-2411 divides the world into 18 zones, nine in the northern hemisphere and nine in the 
southern hemisphere.  The first eight zones in both hemispheres are divided into frames, which 
in turn are divided into sub-frames.  Frames are made of pixels with 1536 x 1536 pixels in a 
frame; there are 36, 6x6 sub-frames per frame.  Between each zone, there is an overlap of one 
frame; this implies that the size of zones will vary slightly depending on the resolution that is 
used.  Table A-5 Zones Range No Overlap gives the approximate range of each zones; 1 – 9 in 
the north, A - J in the south.  The two extreme zones, which cover the north and south poles, use 
a different scheme and are not discussed here.

A.16.3 FalconView Zone resolution 
Along lines of constant longitude, the pixel constant used to determine the size of frames is a 
function of the resolution but is independent of the zone.  Along lines of constant latitude the 
constant is a function of both resolution and zone and is based on the mid latitude of the zone.

enumerates the factors for three resolutions.

The north-south or latitudinal pixel constant is the number of pixels from the equator to the pole 
(90°).  The east-west pixel constant is the number of pixels longitudinally from the 180° west 
longitude meridian going 360° in an easterly direction along the zone midpoint. 

 

A.16.4 FalconView Zone extension based on resolution 
To illustrate, we will use as an example a resolution of 10 meters. To calculate the exact 
latitudinal zone extent for a given resolution, first calculate the number of pixels in a degree of 

latitude for the resolution 7777.11121

The number of frames needed to reach the nominal zone boundary is the number of pixels per 
degree of latitude multiplied by the nominal zone boundary (in degrees), divided by 1536, the 
number of pixels rows in a frame, and rounded up to the nearest integer.  For example in the first

MIL-C-89041 states that “the origin for counting nonpolar frame rows and columns is the 
southernmost latitude of the zone and 180° west longitude, with columns counted in an easterly 
direction from that origin, as opposed to frames and subframes where “the origin for the 
subframe and pixel numbering within frames and subframes shall be from the upper left corner”. 

 

For a given latitude φ  and longitude λ the row and column for the frame where that 
geographic position is situated can be computed.  The determination of the zone is derived from

A.16.6 FalconView File Naming Convention 
MIL-C-89041 for Controlled Image Base (CIB) states that: 

 

“The naming convention for all resolutions of images registered in MIL-STD-2411-1, where it is 
intended for producers to provide contiguous [frame file] coverage, shall conform to MIL-STD-
2411.  In addition, the CIB [frame file] names are further restricted to conform to the form 
“ffffffvp.ccz.”  The “ffffff” portion of the name shall be a radix 34 value that encodes the unique 
cumulative frame number within a zone in base 34, with the right-most digit being the least 
significant position. The radix 34 value incorporates the numbers 0 through 9 and letters A 
through Z exclusive of the letters “I” and “O” as they are easily confused with the numbers “1” 
and “0”.  For example, the “ffffff” portion of the names would start with “000000,” 
proceed through “000009,” “00000Z,” “000010,” and so forth until “ZZZZZZ.”  This allows 
1,544,804,416 unique [frame file] names; a contiguous grid of frame names down to a resolution 
of 0.2 meters (approximately 8 inches) can be defined.  The “v” portion of the name shall be a 
radix 34 value that encodes the successive version number.  The “p” portion of the name shall be 
a radix 34 value that designates the producer code ID, as defined in MIL-STD-2411-1.  The 
“cc” and “z” portions of the name extension shall encode the data series code and the zone, 
respectively, as defined in MIL-STD-2411-1.  The CIB producers are responsible to ensure that 
[frame files] for all image resolutions, zones, and revisions, have unique names.” 

In our case:    ffffff crzRC NFF ×+=  

  … rzNczt  resolutiona for   zone in columns ofnumber   theis  where  

 

In the example of a lat of 36 and lon –88 with a resolution of 10 meters we get:

ffffff = 503+29x1970=57633 or 001FV3(34) 

 

… where 1970 is number columns in zone 2 as given in Table A-7 Frame/Subframe Sizes for 
Source Image GSD of 10 Meters, and in RADIX 34 we get ffffff = 001FV3 ; for a global 
navigation chart dataset a version level 0, a manufacturer code of 3 and zone 2 the file name 
would be equal to “001FV303.GN2” 

Note that nothing in the file name defines the resolution for the data; this information is part of 
the [coverage section] in the file itself (see section 3.12.3 in MIL-C-89041).  Also note that the 
file name is unique only to the zone at a given resolution. 

On the other hand a similar file for imagery (VSTI, Visible Spectrum Terrain Imagery) in the 
CDB convention for an LOD of 04 which has a resolution of approximately 8 meters; at position 
lat 36 and lon –88 we would get for the file name: 

 

\CDB\Tiles\N36\W088\004_Imagery\L04\U0\ 
N36W088_D004_S001_T001_L04_U0_R0.jp2 

 

Note that the file name itself is unique worldwide and that from it we can derive the directory 
path to which it belongs. 

A.17 Information: JPEG-2000 
The CDB specification supports JPEG2000 for both VSTI and VSTLM component data. 

 

As a result of the high rates of compression there are no real advantages to be gained in 
supporting a broad range of alternate color representations (such as single channel 
representations, indexed color representations, RGB-triplet color encoding such as 5-6-5, etc.).  
The underlying motivation behind all such schemes is driven by a desire to reduce storage and 
transmission bandwidths.  JPEG-2000 achieves these goals and many others, refer to Table A-8 
JPEG 2000 Features.

A.18 Information: Managing CDB Versions 
The incremental versioning mechanism of the CDB provides a fast method of creating versions 
of the CDB changes since all the data changes are located under a single root directory.  The 
creation and the managing of the (incremental) data files are however under the application 
control. 

A CDB can simultaneously hold multiple incremental versions of the data.  As a result, it is 
possible to select any of the versions without transferring or copying files.  Consider the case 
where a database generation facility, a database quality assurance facility, a simulator mission 
planning facility, a mission rehearsal facility and a mission debrief are all operating concurrently 
on distinct versions of the CDB.  This is illustrated in Figure 3 2: Concurrent Usage of Versions 
of the CDB.  By the fourth day, there are four versions of the CDB, say the active default CDB 
(v1) and three incremental versions (v2, v3, v4).  Any of these four versions can be instantly 
invoked (without copying or transferring files) by the simulator operator at the Mission 
Rehearsal facility, or by an instructor at the Mission Debrief facility.

The underlying CDB versioning mechanism is a fine-grained file-level mechanism, i.e., only the 
affected files of the geographic areas of the CDB need to be versioned, leaving the rest of the 
CDB intact.  This approach is invaluable in mission rehearsal applications where the target areas 
of the CDB require frequent updates based on the latest intelligence data. 

The approach can also be applied to the handling of classified secure data.  In this case, a CDB 
version can be used to hold the portion of the CDB that contains the classified information.  The 
incremental versioning mechanism would be used to segregate the classified portion of the CDB 
onto a separate storage medium.  Since the classified portion of the CDB is embedded within the 
overall CDB structure, it is possible for the runtime publishers to instantly switch back and forth 
between the classified and non-classified versions of the database. 

A.19 Guideline: Handling of GS and T2D Models 
A.19.1 GSModels 
A.19.1.1 GSModel Levels-of-detail 
The insertion of a 3DModel-LOD into the LOD hierarchy of the GSModel Dataset is solely 
dependent on its Location, its Significant Size and on its Storage Size. 

The location and Significant Size of a 3DModel-LOD determines where it is nominally inserted 
into the GSModel Dataset hierarchy.  This approach ensures that the modeled content is 
organized in files that contain co-located objects of similar size.  This approach provides client-
device with an optimal means of accessing and filtering modeled content (by location and by 
size).

Figure A-25: Handling Tile-LOD Overflows in GSModel Dataset 

 

3DModel-LODs are accumulated into the Tile-LODs of the GSModel hierarchy.  The size of 
these Tile-LODs is capped to GSModelFileSize.  In the event that a group of 3DModel-LODs 
nominally assigned to a Tile-LOD causes this limit to be exceeded, the 3DModel-LODs that are 
deemed to have the lowest contribution to the Tile-LOD are moved to finer (children) Tile-LODs 
until the Tile-LOD is once again within its size limit (illustrated in Figure A-25: Handling Tile-
LOD Overflows in GSModel Dataset).  In the event that a 3DModel-LOD is itself larger than 
GSModelFileSize, the 3DModel-LOD is moved to the 4 finer Tile-LODs of the GSModel

Dataset hierarchy. This approach ensures that the modeled content is accessible in chunks that 
are bounded; this improves the allocation and management of memory allocation in the client-
devices. 

 

 

NOTE:  The Significant Size of a 3DModel-LOD determines where it is nominally 
inserted into the 3DModel LOD hierarchy.  In this nominal case, each Tile-LOD 
of the 3DModel Dataset holds a group of 3DModels-LODs that have similar 
Significant Sizes.  This enables the client-devices to determine the range at 
which the 3DModel-LOD can be optimally blended-in to the scene (so that the 
model falls within a specified angular error criterion). 

 
The bounding criterion of 3DModel Tiles can lead to LOD migration, thus breaking 

the relationship between the Significant Size of a 3DModel-LOD and the 
nominal CDB LOD it belongs to.  As a result, client-devices can no longer 
guarantee the range at which the 3DModel-LOD will be blended-in to the scene.  
In effect, each time the 3DModel-LOD is migrated by one LOD, the client-device 
will likely shorten the range at which it is blended into the scene by a factor of 
2X, leading to potentially distracting artifacts.  The severity of the artifacts is 
proportional to the amount of content that has migrated to finer LODs and to the 
number of LODs by which the content has moved. 

 
While the CDB Specification allows the migration of 3DModel-LODs to finer LODs 

when Tile-LODs overflows are encountered, it is understood that this may lead 
to rendering artifacts that might be considered unsatisfactory.  Consequently, it 
is strongly recommended that tools (that generate the CDB hierarchy) be 
designed to optionally disallow the migration of 3DModel-LODs to finer 
LODs upon overflows, and instead flag the overflow condition and then 
abort.  Upon such cases, modelers can then re-assess which 3DModels should 
be discarded or remodeled in order to simultaneously satisfy the CDB bounding 
criteria and the application requirements. 

 

 

Each of the 3DModel-LODs is nominally configured as exchange-LODs.  The exchange-LOD 
mechanism assumes that client-devices gradually substitute a coarser 3DModel-LOD located in a 
coarser Tile-LOD with a finer 3DModel-LOD located in a finer Tile-LOD. 

While this exchange-LOD mechanism is simple, it can lead to inefficiencies when extremely fine 
features cause the GSModel Dataset hierarchy to be extended by several LODs.  Consider the 
case of a 1 meter road sign located next to a large building (30m wide x 30m long x 10 m high).  
As we will see in the following section, the road sign would nominally be inserted at LOD 9 of 
the GSModel Dataset hierarchy.  Conversely, the large modeled building would nominally be

additional LODs.

In order to reduce the depth of the LOD hierarchy, the GSModel Dataset is post-processed and 
subjected to a “compaction” process, starting from the finest LOD (e.g. LODmax) and progressing 
to the coarser levels.  The compaction process takes finer 3DModel-LODs and appends them to

the corresponding 3DModels in coarser Tile-LODs of the GSModel Dataset.  The appended 
(finer) 3DModel-LOD must have an explicit OpenFlight LOD node with the Significant Size of 
the 3DModel-LOD; this provides the necessary information for the client-device to control the 
range at which the 3DModel-LOD will be introduced into the rendered scene.  The process is 
recursively applied to the coarser LODs until the parent LOD is packed to capacity.  This 
approach ensures that the modeled content is accessible in similarly-sized chunks of processing; 
this provides the means to improve internal parallelism and pipelining (i.e. improves client-
device determinism) 

The access and selection of 3DModel-LODs is done through the GSFeature Dataset.  Each of the 
Tile-LODs of the GSFeature Dataset contains a list of Features; each Feature in turn points to a 
3DModel-LOD at the appropriate LOD.  In effect, the appearance of a Feature (along with its 
modeled representation) and the evolution of its modeled representation are entirely controlled 
by the GSFeature Dataset.  As a result, the 3DModel-LODs of a 3DModel need not be located in 
consecutive LODs of GSModel Dataset hierarchy. 

A.19.1.2 CDB LOD versus GSModel Significant Size 
Chapter 6 provides a set of guidelines to establish the values for Significant Size SSc and SSLOD 
for GSModels. 

Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution shows the nominal position of a GSModel within the 
LOD hierarchy of the GSModel Dataset.  Note all of the GSModel-LODs of a GSModel 
normally fall within a range of 8 levels-of-detail (i.e. the smallest tile size the GSModel can sit 
on).  However, it is possible to extend this range by breaking up a GSModel-LOD into several 
OpenFlight files. 

Here is a summary of the rules required by the CDB Specification in order to ensure 
deterministic operation from client-devices: 

1. Each feature may have multiple modeled representations at progressively coarser 
levels of detail.  Each of the modeled representations is referred to as a GSModel-
LOD.  In absence of pre-modeled coarser LOD representations, the tools may 
automatically generate coarser modeled levels-of-detail. 

2. A GSModel-LOD consists of a group of polygons that represent a feature at a 
specific level-of-detail; this group of polygons shares a unique Model Identifier 
derived from the Feature Attribute Code (FACC), a Feature Sub-Code (FSC), a 
Model Name (MODL or MMDC), the GSModel-LOD’s Significant Size SS’LOD. 

3. Each GSModel has a distinct Significant Size SS’ value based on its dimensions.  
In turn, each GSModel-LOD of a same GSModel has a distinct Significant Size 
value SS’LOD based on its modeled accuracy. 

4. Insertion of a GSModel-LOD into the GSModel Dataset hierarchy proceeds as 
follows.  Starting with LODmax (LODmax is a variable set by the user that sets the 
maximum depth of the LOD hierarchy) and progressing to coarser LODs… 
a. For each Tile-LOD, create a Model_List that is constructed from the 

GSModel-LODs that straddle the Tile-LOD.

i. If the GSModel-LOD is not the coarsest LOD and its Significant Size is in 
accordance to  Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, then add it to 
the Tile-LOD. Only the coarser GSModel-LODs of this GSModel are 
available for future insertion into the GSModel LOD hierarchy. 

ii. If the GSModel-LOD is the coarsest LOD of the GSModel and its Significant 
Size is in accordance to  Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, then 
insert it at this LOD of the hierarchy. If the GSModel-LOD matches the Tile-
LOD, remove it from the list for the processing of the coarser Tile-LOD. 

b. If the Model_List is less than GSModelFileSize, no further processing is 
required. 

NOTE: The Storage Size of (statically-positioned) MModels is assumed to be 
zero. 

c. The Model_List of each Tile-LOD is sorted in decreasing order of Diff, where 
Diff is the difference between the Significant Size SS of the Model and the 
Significant Size as specified in Table 2. 

d. If the size of the Model_List is greater than GSModelFileSize, then (starting 
with the first entry in the sorted Model_List), Models are simplified one-by-
one until the size of the Model_List is less than GSModelFileSize.  When a 
simplification occurs, the Model_List is re-sorted using the Diff value. 

e. If a) the Model_List is deemed non-reducible and b) the Model_List is still 
greater than GSModelFileSize … 
i. If LOD < LODmax, then… 

(1) a Temp_Model_List is created and initialized with the  contents of the 
Model_list.  Starting from the end of the Model_List, Models are 
removed one-by-one from the Model_list (starting with the first Model 
in the Model_List) and are copied into the Temp_Model_List until the 
Model_List reaches GSModelFileSize. 

(2) The Temp_Model_List is merged to the children Tile-LODs and the 
children are re-processed using steps 4a to 4e.  The process is iterative, 
i.e., the “overflow” is propagated into the finer LODs of the GSModel 
hierarchy. 

ii. Else… 
(1)  Models are removed one-by-one, starting with the first Model in the 

Model_List, until the Model_List is less than GSModelFileSize.  The 
corresponding GSModels are removed from the CDB and a warning is 
issued stating that content was removed 

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that GSModels be modeled using several 
GSModel-LODs, spanning a wide range of fidelity.  The availability of many 
LODs ensures suitability of the resulting CDB for real-time use with a minimum 
degradation in fidelity.  Conversely, a low number of LODs can lead to 
unacceptably large steps in fidelity.

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that the coarsest modeled LOD of GSModels 
have no more than 128 vertices; this reduces the likelihood that the coarsest 
modeled LOD need be propagated to a finer LOD of the hierarchy. 

 

NOTE: This algorithm preserves the highest available modeled content while 
ensuring that the runtime constraint file size limits are respected.  While the 
CDB data model allows for infinitely-sized GSModel-LODs, a client-device may 
refuse to render the GSModel-LOD if it has insufficient memory to load all of the 
OpenFlight files that make-up the GSModel-LODs. 

 

5. Each GSModel-LOD is subject to an OpenFlight file size limit of 
GSModelFileSize, i.e. several OpenFlight files, each within the GSModelFileSize 
limit, can be used to represent a very complex GSModel-LOD. Each of 
OpenFlight files that form the GSModel-LOD share the same GSModel-LOD 
Identifier (see rule 2) and GSModel-LOD origin.  Client-devices must render the 
GSModel-LOD in its entirety, even if it is allocated to several OpenFlight files. 
 

NOTE: While the CDB data model allows for infinitely-sized GSModel-LODs, a 
client-device may refuse to render the GSModel-LOD if it has insufficient 
memory to load all of the OpenFlight files that make-up the GSModel-LODs. 

 

6. Each Tile-LOD is subject to a file size limit of GSModelFileSize. 
7. All of the GSModel-LODs in a GSModel OpenFlight file are nominally 

exchange-LODs (see exception in next rule). 
8. The depth of the GSModel LOD hierarchy should be reduced by folding-in the 

finer GSModel-LOD located in a finer Tile-LOD to the next coarser Tile-LOD of 
the hierarchy.  Failure to perform this “compaction step” may result in 
significantly deeper GSModel LOD hierarchy when the finest GSModel-LODs 
consist of small features or small details on the same features (e.g., small posts 
next to a terminal building or fine window details on a large building). 

9. The finer modeled representation of a GSModel (i.e. a GSModel-LOD with a 
smaller Significant Size) always appears in finer LODs of the GSModel Dataset 
LOD hierarchy than a coarser GSModel-LOD. 

10. A Tile-LOD cannot contain more than one GSModel-LOD of the same GSModel. 
11. Once inserted into the GSModel Dataset LOD hierarchy, there is no mandatory 

requirement to clip the contents of a GSModel Tile-LOD against its Tile-LOD 
boundaries.  However, the contents of the GSModel Tile-LOD cannot protrude 
Tile-LODs by more than ½ the dimension of the Tile-LOD.

12. There is no mandatory requirement to have consecutive GSModel-LODs in 
consecutive LODs of Tile-LOD hierarchy; it is permissible to have gaps within 
the Tile-LOD hierarchy. 

13. Gaps in the LOD file hierarchy of the GSFeature Dataset are not permitted.  This 
may result in Tile-LODs that are empty (e.g. without any GSFeatures).  The 
presence of an empty Tile-LOD file for the GSFeature Dataset indicates the 
availability of modeled content invoked by finer LODs of the GSFeature 
hierarchy. 

A.19.1.3 Example – Insertion of a GSModel with 3 LODs into the CDB Hierarchy 
Consider an industrial building 200m wide x 200m length x 10m high.  The modeler has not 
supplied any values for its Significant Size, nor has he provided a value for RTAI.  It is modeled 
in three distinct levels of detail as follows: 

a) Coarsest level: 5 polygons 
b) Mid level: 60 polygons 
c) Finest level: 300 polygons 

Based on this information, we can derive Significant Size values for each of the modeled 
representation as follows and determine where within the hierarchy each of the GSModel-LODs 
should be inserted: 

 

a. Coarsest level-of-detail: 
a. Compute the model’s Significant Size … 

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 =   
10×.96)×200 +    200×200×.259  

𝜋𝜋  

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 =   62.5𝑚𝑚 

b. Since the model is opaque and has no assigned value for RTAI, the final value 
for SS’ is 62.5m. 

c.  Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, tells us that the (coarsest 
LOD) of the model should be nominally inserted at LOD 3 of the Tile-LOD 
(assuming its file size limit is not exceeded) 

b. Mid level-of-detail: 
a. Compute the ratio of vertices 

  𝑅𝑅 =   𝑉𝑉 𝑉𝑉 =
60
5 = 12 

b. Compute the Significant Size of the GSModel-LOD… 

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆′ =
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆′

12
= 18.04𝑚𝑚 

c. Since the model is opaque and has no assigned value for RTAI, the final value 
for SS’ is 18.04m.

d. d. Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, tells us that the (mid- LOD) 
of the model should be nominally inserted at LOD = 5 of the Tile-LOD 
(assuming its file size limit is not exceeded) 

c. Finest level-of-detail: 
a. Compute the ratio of vertices 

  𝑅𝑅 =   𝑉𝑉 𝑉𝑉 =
300
60 = 5 

b. Compute the Significant Size of the GSModel-LOD… 

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆′ =
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆′

= 8.07𝑚𝑚 

c. Since the model is opaque and has no assigned value for RTAI, the final value 
for 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆′  is 8.07. 

d. d. Table 3 1: CDB LOD vs. Model Resolution, tells us that the (finest-LOD) 
of the model should be nominally inserted at LOD = 6 of the Tile-LOD 
(assuming its file size limit is not exceeded) 

A.19.2 T2DModels 
The T2DModels are stored in the OpenFlight format.  The CDB conventions described herein 
are designed to facilitate the integration of such models onto the terrain tile, hence the name 
“Tiled 2D Models”.  Each 2DModel can have one or more modeled representation (called a 
2DModel-LOD) that represents the feature to a certain level of fidelity.  2DModel-LODs are re-
grouped into T2DModel Tile-LODs; this re-grouping approach is designed to reduce the 
overheads associated with the access of 2DModel-LODs.  Furthermore, T2DModel-LODs can be 
accessed without a prior reference to a corresponding feature in the GSFeature dataset. 

The integration of T2DModels to the underlying terrain skin is performed by the client-devices at 
runtime.  Historically, this integration has always been performed by the tools and was “baked-
in” into the SE terrain skin during the offline database generation process.  Many client-specific 
considerations went into the mechanisms required to support this integration and as a result, the 
resulting synthetic environments were very client-specific and did not scale easily to higher 
resolutions. 

In line with CDB principles, the T2DModel Dataset defers this integration and imposes it on the 
consumers (not the producers) of synthetic environments.  As a result, client-devices can 
independently access, manage and control each dataset, i.e., the Primary Elevation, the VSTI 
Imagery, the T2DModel, etc.  This layered approach to synthetic environment production and 
consumption provides a much greater level of abstraction between the SE data model and the 
data models internal to each client-device.  It is understood, that the deferral of the integration 
process imposes added functionality and computational requirements on the part of the CDB 
client-devices. 

While it would be possible, in theory, to use the T2DModel Dataset for the modeling of the 
terrain skin, this use-case is specifically forbidden because the T2DModel Dataset does not 
provide a guarantee of full tile coverage.  As a result, the Primary Elevation Dataset is always 
required regardless of whether a corresponding Tile-LOD of the T2DModel is present or not.

Furthermore, since CDB forbids the duplication of information, the terrain skin cannot be 
duplicated by the T2DModel Dataset. 

Client-devices must always access the Primary Elevation prior to any other raster datasets.  Once 
a Tile-LOD of the Primary Elevation is loaded, a client-device can then access the T2DModel 
Dataset at an “appropriate” LOD3.  Following this, the client-device must integrate the models 
found within the T2DModel Tile-LOD with the terrain found in the Primary Elevation dataset. 

A.19.2.1 T2DModel Levels-of-detail 
As with 3D features, 2D features can have modeled representations at varying levels of detail.  
Each of these modeled-representations is referred to as a 2DModel-LOD.  A 2DModel-LOD 
consists of a group of polygons that represent a 2D feature at a specific level-of-detail. 

Once a 2DModel-LOD is inserted into the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy, it is then referred to as 
a T2DModel-LOD.  The insertion of a 2DModel-LOD into the LOD hierarchy of the T2DModel 
Dataset is solely dependent on its Location, its Significant Size and on its Storage Size.  
2DModel-LODs are regrouped into files called T2DModel Tile-LODs.  Note that when a 
2DModel is clipped to the T2DModel’s Tile-LOD boundaries, each of the clipped model 
fragments will appear in distinct OpenFlight files of the T2DModel Dataset.  The T2DModel 
Tile-LODs are assembled into a hierarchy of Tile-LODs called the T2DModel Dataset. 

The organization of the modeled content into files that contain co-located objects of similar size 
greatly improves runtime performance.  The location and Significant Size of a 2DModel-LOD 
determines where it is nominally inserted into the T2DModel LOD hierarchy.  This approach 
ensures that the modeled content is organized in files that contain co-located objects of similarly 
size.  This approach provides client-device with an optimal means of accessing and filtering 
modeled content (by location and by size). 

2DModel-LODs are accumulated into Tiles for each LOD of the T2DModel hierarchy.  The size 
of these T2DModel Tiles is capped to T2DModelFileSize4.  In the event that the insertion of a 
2DModel-LOD causes this limit to be exceeded, the 2DModel-LODs that are deemed to have the 
lowest contribution to the Tile are moved to finer Tiles of the T2DModel hierarchy until the Tile 
is once again within its size limit.  In the event that the 2DModel-LOD is larger than 
T2DModelFileSize, the 2DModel-LOD can be moved to the 4 finer Tiles of the T2DModel 
hierarchy and clipped against the Tile boundaries as illustrated in Figure A-27: Handling Tile-
LOD Overflows within the T2DModel Dataset Hierarchy.  This approach ensures that the 
modeled content is accessible in chunks that are bounded; this is critical to the effective 
allocation and management of memory in the client-devices as well as improving client-device 
performance and determinism. 

 

                                                
3  In this context, “appropriate” means a LOD that falls within the capabilities of the client-device. 

4  The T2DModelFileSize storage size limit for T2DModel Tile-LODs is critical in achieving runtime 
determinism.

NOTE:  The Significant Size of a 2DModel-LOD determines where it is nominally 
inserted into the T2DModel LOD hierarchy.  In this nominal case, each Tile-LOD 
of the T2DModel Dataset holds a group of 2DModel-LODs that have similar 
Significant Sizes.  This enables the client-devices to determine the range at 
which the T2DModel-LOD can be optimally blended into the scene so that the 
model falls within a specified angular error criterion. 

 
The bounding criterion of T2DModel Tiles can lead to LOD migration, thus 

breaking the relationship between the Significant Size of a 2DModel-LOD and 
the nominal CDB LOD it belongs to.  As a result, client-devices can no longer 
guarantee the range at which the 2DModel-LOD will be blended into the scene.  
In effect, each time the 2DModel-LOD is migrated by one LOD, the client-device 
will likely shorten the range at which it is blended into the scene by a factor of 2, 
leading to potentially distracting artifacts.  The severity of the artifacts is 
proportional to the amount of content that has migrated to finer LODs and to the 
number of LODs by which the content has moved. 

 
While the CDB Specification allows the migration of 2DModel-LODs to finer LODs 

when Tile-LODs overflows are encountered, it is understood that this may lead 
to rendering artifacts that might be considered unsatisfactory.  Consequently, it 
is strongly recommended that tools (that generate the CDB hierarchy) be 
designed to optionally disallow the migration of T2DModel-LODs to finer 
LODs upon overflows, and instead flag the overflow condition and then 
abort.  Upon such cases, modelers can then re-assess which T2DModels 
should be discarded or remodeled in order to simultaneously satisfy the CDB 
bounding criteria and the application requirements. 

Each of the Tile-LODs of the T2DModel Dataset is nominally configured as exchange-LODs 
(aka substitution-LODs) as defined in chapter 6. 

The exchange-LOD mechanism assumes that client-devices gradually substitute a coarser Tile-
LOD with a four finer Tile-LODs. 

While this exchange-LOD mechanism is simple, it can lead to inefficiencies when extremely fine 
features cause the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy to be extended by several LODs.  Consider the 
case of 13m road lineals overlaid with 6 cm stripe lineals.  As we will see in the following 
section, insertion of the Stripe lineal would nominally occur at LOD=7 of the T2DModel 
hierarchy while the Road lineal would occur at LOD=-1.  The Stripe lineals force the T2DModel 
Dataset hierarchy to be extended (and clipped) to 8 additional LODs.  In effect, the Road lineals 
are repeated5 in LODs 0 through 7 leading to important storage inefficiencies and greater 
computational burden by the client-devices.

Figure A-27: Handling Tile-LOD Overflows within the T2DModel Dataset Hierarchy 

In order to resolve this use-case, the T2DModel Dataset is post-processed and subjected to a 
“compaction” process, starting from the finest LOD (e.g. LODmax) and progressing to the coarser 
levels.  The compaction process takes the content of the Tile-LODs located at LODmax and packs 
them as an additive LODs of the parent Tile-LOD at (LODmax – 1) of the parent Tile-LOD.  The 
process is recursively applied to the coarser LODs until the parent LOD is packed to capacity.  
This approach ensures that the modeled content is accessible in similarly-sized chunks of 
processing; this provides the means to improve internal parallelism and pipelining (ie. improves 
client-device determinism). The result is a LOD hierarchy which is less deep, and with content 
which is more uniformly distributed; both of these characteristics improve runtime performance 
and determinism.

The T2DModel LOD structure is continuous i.e. there is no gap in the LOD hierarchy.  This 
means that once a 2DModel-LOD is inserted into a finer level of the T2DModel hierarchy, the 
same 2DModel-LOD is propagated to coarser LODs until a coarser 2DModel-LOD is available. 

Note that some client-devices may be sensitive to the precision of clipped vertices; some client-
devices may demand that the clipped vertices be shared at the tile boundary between two tiles of 
the same LODs.  This can be done as follow: 

-­‐ The X coordinate (longitude) of clipped vertices along the top or bottom edges of 
the tile can be used to uniquely identify the matching coordinate in an adjacent tile. 

-­‐ The Y coordinate (latitude) of clipped vertices along the right or left edges of the 
tiles can be used to uniquely identify the matching coordinate in an adjacent tile.

A.19.2.2 CDB LOD versus T2DModel Significant Size 
Chapter 6 provides a set of guidelines to establish the values for Significant Size SSc and SSLOD 
for T2D Models (for both lineals and areals). 

Table 3 32: T2DModel LOD versus Significant Size, shows us the relationship between SSc and 
SSLOD.  They are offset by 3 LODs.  The implication of this statement is in the case of a model 
with two LOD, the finer 2DModel-LOD must have sufficient detail to justify its existence.

Note:  Each of the 2DModel-LODs of a 2DModel must differ by at least one CDB 
LOD.  Some 2DModel-LODs will be discarded if this relationship is not 
respected. 

Consider for example a 12m lineal road feature with two modeled representations.  The nominal 
CDB LOD for the coarsest 2DModel-LOD is LOD=3 in accordance to the table below.  The 
Significant Size of the finer 2DModel-LOD is obtained by “walking” around its outline; we 
determine that the largest value of d for successive vertex triplets is 3m, hence SSLOD = 3m.  
Table A-9: T2DModel LOD versus Significant Size, tells us that the 2DModel-LOD should also 
be nominally inserted at CDB LOD = 3.  Since both 2DModel-LODs have the same nominal 
CDB LOD, only one of them is retained (preferably the more detailed of the two)

A.19.2.3  Rules Governing T2DModel LOD Hierarchy 
Here is a summary of the rules required by the specification in order to ensure deterministic 
operation from client-devices: 

1. Each feature may have multiple modeled representations at progressively coarser 
levels of detail.  Each of the modeled representations is referred to as a 2DModel-
LOD.  In absence of pre-modeled coarser LOD representations, the tools may 
automatically generate coarser modeled levels-of-detail. 

2. A 2DModel-LOD consists of a group of polygons that represent a feature at a 
specific level-of-detail; this group of polygons shares a common Feature Attribute 
Code (FACC), a Feature Sub-Code (FSC), a Model Name (MODL) and 
2DModel-LOD’s Significant Size SS’LOD. 

3. Each 2DModel has a distinct Significant Size value SS’ based on its dimensions.  
In turn, each of the 2DModel-LODs of a 2DModel has a distinct Significant Size 
value SS’LOD based on its modeled accuracy. 

4. Insertion of a 2DModel-LOD into the T2DModel Dataset hierarchy proceeds as 
follows.  Starting with LODmax (LODmax is a variable set by the user that sets the 
maximum depth of the LOD hierarchy) and progressing to coarser LODs… 
a. For each Tile-LOD, create a Model_List that is constructed from the 

2DModel-LODs that straddle the Tile-LOD. 
i. If the 2DModel-LOD is not the coarsest LOD and its Significant Size is in 

accordance to Table A-9: T2DModel LOD versus Significant Size, then 
iteratively simplify the 2DModel-LOD (iterate until its Significant Size is 
no longer in accordance to Table A-9: T2DModel LOD versus Significant 
Size and keep results of previous iteration) and add it to the Tile-LOD.  
Only the coarser 2DModel-LODs of this 2DModel are available for future 
insertion into the T2DModel hierarchy. 

ii. If the 2DModel-LOD is the coarsest LOD of the 2DModel and its 
Significant Size is in accordance to Table A-9: T2DModel LOD versus 
Significant Size, insert it at this LOD of the hierarchy.  If the 2DModel-
LOD matches the Tile-LOD, remove it from the list for the processing of 
the coarser Tile-LOD. 

b. If the Model_List is less than T2DModelFileSize, no further processing is 
required. 

c. The Model_List of each Tile-LOD is sorted in decreasing order of Diff, where 
Diff is the difference between the Significant Size SS of the Model and the 
Significant Size as specified in Table 3. 

d. If the Model_List is greater than T2DModelFileSize, then (starting with the 
first entry in the sorted Model_List), Models are simplified one-by-one until 
the size of the Model_List is less than T2DModelFileSize.  When a 
simplification occurs, the Model_List is re-sorted using the Diff value.

e. If a) the Model_List is deemed non-reducible and b) the Model_List is still 
greater than T2DModelFileSize … 
i. If LOD < LODmax, then… 

(1) a Temp_Model_List is created and initialized with the  contents of the 
Model_list.  Starting from the end of the Model_List, Models are 
removed one-by-one from the Model_list (starting with the first Model 
in the Model_List) and are copied into the Temp_Model_List until the 
Model_List reaches T2DModelFileSize. 

(2) The Temp_Model_List is merged to the children Tile-LODs and the 
children are re-processed using steps 4a to 4e.  The process is iterative, 
i.e., the “overflow” is propagated into the finer LODs of the 
T2DModel hierarchy. 

ii. Else… 
(1) Models are removed one-by-one, starting with the first Model in the 

Model_List, until the Model_List is less than T2DModelFileSize.  The 
corresponding T2DModels are removed from the CDB and a warning 
is issued stating that content was removed. 
 

NOTE: The algorithm preserves the highest available modeled content while 
ensuring that the runtime constraint file size limits are respected.  While the 
CDB data model allows for infinitely-sized 2DModel-LODs, a client-device may 
refuse to render the 2DModel-LOD if it has insufficient memory to load all of the 
OpenFlight files that make-up the 2DModel-LOD. 

 

5. Each T2DModel Tile-LOD is subject to an OpenFlight file size limit of 
T2DModelFileSize, i.e., several OpenFlight files, each within the 
T2DModelFileSize file size limit, can be used to represent a very complex 
T2DModel Tile-LOD.  Each of T2DModel-LODs of an T2DModel Tile-LOD 
share the same T2DModel-LOD Identifier (see rule 2) 

6. Each Tile-LOD is subject to a file size limit of T2DModelFileSize. 
7. All of the 2DModel-LODs in a T2DModel Tile-LOD are nominally exchange-

LODs (see exception in next rule). 
8. The depth of the T2DModel LOD hierarchy should be reduced by folding-in the 

Tile-Models_List of finer Tile-LODs as an additive LOD to the Tile-Model_List 
of a coarser Tile-LOD.  Failure to perform this “compaction step” may result in 
significantly deeper T2DModel LOD hierarchy when the finest 2DModel-LODs 
consist of small details (e.g., thin stripes and markings on roads), and reduce the 
paging performance of client-devices. 

9. The finer modeled representation of a T2DModel (i.e., a 2DModel-LOD with a 
smaller Significant Size) always appears in finer LODs of the Tile-LOD hierarchy 
than a coarser 2DModel-LOD. 

10. A Tile-LOD cannot contain more than one 2DModel-LOD of the same 
T2DModel.

11. All T2DModels are clipped against the Tile-LOD boundaries. 
12. Gaps in the LOD file hierarchy of the T2DModel Dataset are not permitted.  This 

may result in Tile-LODs that are empty (e.g., without any T2DModels).  The 
presence of an empty Tile-LOD file indicates the availability of content in 
T2DModel files located in finer LODs of the T2DModel hierarchy. 

 
 

A.20 Guideline: Examples of Vector Dataset Usages 
A.20.1 Lineal Feature Radar Simulation Example 
The following diagram represents a typical usage of a lineal model in the CDB for a typical radar 
client-device. 

The radar application first extracts the lineal feature from the CDB and constructs an object.  The 
constructed object contains the necessary information for the radar to compute the equivalent 
radar image using the radar cross-section (RCS) of the lineal features with material attributes and 
directivity, etc. 

 

NOTE: With the introduction of version 3.2 of the CDB Specification, it is recommended that 
the terrain-conformal features be modeled using T2DModels and that radar client-
devices use this modeled representation instead of the vector lineal and areal 
features. 

 

Figure A-31: Example of Lineal Features, illustrates three lineal features stored in the tile in 
Shape format.  The junction nodes of each lineal feature represents the start and end junctions of 
the lineal feature.  In this example, there is only one chain per lineal feature. 

                                                
 

8 The SGI format is fully supported by the CDB Specification but a single file extension used, *.rgb.  Consequently, 
all image formats (int, inta, rgb, and rgba) are stored in .rgb files regardless of the number of channels in the image.

Figure A-31: Example of Lineal Features 

The radar uses the position of the lineal coordinates to construct a line representation of the radar 
image.  It extracts the lineal feature information from the chains to construct an internal local 
representation.  The necessary information needed by radar is: 

1. Network Datasets:  
The datasets along with the Feature Attribution Code (FACC) indicate if 
the feature is a road, a highway, or river for example.  In the above 
illustration, we have a river, a powerline and a railway.  The CDB 
Specification represents this in the *.dbf file of the Shapefile 
representation. 

2. Composite Material IndeX (CMIX):  
The Composite Material IndeX attribute points to the Composite Material 
Table and provides the Radar the types of Base Materials that the feature 
is made of.  This information is used, in addition to the geometry of the 
lineal feature or a generic RCS, to provide a radar signature of the target, 
which is proportional to the reflection value of the various materials.  The 
intensity of the radar image represents the interaction of the simulated 
Radar Beam with the features in the synthetic environment.  Each lineal 
contains a reference to a composite material which in turn is mapped to a 
reflectivity factor value in the radar simulation. 

3. Width (WGP):  
The width of the lineal features is also taken into consideration.  This 
information is part of the Shapefile data used to construct a 2D radar 
image of the terrain.  The width information is encoded as an attribute of 
the lineal feature. 

4. Height (HGT):  
The height of the lineal feature is used to indicate the height of each 
point/lineal with respect to the terrain height.

NOTE: The height value is a delta height above the terrain and is only 
provided for objects that require it such as the powerlines or the train 
tracks in this example. 
The height property is especially valuable to radar client-devices because 
erect objects in the database produce significant returns and occultation 
areas in the displayed radar image.  The height property can be assigned to 
the train tracks, long fences and the powerlines each with average 
altitudes. 

5. Position:  
This information is contained in the lineal *.shp files.  The x and y 
coordinate of each point is extracted from those objects. 

 
Figure A-32: Radar Beam Simulation 

The radar then uses a beam simulation to process the above information and construct an image 
representing the content of each small beam sections.  The intersection of the beam pie slice is 
compared with the lineal feature’s position and converted into an image whose intensity is based 
on the computed RCS of the lineal features.  As mentioned above, the RCS value (which is 
modeled internally in the radar simulation) takes into account the properties (which are derived 
from the attributes) of each lineal feature. 

A.20.2 Road Following Example 
Figure A-33: Network Dataset Used to Describe a Navigable Network, illustrates how lineal 
features can be used to describe a navigable network; the example could represent a network of 
roads.  First, the application reads a lineal shape file describing the chains, then the point shape 
file describing the junction nodes.  For each junction nodes the application makes up a list of 
attached chains ending up with a network as illustrated in Figure A-33: Network Dataset Used to 
Describe a Navigable Network, where there are six chains (labeled in this example as CSLID1 to

CSLID6) that are joined through intersection nodes (labeled in this example as CSZID1 to 
CSZID6).  The small black dots represent points forming the segments of a chain; they are 
essentially used to describe the deviation from a straight line between nodes. 

In Figure A-33: Network Dataset Used to Describe a Navigable Network, the green line shows 
an example of what a shortest path algorithm could determine if asked to find the shortest route 
between CSZID1 and CSZID5 based on the lengths of the chains.  First, the algorithm would 
move to CSZID2 via the chain CSLID1; when at CSZID2 it has two alternatives, either take 
CSLID4 or use CSLID3 and CSLID6.  In our example it would have determined that the latter 
alternative is the shortest path; the entity would then follow the path given by the green line 
going through all the segments in the chains. 

 
Figure A-33: Network Dataset Used to Describe a Navigable Network 

A.20.3 Point Feature Radar Simulation Example 
The following diagram represents a typical usage of a point feature as modeled in the CDB for a 
typical radar client-device.  The radar client-device extracts the point feature from the database 
using the format described in the Specification and constructs an object.  The constructed object 
will contain the necessary information for the radar to compute the equivalent radar image using 
the radar cross-section (RCS) of the object over the terrain; the RCS is derived from the point 
features characteristics.

NOTE: The example below illustrates the use of point-feature data by a radar client-device.  
However, we recommend that the radar client-devices use the modeled 
representation of the feature rather than the feature location, type and attribution 
data. 

In Figure A-34: Objects Represented on a Terrain Tile, a series of different objects are 
represented on a terrain tile.  The objects are modeled as single point of zero dimensions in radar.  
The radar will position the different points according to their geographic position and altitude.  
The height data corresponds to a height of the feature with respect to the terrain. 

 

 
Figure A-34: Objects Represented on a Terrain Tile 

 

The necessary information needed by radar is typically: 

6. Feature Attribution Code (FACC): 
This information indicates if the feature is a tree, a pylon, or a church for 
example.  In the above drawing this would mean a tree, an industry, a 
house or a radio station antenna. 

7. Composite Material IndeX (CMIX): 
The Composite Material IndeX attribute points to the Composite Material 
Table and provides the Radar client-device with the type of material that 
the feature is made of.  This information is used, in addition to the width 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014

of the point feature, to provide a generic RCS of the target, which is 
proportional to the reflection value of the various materials.  The RCS is 
then used by radar to determine the intensity of the radar image 
representing the point feature, based on the aspect and grazing angles to 
the Radar Beam.  Each point contains a reference to a Composite Material. 

8. Bounding Sphere Radius (BSR): 
The radius of the point is also taken into consideration.  This information 
is part of the shape data used to construct a 2D radar image of the terrain.  
The width is part of the point object attributes. 

9. Height (HGT): 
Since the radar sees the terrain with a perspective angle that can be 
computed using the radar altitude and the feature distance, the height of 
objects on the terrain becomes important to create the radar display image.  
This attribute of the point is used to indicate the differential height of each 
point with respect to the terrain height.  In the example above, the trees all 
have the same average altitude.  The other point features have different 
height. 

10. Position: 
The object point location in the CDB.  The x and y coordinate of each 
point is extracted from those objects.  The position when combined with 
the delta heights will create a pseudo-3D point feature object. 

11. Orientation (AO1): 
The radar needs the orientation of each point feature.  This is needed 
because radar has a series of RCS tables, one for each of the Feature 
Identification Code.  Those RCS tables give the RCS value for each 
incident angle of the radar beam.  This angle is computed by taking into 
account the radar beam angle and the point feature orientation.  For 
example, in the above drawing, the radio antenna has an orientation of 90 
degrees.  This means that if a radar beam comes from the right and points 
to the antenna at 270 degrees, the RCS value will be at maximum.  The 
radar simulation would use a RCS table that represents the RCS with 
respect to the incident angle as follows: 

 
Figure A-35: Incident Angle

Figure A-36: Beam Simulation 

The radar then uses a beam simulation to process the above information and construct an image 
representing the content of each small beam sections.  The intersection of the beam pie slice is 
compared with the point’s position and converted into an image whose intensity is based on the 
computed RCS of the points.  As mentioned above, this RCS takes into account the attributes of 
each point feature. 

If the size of the object referred to by the point feature is much larger than a specific threshold, 
the simulation could in addition use the MODL field of that point feature to extract a more 
precise geometrical 3D model from the CDB to increase the simulation fidelity. 

A.20.4 Areal Feature Radar Simulation Example 
The following diagram represents a typical usage of an areal feature as modeled in the CDB for a 
radar client-device. 

NOTE: With the introduction of version 3.2 of the CDB Specification,we recommend that the 
terrain-conformal features be modeled using T2DModels and that radar client-
devices use this modeled representation instead of the vector linear and areal 
features. 

In a manner similar to the lineal example, the Radar extracts this areal (aka polygon or polyline) 
from the database using the Shape (*.shp) file and construct a tile in its memory.  The 
constructed tile will contain the necessary information for the radar to compute the equivalent 
radar image using the radar cross-section (RCS) of the represented surface polygon over the 
terrain intersecting the Radar beam. 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification

Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014

In Figure A-37: Four Areal Features Stored in the Tile, four areal features are stored in the tile 
with their surface material and feature classification attributes.  Each of the features points to an 
array of segments. 

 
Figure A-37: Four Areal Features Stored in the Tile 

The radar simulation uses the segment coordinates to construct a polygonal representation on the 
radar image.  It extracts the areal feature attribute information from the segments and constructs 
its tile data in memory.  The necessary information needed by the radar simulation is typically: 

12. Feature Classification Code (FACC): 
This information is the identification of the surface feature.  It indicates if 
the areal feature represents a forest, a lake, or an airport runway for 
example.  In the above drawing, this would translate to a forested area, a 
grassy area, a concrete section and a dual runway intersection. 

13. Composite Material IndeX (CMIX): 
The Composite Material IndeX Surface Material Code attribute points to 
the Composite Material Table and provides to the Radar with the type of 
material that the feature is made of.  This information is used, in addition 
to the shape of the areal feature, to provide a generic RCS of the simulated 
area.  This RCS is proportional to the reflection value of the various 
materials constituting the polygon or the simulated texture of its 
components (e.g., an industrial area made up of metallic roofs).  The RCS 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification

is then used by radar to determine the intensity of the radar image 
representing the areal feature, based on the aspect and grazing angles to 
the Radar Beam.  Each chain will contain a reference to a material 
namespace object in the CDB. 

14. Height (HGT): 
Normally, the radar simulation sees the terrain with a perspective angle 
that can be computed using the radar altitude and the feature distance.  
Because of this angle, the height of objects on the terrain becomes 
important to create the image that the radar “sees”.  This attribute of the 
chain is used to indicate the average height of each areal object.  In the 
example above, the forested area could be elevated to roughly 25 or 30 
feet to produce a forest ”canopy” which will look elevated to the radar. 

The following image shows how a typical radar beam would intersect the different parts of areal 
features that are part of the terrain represented previously. 

Figure A-38: Radar Beam Simulation, shows the radar using a beam simulation to extract the 
above information and construct an image representing the content of each small beam sections 
(aka bins).  The intersection of the beam pie slice is performed against the areal feature polygons.  
Then the material of the polygon falling in the beam bin is converted into image intensity, which 
is relative to the computed RCS of that polygon’s material.  As mentioned above, this RCS takes 
into account the attributes of the segment of each areal feature.

1 OpenFlight® Scene Description 
The following symbols have been used throughout the document to specify the 
conventions established by OpenFlight/CDB. 

ü =  The record, field or value is supported by OpenFlight/CDB readers and follows 
the same conventions and usage as the OpenFlight Standard 

 =  The record, field is not considered by OpenFlight/CDB readers (e.g. ignored) 

 =  The record, field or value is specific to MultiGen-Paradigm and therefore is not 
considered by OpenFlight/CDB readers (e.g. ignored) 

 =  The value for the specified field is not supported by OpenFlight/CDB readers. 
OpenFlight/CDB readers ignore any fields with values that are not supported. 

 =  The record, field or value is specific to MultiGen’s Creator tool and therefore is 
not considered by OpenFlight/CDB readers (e.g. ignored) 

This document describes the OpenFlight Scene Description Database Specification, commonly 
referred to as simply “OpenFlight”. OpenFlight is a 3D scene description file format that was 
created and is maintained by MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. While OpenFlight databases are typically 
created and edited using MultiGen-Paradigm software tools, the format is widely adopted and as 
a result, many tools exist to read and write OpenFlight database files. 

The primary audience for this document includes software developers whose applications are 
intended to read and/or write OpenFlight database files. To this end, this document discusses 
concepts incorporated in OpenFlight and contains a detailed description of the physical layout of 
OpenFlight files as represented on disk.

OpenFlight Concepts 

The OpenFlight database format supports both simple and relatively sophisticated real-time 
software applications. The full implementation of OpenFlight supports variable levels of detail, 
degrees of freedom, sound, instancing (both within a file and to external files), replication, an-
imation sequences, bounding volumes for real-time culling, scene lighting features, light points 
and light point strings, transparency, texture mapping, material properties, and many other fea-
tures. 

A simple application that interprets an OpenFlight database can implement a subset of the  
database specification and use databases that contain that subset. Such an application could sim-
ply scan for the color palette, faces, and vertices, and ignores groups, objects, and other more 
sophisticated features. 

Database Hierarchy 

The OpenFlight database hierarchy organizes the visual database into logical groupings and 
facilitates real-time functions such as field-of-view culling, level-of-detail switching, and in-
stancing. Each OpenFlight database is organized in a tree structure. 

The database tree structure consists of nodes (historically called beads). Most nodes can have 
child nodes as well as sibling nodes. In general, nodes can be thought of in three hierarchical 
classes. Starting from the top of the hierarchy, these three node classes include container nodes, 
geometry nodes and vertex nodes.  

Container nodes are nodes that impose some logical grouping or behavior on the set of nodes it 
contains. The group node, for example allows you to “collect” similar nodes under one common 
parent for whatever reason your application needs. You might choose to group your nodes spa-
tially or by some other criteria important to your application. Another common container node, 
the level of detail node, imposes a particular visual behavior on the nodes it contains. It defines a 
range of distances inside which the nodes it contains are visible. 

Geometry nodes are nodes that actually represent some physical (renderable) geometry. The at-
tributes of geometry nodes typically include visual attributes such as color, material, texture, etc. 
The two main geometry nodes in OpenFlight are the face and mesh nodes. Other geometry nodes 
include the light point and text node. Though OpenFlight allows it, there are very few cases in 
which at least one geometry node is not contained somewhere below a container node. 

Vertex nodes are the building blocks of geometry nodes. Individually, a vertex node represents a 
discrete point in space. Collected together under a geometry node such as a face node, a set of 
vertex nodes define a closed (or unclosed) loop. A closed loop of vertex nodes defines a face (or 
polygon). The “front” side of the face is determined by the ordering in which the vertex nodes 
appear under the face node. An unclosed loop of vertex nodes defines a set of line segments, 
again oriented according to the order in which the vertex nodes appear. 

Each node type has data attributes specific to its function in the database. The principal node 
types in OpenFlight are described here: 

Header: There is one header node per database file. It is always the first node in the file and 
represents the top of the database hierarchy and tree structure. For more information, see “Header 
Record” on page 19.

Group: A group node distinguishes a logical subset of the database. Group nodes can be trans-
formed (translated, rotated, scaled, etc.). The transformation applies to itself and to all its chil-
dren. Groups can have child nodes and sibling nodes of any type, except a header node. For more 
information, see “Group Record” on page 22. 

Object: An object node contains a logical collection of geometry. It is effectively a low-level 
group node that offers some attributes distinct from the group node. For more information, see 
“Object Record” on page 25. 

Face: A face node represents geometry. Its children are limited to a set of vertices that describe a 
polygon, line, or point. For a polygon, the front side of the face is viewed from an in-order 
traversal of the vertices. Face attributes include color, texture, material, and transparency. For 
more information, see “Face Record” on page 26. 

Mesh: A mesh node defines geometric primitives that share attributes and vertices. See For more 
information, see “Mesh Nodes” on page 28. 

Light point: A light point node represents a collection of light point vertices or a replicated string 
of a single light point vertex. A light point is visible as one or more self-illuminated small points 
that do not illuminate surrounding objects. For more information, see “Light Point Nodes” on 
page 34. 

Light point system: A light point system enables you to collect a set of light points and 
enable/disable or brighten/dim them as a group. For more information, see “Light Point System 
Record” on page 37. 

Subface: A subface node is a face node that is assumed to be coplanar to, and drawn on top of, its 
superface. Subfaces can themselves be superfaces to allow multiple levels of “nesting”. This 
construct resolves the display of coplanar faces. A subface is introduced, after a face node, by a 
push subface control record and concluded by a pop subface control record. Note that the 
OpenFlight format does not enforce a subface to be coplanar with its superface but this is rec-
ommended. 

Light source: A light source node serves as the location and orientation of a light source. The 
light source position and direction are transformed by the transformations above it in the tree (if 
any). For more information, see “Light Source Record” on page 44. 

Sound: A sound node serves as the location for a sound emitter. The emitter position is the sound 
offset transformed by the transformations above it in the tree (if any). For more information, see 
“Sound Record” on page 43. 

Text: A text node draws text in a string with a specified font, without injecting the actual geom-
etry into the database as face nodes. This is a leaf node and therefore cannot have any children. 
For more information, see “Text Record” on page 47. 

Vertex: A vertex node represents a point in space, expressed as a double precision 3D coordi-
nates. Each vertex is stored in the vertex palette record. Vertex attributes include x, y, z and 
optionally include color, normal and texture mapping information. Vertex nodes are the children 
of face nodes and light point nodes. For more information, see “Vertex List Record” on page 39, 
“Morph Vertex List Record” on page 39 and “Vertex Palette Records” on page 66. 

Morph vertex: A morph vertex node is a second vertex node. The vertex and morph vertex rep-
resent the two endpoints of a path between which the actual vertex may be interpolated. One 
endpoint represents the minimum (non morphed) weighting and the other represents the maxi-
mum (fully morphed) weighting. Each endpoint (or weight) is a reference into the vertex palette 
record. All vertex attributes may be morphed. Morph vertex nodes are the children of face nodes.

For more information, see For more information, see “Morph Vertex List Record” on page 39. 

Clip region: A clip node defines a set of clipping planes. Any geometry, of the clip node’s chil-
dren, that falls outside the specified clipping planes is not displayed. For more information, see 
“Clip Region Record” on page 47. 

Degree of freedom: A degree of freedom (DOF) node serves as a local coordinate system with a 
predefined set of internal transformations. It specifies the articulation of parts in the database and 
set limits on the motion of those parts. For more information, see “Degree of Freedom Record” 
on page 37. 

Level of detail: A level of detail (LOD) node serves as a switch to turn the display of everything 
below it on or off based on its range from the viewer, according to its switch-in, switch-out dis-
tance and center location. For more information, see “Level of Detail Record” on page 41. 

Switch: A switch node is a more general case of an LOD node. It allows the selection of zero or 
more children by invoking a selector mask. Any combination of children can be selected per 
mask and the number of definable masks is unlimited. For more information, see “Switch 
Record” on page 49. 

External reference: An external reference node serves to reference a node in another database 
file, or an entire database file. The referenced (child) node or database is considered an external 
part of the referencing (parent) database. For more information, see “External Reference Record” 
on page 41. 

Node Attributes 

Nodes in the OpenFlight scene contain attributes whose values describe different properties or 
characteristics of the node. Most attributes are represented directly on the node itself and are 
geared toward describing the specific characteristics of that type of node. The level of detail 
(LOD) node, for example, defines a switch in and switch out distance. Used together, these dis-
tances define a range within which the geometry contained in the LOD is visible. 

Other attributes are represented indirectly on a node, using a lookup index into a table (palette) of 
attributes to describe the characteristics of a node. The face node, for example, defines several 
indirect attributes, including color index, material index and texture index. The values of these 
index attributes are used to map specific colors, materials and textures to the face node. The 
definitions of the colors, materials and textures referenced by these index attributes are stored in 
palettes in the database rather than directly on the nodes themselves. 

This mechanism of indirect attribute mapping via palettes has some advantages. It can both save 
space in the OpenFlight file and can simplify the task of making global changes to nodes in the 
database. 

To see how this indirection saves space, consider the material index attribute on the face node. A 
material is defined by over 15 separate color and other visual attributes. If each of these attributes 
were maintained per face in the database, the size of the database would get large quickly. Since 
it is common to map a single material to hundreds (or even thousands) of faces in the database, it 
is much more efficient to store a single material index attribute per face rather than storing the 
entire material definition. 

Also, in terms of changing the appearance of a particular material in your database, when you do 
change the material definition in the palette, the faces that reference that material get updated

automatically. This can make global changes much more simple to accomplish. 

Palettes 

In the previous section, indirect attribute mapping was introduced. As part of that discussion, the 
notion of database palettes was also mentioned briefly. In fact, indirect attribute mapping is not 
possible without a robust implementation of database palettes. A database palette is a collection 
(or set) of attribute definitions. As mentioned in the previous section, the material palette defines 
a set of materials, each material being composed of several different color and visual attributes.  

The OpenFlight database supports many different palettes. The most obvious palettes are the 
color, material and texture palettes. Most palettes support variable numbers of elements while 
others enforce fixed size constraints. The material and texture palettes are both variable sized 
palettes that can contain zero or more entries. The color palette, in contrast, is a fixed size palette 
that contains exactly 1024 entries. 

Database palettes are not limited to supporting indirect attribute mapping. The vertex palette for 
example, defines a set of “shared” vertex nodes that can be indirectly referenced by multiple faces 
and/or light point nodes in the database. Similar to the space savings achieved by attribute 
palettes, the vertex palette also saves much disk space in the OpenFlight file when many geom-
etry nodes share references to the same exact point in space (vertex). 

All the database palettes supported by OpenFlight are described in “Palette Records” on page 66. 
Specific palettes in OpenFlight include: 

”Color Palette Record” on page 70 
”Material Palette Record” on page 71 
”Texture Palette Record” on page 73 
”Texture Mapping Palette Record” on page 86 
”Sound Palette Record” on page 80 
”Line Style Palette Record” on page 85 
”Light Source Palette Record” on page 81 
”Light Point Appearance Palette Record” on page 82 
”Light Point Animation Palette Record” on page 85 
”Vertex Palette Records” on page 66 
”Name Table Record” on page 71 
”Eyepoint and Trackplane Palette Record” on page 73 
”Linkage Palette Record” on page 77 

Instancing 

Instancing is the ability to define all or part of a database once, then reference it one or more 
times while applying various transformations. This allows you to define a piece of geometry once 
and place it multiple times in the scene. OpenFlight supports internal and external instancing with 
operations such as Rotate, Translate, Scale, and Put. 

An internal instance is a subtree of the database that has been declared as an instance definition. 
An instance definition represents the root of a stand-alone subtree within the database. It is in-
troduced by an instance definition record that contains a unique instance definition number. An 
instance definition is invoked by an instance reference record in a subsequent part of the database

tree. 

An external instance refers to an entire database file. It is introduced by an external reference 
node. An external reference node contains the name of the (child) database file to attach to that 
point in the referencing (parent) database tree. It also includes attributes that determine whether 
the child uses its own color, material, and texture palettes, or those of its parent. 

Instance definitions can themselves contain instance definitions and references. Internal instances 
cannot reference themselves. External instances should not reference themselves directly or 
indirectly. The result of such use is undefined. 

Instance definition and instance reference records are described in “Hierarchy Instancing 
Records” on page 18. External reference records are described in “External Reference Record” on 
page 41. 

Replication 

Replication instances a subtree of the database several times, applying a transformation each 
time. For example, a string of trees can be represented by a single group node that is instantiated 
and translated to a new position several times. 

Replication is legal for group, face, and light point nodes. Therefore a replication record is an 
ancillary record of a group, face, or light point node. In conjunction with a replication record 
there will be one or more ancillary transformation records. 

Bounding Volumes 

Bounding volumes can be used by the application to determine if a particular subtree of the da-
tabase is in view. A bounding volume can be a box, a sphere, or a cylinder. Each group node can 
have only one bounding volume. The volume normally encompasses the full geometric extent of 
the group node’s children, including any instances and replications. A bounding volume record is 
an ancillary record of a group node. 

Multitexture 

OpenFlight supports eight textures per polygon or mesh as well as eight uv values per vertex. The 
texture information stored directly on the face, mesh and vertex record is referred to as “the base 
texture” or “texture layer 0”. Each additional texture layer is stored in ancillary records to the 
face, mesh and vertex list records and is referred to as “texture layer N” (for N=1..7). See 
“Multitexture” on page 54 for more information.

2 OpenFlight File Format 
The hierarchical structure of an OpenFlight database is stored on disk as a file. The file 
consists of a linear stream of binary records. Byte ordering in the file is big endian. All 
OpenFlight records begin with a 4 byte sequence. The first two bytes of this sequence 
identifies the record type (opcode) and the second two bytes specify the length of the record. 
Note that the length includes this 4 byte sequence so the minimum length of any record 
(that does not contain any additional data) will be 4. Given this very regular structure, 
OpenFlight records can be read from disk and parsed easily. 

All OpenFlight records are a multiple of 4 bytes in length. When a record contains less than an 
full multiple of 4 bytes of data, the record is padded up (bytes added to the end of the record) to 
be a multiple of 4 bytes in length. In some cases, OpenFlight records are padded up to be 
multiples of 8 bytes in length. 

The length of all records (and fields in all records) as well as the offset of all fields are expressed 
in bytes. 
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, bit fields and masks are counted starting at 0 (i.e., the first bit 

is bit number 0). 
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the elements of matrix records stored in OpenFlight appear in 

row major order. That is, the elements of the matrix appear in the following order:  
row0col0, row0col1, row0col2, row0col3, 
row1col0, row1col1, row1col2, row1col3, 
row2col0, row2col1, row2col2, row2col3, 
row3col0, row3col1, row3col2, row3col3 

The length of all OpenFlight records is limited to the largest value that can be encoded 
with 2 bytes or 16 bits (65535). For fixed-size records, this maximum size is sufficient. For 
variable-size records, this limitation is addressed with the Continuation Record. For more 
information, see “Continuation Record” on page 65. 

OpenFlight Record Types 

There are four major categories of records: control records, node primary records, 
ancillary records and continuation records. 

Control records mark the hierarchy of the tree. A push control record (a record containing 
the push opcode) indicates an increase in the depth of the tree. A push control record drops 
you down one level in the tree. A pop control record (a record containing a pop opcode) 
returns you to the previous level of hierarchy. All records between a push and a pop 
represent sibling nodes at the same level of hierarchy. Other control records include: 
instance definition, instance reference, push subface, pop subface, push attribute, and pop 
attribute. 

Each node is represented on disk by one primary record and zero or more ancillary 
records. The primary record identifies a node type and includes most of the node attribute 
data. Additional node attributes, such as comments, long ID, and transformations, are 
stored in subsequent ancillary records. Ancillary records follow the primary record, but 
precede any control records. Child nodes are introduced by a push control record and are 
concluded by a pop control record.

Palette records are ancillary records of the header node. Palette records generally follow the 
header node’s primary record, with the exception of behavior (linkage) palette records. 
Behavior palette records, if present, are the last (non-control) records in the file. 

Continuation records are used to “continue” a record in the OpenFlight Scene Description 
file stream, when the original record is larger than 65535 bytes. The continuation record 
appears in the stream immediately following the record that it “continues”. The data 
contained in the continuation record is defined by the original record and is assumed to be 
directly appended onto the content of the original record. Multiple continuation records may 
follow a record, in which case all continuation records would be appended (in sequence) to the 
original record 

Many records include an eight character ASCII ID consisting of the first seven characters 
of the node name plus a terminating <nil> character. If the node ID is longer than seven 
characters, an ancillary long ID record containing the complete ID follows the node 
primary record.  

For example, a record with an object opcode is followed by a push control record. Next 
comes a record with a face opcode, also followed by a push control record. After that comes 
the vertex list record(s) that describe the vertices of the face, and then a pop control record. 
This, in turn, may be followed by another face record for the next face in the same object, 
or by a pop record to return to object level. 

The fields within each OpenFlight record are stored in big-endian byte order. OpenFlight 
database files have the extension “.flt” by convention. 

Control Records 

Control records indicate a change in the level of the database hierarchy. The three basic 
types of control records are: level changes, instance definition, and instance reference. Level 
changes are indicated by push and pop control records. Instance definitions and references 
are indicated by instance definition and instance reference control records. 

Hierarchy Level Change Records 

A database contains three distinct types of hierarchy: generic, subface, and attribute. 
Hierarchy may be skipped by scanning past the push control record for the corresponding 
pop control record. 

Generic A push level control record introduces a generic subtree of the database 
hierarchy. A pop level control record concludes that subtree. 

Subface A push subface control record introduces a subtree of coplanar faces. A pop 
subface control record concludes that subtree. 

Extension A push extension control record introduces a subtree of user defined records. 
A pop extension control records concludes that subtree. 

Attribute A push attribute control record introduces a subtree of records reserved for 
internal use by MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc.. A pop attribute control record 
concludes that subtree.

Hierarchy Instancing Records 

An instance definition record introduces a stand-alone subtree of the database. The subtree 
is referenced one or more times from different branches in the database by instance 
reference records. At the point of reference, the subtree is copied (or possibly shared) as a 
child of the current parent node. 

The instance definition record must appear in the file stream prior to the first instance 
reference record that references it. A typical usage of these records might look like: 

INSTANCE DEFINITION 1 
PUSH  
The records between this PUSH and POP define the  
stand-alone subtree that is INSTANCE DEFINITION 1

Node Primary Records 

Header Record 

The header record is the primary record of the header node and is always the first record in 
the database file. Attributes within the header record provide important information about 
the database file as a whole. 

Format revision level indicates the OpenFlight version of the file. Correctly interpreting the 
attributes of other records, such as the face and vertex records, depends upon the format 
revision. The format revision encompasses both Flight and OpenFlight versions.

This document describes OpenFlight version 16.0, therefore the attribute descriptions are 
based upon a format revision level of 1600. 

Geographic attributes such as projection type, latitude, and longitude may be stored in the 
header record. The MultiGen Series II and Creator Terrain options set the value of these 
attributes when creating terrain databases. Positive latitudes reference the northern 
hemisphere and negative longitudes reference the western hemisphere. 

Delta x, y and z attributes indicate the placement of the database when several separate 
databases, each with a local origin of zero, are used to represent an area.

Group Record 

The group record is the primary record of the group node. Groups are the most generic 
hierarchical node present in the database tree. Attributes within the group record provide 
bounding volumes that encompass the group’s children and real-time control flags. 

Relative priority specifies a fixed ordering of the group relative to its sibling nodes. Ordering 
is from left (lesser values) to right (higher values). Nodes of equal priority may be 
arbitrarily ordered. All nodes have an implicit (default) relative priority value of zero. 

A group can represent an animation sequence in which case each immediate child of the 
group represents one frame of the sequence. An animation sequence is made of one or more 
loops.  

For a group with N children, both forward and backward loops consist of N frames. The 
frames of forward and backward loops are: 
Direction Frame 1 Frame 2 Frame 3 ... Frame N 

Forward  Child 1 Child 2 Child 3 ... Child N 
Backward  Child N Child N-1 Child N-2 ... Child 1 
  

Independent of the direction of the loop, a loop can optionally swing. A swing loop is one 
that plays its children in the primary direction and then plays them in the opposite 
direction. Note that as the loop swings from the current direction to the opposite direction, 
the last frame in the current direction is not repeated. Therefore, for a group with N 
children, the first loop of both forward swing and backward swing animations

consist of M frames where M equals ((2*N)-1) frames. Subsequent loops of swing 
animations consist of M-1 frames.  The frames of the first loop of forward and backward 
swing animations are:

Child N-

Child N-

Backward Child N Child

... Child

Child 2 Child 3 ... Child N 

The number of times an animation loop repeats within the sequence is specified by the loop 
count attribute. A loop count of 0 indicates that the loop is to repeat forever.  

The duration of one loop within the sequence is specified by the loop duration attribute and 
is measured in seconds. A loop duration of 0 indicates that the loop is to play as fast as 
possible.  

For finite animation sequences (those with positive, non-zero loop count values), the 
duration that the last frame of the last loop is extended after the sequence has finish is 
specified by the last frame duration attribute and is measured in seconds. A last frame 
duration of 0 indicates that the last frame is not displayed any longer after the sequence 
finishes.  

Special effect ID1 and ID2 are application-defined attributes. Their values can be used to 
enhance the meaning of existing attributes, such as the animation flags, or extend the 
interpretation of the group node. Normally, the value of these attributes is zero. 

Significance can be used to assist real-time culling and load balancing mechanisms, by 
defining the visual significance of this group with respect to other groups in the database. 
Normally the value of this attribute is zero. 

Layer ID is used by the Instrumentation Tools in the modeling products to identify (for 
display) a collection of groups, independent of their locations in the hierarchy. Normally the 
value of this attribute is zero.

Object Record 

The object record is the primary record of the object node. Objects are low-level grouping 
nodes that contain attributes pertaining to the state of it child geometry. Only face and light 
point nodes may be the children of object nodes.

The time-of-day object flags can be used to inhibit the display of certain objects, depending 
on the current time of day. 

The illumination flag, when set, makes an object self-illuminating, and is not subject to 
lighting calculations. In practice, geometric normals should be ignored. 

The flat shading flag, when set, indicates that lighting calculations should produce a faceted 
appearance to the object’s geometry. In practice, geometric normals should be constrained 
to face normals. 

The shadow flag indicates the object represents the shadow of the rest of the group. When 
used as part of a moving model (e.g., an aircraft), the application can apply appropriate 
distortions, creating a realistic shadow on the terrain or runway. 

Relative priority specifies a fixed ordering of the object relative to its sibling nodes. Ordering 
is from left (lesser values) to right (higher values). Nodes of equal priority may be 
arbitrarily ordered. All nodes have an implicit (default) value of zero. 

When used, transparency applies to all an object’s children (geometry). The value should be 
modulated with the transparency of the geometry and material alpha calculation, as 
described in the Face Record, Mesh Record and Material Record sections. 

Note: The MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. modeling environment does not use the object 
transparency value for rendering as described above. 

However, when an object’s transparency value is set in Creator, that value is set on all children 
faces of the object. Runtime applications may choose to use the transparency value at the object 
level at their discretion.

Face Record 

The face record is the primary record of the face node. A face contains attributes describing 
the visual state of its child vertices. Only vertex and morph vertex nodes may be children of 
faces. This should not be confused with the fact that faces may have subfaces. 

If a face contains a non-negative material index, its apparent color is a combination of the 
face color and material color, as described in “Material Palette Record” on page 71. If a face 
contains a nonaddictive material with an alpha component and the transparency field is set, 
the total transparency is the product of the material alpha and face transparency.  

Note: As mentioned in “Object Record” on page 25, the object transparency is not used in the 
MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. modeling environment to determine the actual transparency 
value of a face. 

If a face is a unidirectional or bidirectional light point, the face record is followed by a 
vector record (Vector Opcode 50) that contains the unit vector indicating the direction in 
which the primary color is displayed. For bidirectional light points, the alternate color is 
displayed in the opposite direction (180 degrees opposed). 

Note: This method of defining light points is obsolete after OpenFlight version 15.2. Such light 
point faces will be turned into the new light point record when it is read into MultiGen II 
v1.4 or later.  

Relative priority specifies a fixed ordering of the face relative to its sibling nodes. Ordering 
is from left (lesser values) to right (higher values). Nodes of equal priority may be 
arbitrarily ordered. All nodes have an implicit (default) value of zero.

Mesh Nodes 

A mesh node defines a set of geometric primitives that share attributes and vertices. Prior to 
OpenFlight version 15.7, the fundamental geometric construct was the face (polygon) which 
was represented by a unique set of attributes and vertices. Meshes, by contrast, represent 
“sets” of related polygons, each sharing common attributes and vertices. Using a mesh, 
related polygons can be represented in a much more compact format. Each mesh consists of 
one set of “polygon” attributes (color, material, texture, etc.), a common “vertex pool” and 
one or more geometric primitives that use the shared attributes and vertices. Using a mesh, 
you can represent triangle strips, triangle fans, quadrilateral strips and indexed face sets. 

A mesh node is defined by three distinct record types:  

Mesh Record - defines the “polygon” attributes associated to all geometric primitives of the 
mesh.  
Local Vertex Pool Record - defines the set of vertices that are referenced by the geometric 

primitives of the mesh.  
Mesh Primitive Record - defines a geometric primitive (triangle-strip, triangle-fan, 

quadrilateral-strip or indexed face set) for the mesh.  
A mesh node consists of one mesh record, one local vertex pool record, and one or more 
mesh primitive records. The mesh primitive records are delimited by push and pop control 
records as shown in the following example:  
MESH 
LOCAL VERTEX POOL 
PUSH   
MESH PRIMITIVE   
MESH PRIMITIVE   
...   
MESH PRIMITIVE   
POP

Mesh Record 

The mesh record is the primary record of a mesh node and defines the common “face-like” 
attributes associated to all geometric primitives of the mesh. These attributes are identical 
to those of the face record. See “Face Record” on page 26.

This record defines a set of vertices that is referenced by the geometry (primitives) of the 
mesh.

Each mesh primitive is represented using the Mesh Primitive record above. The following 
descriptions explain how the vertices of each primitive type are interpreted as geometry: 
 Triangle Strip - This mesh primitive defines a connected group of triangles in the context of 

the enclosing mesh. Each triangle shares the “polygon” attributes defined by the enclosing 
mesh. This primitive contains a sequence of indices that reference vertices from the local 
vertex pool. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first two vertices. For 
odd n, vertices n, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. For even n, vertices n+1, n, and n+2 define 
triangle n. The first triangle is n=1. The first vertex in the vertex pool is n=1. N vertices 
represent N-2 triangles. 

 Triangle Fan - Like the Triangle Strip, this mesh primitive also defines a connected group of 
triangles in the context of the enclosing mesh. Each triangle shares the “polygon” attributes 
defined by the enclosing mesh. This primitive contains a sequence of indices that reference 
vertices from the local vertex pool. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the 
first two vertices. Vertices 1, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. The first triangle is n=1. The 
first vertex in the vertex pool is n=1. N vertices represent N-2 triangles. 

 Quadrilateral Strip - This mesh primitive defines a connected group of quadrilaterals in the 
context of the enclosing mesh. Each quadrilateral shares the “polygon” attributes defined by 
the enclosing mesh. This primitive contains a sequence of indices that reference vertices from 
the local vertex pool. One quadrilateral is defined for each pair of vertices presented after the 
first pair. Vertices 2n-1, 2n, 2n+2, and 2n+1 define quadrilateral n. The first quadrilateral is 
n=1. The first vertex in the vertex pool is n=1. N vertices represent (N/2)-1 quadrilaterals. 

 Indexed Polygon -This mesh primitive defines a single polygon in the context of the 
enclosing mesh. This primitive is similar to the other mesh primitives in that it also shares the 
polygon attributes of the enclosing mesh. It is different from the other mesh primitive types in 
that while triangle strips/fans and quadrilateral strips describe a set of connected 
triangles/quadrilaterals, the indexed polygon defines a single polygon. This primitive contains 
a sequence of indices that reference vertices from the local vertex pool. One polygon is 
defined by the sequence of vertices in this record. N vertices represent 1 N-sided closed 
polygon or 1 (N-1)-sided unclosed polygon. 

Light Point Nodes 

The OpenFlight format supports two kinds of light point records, indexed and inline. In 
indexed light point records, the attributes are stored in two palettes; the light point 
appearance palette and the light point animation palette. The indexed light point record 
simply stores indices into these two palettes. In inline light point records, all the attributes 
are stored directly in the light point record itself. This section describes both of these 
records.

Indexed Light Point Record 

The indexed light point record is one of the records that can represent a light point node. 

The appearance index specifies an entry in the light point appearance palette that contains 
the visual attributes of the light point. 

The animation index specifies an entry in the light point animation palette that contains the 
behavioral attributes of the light point. 

The palette entries referenced by the indexed light point record describe the visual state of 
the light point’s child vertices. Only vertex nodes may be children of light point nodes.

Light Point Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Light Point 
Records.   

The light point record is one of the records that can represent a light point node. The light 
point record contains attributes describing the visual state of its child vertices. Only vertex 
nodes may be children of light point nodes. 

Light points are geometric points that represent real world light sources such as runway 
lights, vehicle lights, street lights, and rotating beacons. Light points differ from light 
sources in that they do not illuminate the scene around them. They are primarily used to 
model important visual cues without incurring the tremendous rendering overhead 
associated with light sources.  

Most light point attributes are specific to these unique requirements. Light points can be 
displayed on special purpose calligraphic imaging systems, the more familiar raster variety, 
or even hybrid raster/calligraphic (RASCAL) systems.

Degree of Freedom Record 

The degree of freedom (DOF) record is the primary record of the DOF node. The DOF 
node specifies a local coordinate system and the range allowed for translation, rotation, and 
scale with respect to that coordinate system. 

The DOF record can be viewed as a series of applied transformations consisting of the 
following elements: 

[PTTTRRRSSSP] 

where “P” denotes “put,” “T” denotes “translate,” “R” denotes “rotate,” and “S” denotes 
“scale.” 

It is important to understand the order in which these transformations are applied to the 
geometry. A pre-multiplication is assumed, so the sequence of transformations must be read 
from right to left, in order to describe its effect on the geometry contained below the DOF. 
In this manner, a DOF is interpreted as a Put followed by three Scales, three Rotates, three 
Translates, and a Put. 

Taking the transformations in right to left order, they represent: 

1. A Put (3 point to 3 point transformation). This matrix brings the DOF coordinate system to 
the world origin, with its x-axis aligned along the world x-axis and its y-axis in the world x-y 
plane. Testing against the DOF's constraints is performed in this standard position. This 
matrix is therefore the inverse of the last (see step 11 below). 

2. Scale in x. 
3. Scale in y.

5. Rotation about z (yaw). 
6. Rotation about y (roll). 
7. Rotation about x (pitch). 
8. Translation in x. 
9. Translation in y. 
10. Translation in z. 
11. A final Put. This matrix moves the DOF coordinate system back to its original position in the 

scene.  
The DOF record specifies the minimum, maximum, and current values for each 
transformation. Only the current value affects the actual transformation applied to the 
geometry. The increment value specifies discrete allowable values within the range of 
legal values represented by the DOF.

Vertex List Record 

A vertex list record is the primary record of a vertex node. Each record references one or 
more vertices in the vertex palette. See “Vertex Palette Records” on page 66. A vertex node is

Morph Vertex List Record 

A morph vertex list record is the primary record of a morph vertex node. Like the vertex 
list record, each morph vertex list record references one or more vertices in the vertex 
palette. See: “Vertex Palette Records” on page 66. A morph vertex node is a leaf node in the 
database and therefore cannot have any children. 

Each record references one or more pairs of vertices (weights) in the vertex palette. One 
weight is the 0 percent morph attributes and the other weight is the 100 percent morph 
attributes. Since each weight references a vertex, all vertex attributes including color, 
normal, and texture coordinates may be morphed. 

When the eyepoint approaches the switch-in distance, the vertex attributes displayed are 
100 percent morphed. When the eyepoint reaches the distance computed by LOD switch-in 
distance minus LOD transition range, the vertex attributes displayed are 0 percent 
morphed. Within the LOD transition range, the vertex attributes displayed are interpolated 
between the two known vertex attributes. 

Geometric morphing is controlled by the parent LOD node. Only morph vertex nodes are 
affected. Both morphing and static geometry (vertices) may exist within the same branch of 
the database hierarchy.

Binary Separating Plane Record 

The binary separating plane (BSP) record is the primary record of the BSP node. A BSP 
allows you to model 3D databases without depth (Z) buffer support. 

An application uses this information to cull portions of the database according to which side 
of the plane the subtree is situated on with regard to eyepoint position and viewing 
direction. 

This record contains an equation ax + by + cz + d = 0 that describes the separating plane.

External Reference Record 

The external reference record is the primary record of the external reference node. 
External references allow one database to reference, or instance, a node in another database 
(or an entire database). At the point of reference, the referenced node/database is copied (or 
possibly shared) as a child of the current parent node. 

The override flags allow the referencing (parent) database to control use of the referenced 
(child) node/database palettes. If an override flag (e.g., material) is set, the child 
node/database uses its own (material) palette. Otherwise, the child node/database uses the 
current (parent’s) palette. The override flags are hierarchical and may affect references 
made by the child node/database. 

The view as bounding box field is used by the MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. modeling 
environment and is not expected to be used by runtime applications.

Level of Detail Record 

The level of detail (LOD) record is the primary record of the LOD node. LOD’s are perhaps 
the most important hierarchical node present in the database tree. Proper use of level-of-
detail modeling concepts can vastly improve real-time playback of large databases. 
Attributes within the LOD record provide switching and transition distances for real-time 
culling and load management mechanisms. 

The center coordinate can be used by a real-time application to calculate the slant range 
distance from the eyepoint to the LOD. Based upon the result of this calculation, a real-time 
application can choose not to display the LOD’s children and thus reduce system load. The 
center of the LOD is generally the transformed center of the geometry of the LOD’s 
children. This should include the effects of instancing and (parent) group replication as 
well. 

The use previous slant range flag indicates that the slant range for this LOD is the same as 
the previous (sibling) LOD, implying the center coordinate is also the same. The real-time 
application can reuse the previous slant range calculation when evaluating this LOD, 
thereby improving performance. 

If the freeze center flag is not set, the MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. modeling environment as 
well as OpenFlight API based applications will recalculate the center point of the LOD 
when the OpenFlight file is saved. 

Transition range specifies the range over which real-time smoothing effects should be 
employed while switching from one LOD to another. Smoothing effects include geometric 
morphing and image blending. The smoothing effect is active between: switch-in distance 
minus transition range (near), and switch-in distance (far). The center distance of the effect 
is therefore switch-in distance minus one half the transition range. 

Significant size is a value used to calculate switch in and out distances based on viewing pa-
rameters of your simulation display system. This value is used internally by MultiGen-
Paradigm and will be enhanced in future versions of OpenFlight.

Sound Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Sound 
Records.  

The sound record is the primary record of the sound node. A sound node represents the 
position and orientation of a sound emitter in the database. 

Amplitude and pitch blend are relative to the amplitude in the waveform file. Falloff defines 
how amplitude falls off when approaching the edge of the sound lobe, with maximum 
amplitude at the center of the lobe. 

Priority determines which sounds are played when more emitters populate a scene than the 
sound system can play simultaneously. 

Width defines the half angle of the sound lobe. Direction sets the type of sound lobe.  

Doppler, absorption, and delay flags enable or disable the modeling of Doppler, atmospheric 
absorption, and propagation delay in the sound environment. 

Active indicates a sound is to be activated when read in to the modeling environment.

Light Source Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Light 
Source Records.  

The light source record is the primary record of the light source node. Light sources 
illuminate the database. They contain position and rotation data (overriding any 
information stored in the light palette), an index into the light palette, and information on 
how the light behaves within the hierarchy.  

The enabled flag indicates whether the light is turned on and, therefore, a factor of the 
lighting (rendering) model. 

The global flag specifies whether the light shines on the entire database or only on its 
children (for example, the cabin light in a car).

Road Segment Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Road 
Segment Records.  

A road segment record is the primary record of a road segment node. It stores the 
attributes used to create and modify a road segment. The children of the road node 
represent the geometry and paths of the road and should not be manually edited. Any 
modification invalidates the road segment.

Road Construction Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Road 
Construction Records.  

A road construction record is the primary record of a road construction node. It supersedes 
the Road Segment Record described previously. It is created by the Pathfinder option of 
MultiGen II Pro v1.5 as well as the Road Tool option beginning with Creator v2.1. It stores 
the parameters defining the road path construction for one road section. In practice, the 
children of the road construction node usually represent the geometry and paths of the road 
section. Although every field in the road construction record may be modified, this data 
makes the most sense when it is kept in sync with the geometry that is created from it. 
Therefore, typical usage will be read-only access from applications able to analyze the road 
surface from this given data. 

The Road type field dictates how the following fields define the current road section. For all 
road types, the Entry and Exit control points lie on the boundaries of the road section. The 
Alignment control point is only necessary for the Curve type as it defines a horizontal 
tangent with the other control points. 

Other fields particular to the Curve type are the horizontal curve parameters. The 
horizontal components of the Curve type start and end with spiral transitions of specified 
lengths. An Arc Radius length is used to define the constant curve area. The Superelevation 
is specified in a rise over run slope measured laterally across the road for the maximum 
banking which is used throughout the constant curve component. The banking transitions 
along the spiral sections in one of three ways defined by the Spiral type field. 

Both the Curve and Hill types may have a vertical curve component defined by the 
remaining fields. Slopes are given at both the entry and exit of the section. If the given 
slopes don't intersect within the road segment then two vertical parabolas are constructed 
instead of one, and the Additional vertical parabola flag is set. Note that this flag’s value is 
only valid when the Road Tools version field is 3 or later. This flag may also be set when 
convergence of the slopes creates a vertical curve length less than Minimum curve length.

Otherwise, Vertical curve length is used to define the horizontal distance covered by the 
single parabola vertical curve.

Path Records.  

A road path record is the primary record of a road path node. A road path node is a child 
of a road segment node. It describes a lane of the parent road segment. The child of a road 
path node is a face node whose vertices provide the coordinates of the center of the lane. 

Road path record attributes may also be written to an ASCII file for easy access by the 
application. The format of the file is described in “Road Path Files,” page 99.

Clip Region Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Clip 
Region Records.  

A clip region record is the primary record of a clip node. It defines those regions in 3D 
space in which drawing occurs. Clip regions only clip the geometry below the clip node in 
the hierarchy. 

The coordinates create a four-sided face that defines the clip region in space. Planes are 
formed along the edges of the four-sided face normal to the face; a fifth plane clips the back 
side of the face.

Switch Record 

A switch record is the primary record of a switch node. A switch represents a set of masks 
that control the display of the switch’s children. 

Each mask contains one bit for each child of the switch. Each mask bit indicates that the 
corresponding child is selected (1) or deselected (0). Each mask selects some, none, or all of 
the children for display according to the state of the mask bits. 

Both the switch children and mask bits begin counting from 0. Therefore the selection state, 
for a particular switch child is derived from a given mask with the following calculation: 

mask_bit = 1 << (child_num % 32) 

mask_word = mask_words [mask_num * num_words + child_num / 32] 

child_selected = mask_word & mask_bit 

The current mask value is an index into the set of masks and indicates the selected mask. 

The masks of a switch node can be named. These names are stored in the ancillary record, 
indexed string record. See “Indexed String Record” on page 53.

CAT Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider CAT Records.  

A continuously adaptive terrain 
(CAT) record is the primary record of a 
CAT node. A continuously adaptive 
terrain skin is a hierarchical triangle 
mesh designed for high fidelity, real- time 
viewing. A CAT skin is represented in 
OpenFlight by a record stream 
consisting of: a CAT record, a set of 
CAT data records, a push record, the 
CAT hierarchy and geometry, and a pop 
record. CAT hierarchy and geometry is 
represented by standard OpenFlight 
constructs of LOD’s, groups, external 
references, faces, and vertices.

Extension Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider 
Extension Records.  

An extension node record is the primary record of an extension node. It introduces a user 
defined node type that is defined by an extension site that utilizes the extensibility of the 
OpenFlight format. It specifies the site information for a third party record which contains 
additional data that is not represented by the standard OpenFlight records. The content of 
the data itself is transparent to users other than the extension site. The data can be accessed 
by the combination of the OpenFlight API and the data dictionary defined by the extension 
site.  

The relationship of an extension node relative to other hierarchical nodes is defined by the 
standard push and pop control records. For more information about extensions, please 
refer to the “OpenFlight API User’s Guide, Level 3: Extensions”. 

The extension record (Opcode 100) may also introduce new attributes to existing nodes (See 
“Extension Attribute Record” on page 64.)

Curve Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Curve Records.  

A curve record is the primary record of a curve node. A curve node represents one or more 
curve segments joined together with at least G0 continuity. Let a curve segment be defined 
by 4 geometric constraints. We will call these geometric constraints control points in the 
curve record. The way the control points are grouped and used will be discussed below.  

Let each control point be a double precision 3D coordinate, P = (x, y, z). 

Let the group of control points be (P0, P1,..., Pk). 

The currently defined curve types are B-spline, Cardinal, and Bezier. 

If the curve type is Bezier, P0, P1, P2, and P3 form the first curve segment. P3, P4, P5, and P6 
form the next segment, and so on. Notice that the last control point in the first segment 
becomes the first control point in the second segment. 

If the curve type is either B-spline or Cardinal, P0, P1, P2, and P3 form the first curve 
segment. P1, P2, P3, and P4 from the next segment, and so on. Notice that the second control 
point in the first segment becomes the first control point in the second segment. 

Note that the smoothness of the curve depends on how many times your renderer samples 
the curve equation into piece-wise linear elements. In the MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. 
modeling environment, each curve segment is evenly sampled 11 times to produce 10 lines 
per curve segment.

Ancillary records follow node primary records. They contain supplementary attribute data for the 
node they follow. Ancillary records are optional but must precede any control record, following the 
node primary record, when present, as shown in this example:  
GROUP 
COMMENT 
LONG ID 
PUSH

In this example, the comment and long ID ancillary records apply to the group record. There is no 
order dependency between ancillary records. The comment could appear before or after the long ID 
record in the example above, but must appear before any control record. 

Comment Record 

A comment record is an ancillary record that contains text data that belongs to the preceding node 
primary record. The text description is a variable length ASCII string terminated by a <nil>

Note that the ID field found in third field of every primary OpenField record must be 
unique.  The ID itself can be in Short or Long form.  In Short form, the ID is limited to a 
7 char ASCII string.  In Long form, the ID can be of up to (64K – 5) characters in length.  
The Long ID record, when present, replaces the 7 char string found in the third of the 
primary record.

An indexed string record is an ancillary record that contains an integer index followed by a variable

Currently, indexed string records are only used in the context of switch nodes, for which they 
represent the names of the masks contained in the switch node. The index specifies the mask number 
for which the string specifies the name. Mask numbers start at 0. Not all masks are required to have 
names.

Multitexture 

OpenFlight supports eight textures per polygon or mesh as well as eight uv values per vertex. The 
current texture information stored on the polygon is referred to as “the base texture” or “texture 
layer 0”. Each additional texture is referred to as “texture layer N”. Therefore, to support eight 
textures per polygon, a base texture is required as well as seven additional texture layers. Not all 
layers are required. Nor is any mandate set forth requiring that layers be contiguous after the base 
layer. The additional texture layers for each polygon, mesh, and vertex are represented in ancillary 
records at the face, mesh and vertex primary node level as shown in the following example:  
FACE  
MULTITEXTURE  
PUSH  
VERTEX LIST  
UV LIST  
POP  
The records that are used to represent multitexture in the OpenFlight file are described in the 
following sections.

UV List Record 

The uv list record is an ancillary record of vertex nodes. This record (if present) always 
follows the vertex list or morph vertex list record and contains texture layer information for 
the vertices represented in the vertex list record it follows.

The following fields are repeated for each vertex contained in the corresponding vertex list or 
morph vertex list record. 

If this uv list record follows a vertex list record, the following fields are repeated for each layer 
present (as specified by the bits set in Attribute mask). 

Data Type Offset Length 
Float 4 ui, N - Texture coordinate U for vertex i, layer N 
Float 4  vi, N - Texture coordinate V for vertex i, layer N 
The number of vertices represented in the uv list record that follows a vertex list record must be 
identical to the number of vertices contained in that vertex list record. This number can also be 
calculated as follows:  

Number of vertices = (Length - 8) / (8 * X), where X is the number of bits set in Attribute mask.  

If this uv list record follows a morph vertex list record, the following fields are repeated for each 
layer present (as specified by the bits set in Attribute mask).

Again, the number of vertices represented in the uv list record that follows a morph vertex list 
record must be identical to the number of vertices contained in that morph vertex list record. This 
number can also be calculated as follows:  

Number of vertices = (Length - 8) / (16 * X), where X is the number of bits set in Attribute mask.

Replicate Record 

A replicate record is an ancillary record of group, face, and light (string) point nodes. It 
indicates the number of times the group, face, or light (string) point is instantiated. An 
ancillary transformation record must also be present. The transformation is iteratively 
applied to each instance to uniquely place it in the database.

Transformation Records.  The Rotate About Edge Record, Translate Record, Scale Record, Rotate About 
Point Record, Rotate and/or Scale to Point Record, Put Record and General Matrix Record are specific to 
the MultiGen Creator tool; as a result, CDB OpenFlight readers do not consider them. 

Transformation records may be ancillary records of most nodes. All hierarchical nodes may

be transformed except the header node. Some nodes may only be transformed implicitly, as 
part of some other operation, such as point replication within a light point string. 

There are several distinct types of transformation records. For a transformation applied to 
any node, a matrix record is always present and represents the final (composite) 
transformation. When present, the transformation records that follow a matrix record 
represent the individual transformations applied to the node. If an application only needs 
the final transformation, the matrix record is sufficient and the transformation records that 
follow the matrix record can be ignored. The records following the matrix record are only 
needed by the application if it needs to decompose the transformation. The MultiGen-
Paradigm, Inc. modeling environment uses these records in order to allow the modeler to 
modify any of the discrete transformations applied to a node. 

Again, each record that follows the matrix record represents a discrete transformation that 
has been concatenated to form the composite matrix. Concatenation is done in the order 
that the records are encountered, using pre-multiplication. 

Note: The final and general matrices are only single-precision, while the discrete transformations 
are double-precision.

Bounding Volume Records 

Bounding volumes are ancillary records for group nodes only. They generally encompass all 
the geometry of a group’s children. A bounding volume may describe a box, sphere, 
cylinder, convex hull or histogram. 

The center coordinate of a bounding volume is stored as a separate record. The orientation 
of a bounding volume is also stored as a separate record. The convex hull data is 
represented by a sequence of triangles forming the convex hull around the group geometry. 

Applications may use the bounding volume information with culling and collision detection 
algorithms.

CAT Data Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider CAT Records.  

The CAT data records contain the information needed to reconstruct a Continuously 
Adaptive Terrain skin from its OpenFlight representation. They provide the information 
which links faces between levels of detail within a CAT skin. CAT data is stored as a key 
table with an opcode of 116. For specific detail please refer to “Key Table Records” on 
page 76. 

Each CAT data record describes how a face within a CAT skin is related to faces at the next 
finer level of detail. The coarsest level of detail is level zero. The next finer level of detail is 
one, and so forth. Each data record is stored in the key table using an ordinal key, counting 
up from zero. The face node ID is stored in the data record, thereby providing the cross 
reference to the OpenFlight face node that represents it. 

In OpenFlight, each CAT level of detail is parented by a LOD node. Each CAT triangle 
strip is parented by a group node.

Extension Attribute Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider Extension Attribute 
Records.  

The extension attribute record is an ancillary record defined by an extension site that 
utilizes the extensibility of the OpenFlight format. It specifies the site information of a third 
party extended record which describes additional data that is not represented by the 
standard OpenFlight records. The data itself is transparent to users other than the 
extension site. The data can be accessed by the combination of the OpenFlight API and the 
data dictionary defined by the extension site.  

Any hierarchical node can contain extension attribute records. Extension attributes are 
introduced by an push extension control record and concluded by a pop extension control 
record. 

The extension record (Opcode 100) may also introduce a new node type (See “Extension 
Record” on page 51.)

Unsigned Int 22 2 Record code - site specific 
Char 24 Variable Extended data - site specific 

Continuation Record 

All OpenFlight records begin with a 4 byte sequence. The first two bytes identify the record 
(opcode) and the second two bytes specify the length of the record. Given this regular 
record structure, the length of all OpenFlight records is limited to the largest value that can 
be encoded with 2 bytes or 16 bits (65535). For fixed-size records, this maximum size is 
sufficient. For variable-size records, this limitation is addressed with the continuation 
record which is described in this section. 

The continuation record accommodates variable size records in the OpenFlight Scene 
Description. The continuation record is used to “continue” a record in the OpenFlight file 
stream. It appears in the stream immediately following the record that it “continues” (the 
record that is being continued will be referred to as the “original” record). In this way, the 
continuation record is an ancillary record to any other record type. The data contained in 
the continuation record is defined by the original record and is assumed to be directly 
appended onto the content of the original record.  

Note: Multiple continuation records may follow a record, in which case all continuation 
records would be appended (in sequence) to the original record.

ü 

In theory, any OpenFlight record may be “continued”, but in practice only variable length 
records, whose length is likely to exceed 65535 bytes, are. Following is a list of the variable 
length OpenFlight record types to which the continuation record is likely to apply:  

 “Extension Record” on page 51  
 “Name Table Record” on page 71  
 “Local Vertex Pool Record” on page 30

Example: In the following example, the color name table is “too” big to fit in 65535 bytes so 
the primary palette record, NAME TABLE, is followed by one (or more) CONTINUATION 
records. The contents of each of the continuation records is appended to the contents of the 
name table record before the name table data is parsed.

Palette Records 

Palette records are ancillary records of the header node. They contain attribute data 
globally shared by other nodes in the database. Other nodes, such as face nodes, reference 
the palette data by index. 

Individual palettes contain resources such as vertex, material, light source, texture pattern, 
and line style definitions. 

Vertex Palette Records 

Double precision vertex records are stored in a vertex palette for the entire database. 
Vertices shared by one or more geometric entities are written only one time in the vertex 
palette. This reduces the overall size of the OpenFlight file by writing only “unique” 
vertices. Vertex palette records are referenced by faces and light points via vertex list and 
morph vertex list records. See “Vertex List Record” on page 39 and “Morph Vertex List 
Record” on page 39 for more information.  

Note: The vertices referenced by mesh nodes are not contained in vertex palette records. 
Instead, they are contained in local vertex pool records. See “Local Vertex Pool Record” on 
page 30. The vertex palette record signifies the start of the vertex palette. It contains a one 
word entry specifying the total length of the vertex palette, which is equal to the length of 
this header record plus the length of the following vertex records. The individual vertex 
records follow this header, each starting with its own opcode. The length field in the vertex 
palette record makes it possible to skip over vertex records until the data is actually needed. 

As stated above, vertices may be shared, and are accessed through the vertex and morph 
vertex list records following each face record. A face may contain all morph vertices, all 
non-morph vertices, or a mixture of both. Thus there can be one or more list records 
following each face. Consecutive vertices with the same type are grouped together within a 
list record. The length of each list record is determined by the number of consecutive 
vertices of each type. For each vertex, there is a one word field pointing to its vertex record 
in the vertex palette. Since this offset includes the length of the vertex palette record, the 
value of the first pointer is 8.

database. 

The Color name index references a name in the color name palette.

The Hard edge flag indicates this vertex starts an edge that is to be preserved by polygon 
reduction or decimation algorithms. 

The Normal frozen flag indicates the normal is not to be updated by shading or lighting 
algorithms. 

The No color flag indicates the vertex does not have a color. If set, neither the Packed color 
or Vertex color index fields are defined. 

When a vertex has a color (the No color flag is not set), the Packed color field is always 
specified (regardless of the value of the Packed color flag) and contains the red, green, blue 
and alpha color components. For alpha, 0 represents fully transparent, 255 fully opaque. If 
the Packed color flag is set, the Vertex color index field will be undefined. 

Here are some examples that show how vertex palette records can represent vertex colors:

Color Palette Record 

The color palette record contains all colors indexed by face and vertex nodes in the 
database. 

The color record is divided into two sections: one for color entries and one for color names. 
All color entries are in 32-bit packed format (a, b, g, r). Each color consists of red, green, 
and blue components of 8 bits each, plus 8 bits reserved for alpha (future). Currently alpha 
is always 0xff (fully opaque). The color entry section consists of 1024 ramped colors of 128 
intensities each. 

The color name section may or may not be included. If the length of the color palette record 
is greater than 4228, then you can assume that the color name section is included. When it is 
present, the color name section consists of a header followed by 0 or more color name 
entries. The header contains the number of names in the palette. If this value is 0, there are 
no names following in the palette. Each color name entry contains the name string, pointer 
to the associated color entry, and other reserved information. The name field is a variable-
length, null-terminated ASCII string, with a maximum of 80 bytes.

Name Table Record 

The name table contains a lookup table of names referenced within the database. These 
names are typically used as attributes (e.g., color name index in the face record). The 
primary benefit of the name table is to allow name referencing, so each name string is only 
stored once. Each name entry in the name table contains fields for the its length, index, and 
string. The name index is used by the database to reference names within the table. The 
name string is a variable-length, null-terminated ASCII string, with a maximum of 80 
bytes.

Material Palette Record 

The material palette contains descriptions of materials used while drawing geometry. It is 
composed of an arbitrary number of material palette records. The material palette records 
must follow the header record and precede the first push. 

The appearance of a face or mesh in OpenFlight is a combination of the geometry (face or 
mesh) color and the material properties. The geometry color is factored into the material 
properties as follows: 

Ambient: 
The displayed material's ambient component is the product of the ambient component of 
the material and the geometry color: 

Displayed ambient (red) = Material ambient (red)* geometry color (red) 
Displayed ambient (green) = Material ambient (green)* geometry color (green) 
Displayed ambient (blue) = Material ambient (blue)* geometry color (blue) 

For example, suppose the material has an ambient component of {1.0,.5,.5} and the 
geometry color is {100, 100, 100}. The displayed material has as its ambient color {100, 50, 
50}. 

Diffuse: 
As with the ambient component, the diffuse component is the product of the diffuse 
component of the material and the geometry color: 

Displayed diffuse (red) = Material diffuse (red)* geometry color (red) 
Displayed diffuse (green) = Material diffuse (green)* geometry color (green) 
Displayed diffuse (blue) = Material diffuse (blue)* geometry color (blue) 

Specular: 
Unlike ambient and diffuse components, the displayed specular component is taken directly 
from the material: 

Displayed specular (red) = Material specular (red) 
Displayed specular (green) = Material specular (green) 
Displayed specular (blue) = Material specular (blue)

Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014 
 

 
300 

© 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

Emissive: 
The displayed emissive component is taken directly from the material: 

Displayed emissive (red) = Material emissive (red) 
Displayed emissive (green) = Material emissive (green) 
Displayed emissive (blue) = Material emissive (blue) 

Shininess: 
The MultiGen-Paradigm, Inc. modeling environment uses the shininess directly from the 
material. Specular highlights are tighter, with higher shininess values. 

Alpha: 
An alpha of 1.0 is fully opaque, while 0.0 is fully transparent. The final alpha applied is a 
combination of the transparency value of the geometry (face or mesh) with the alpha value 
of the material record. The final alpha value is a floating point number between 0.0 
(transparent) and 1.0 (opaque), and is computed as follows: 

Final alpha = material alpha * (1.0 - (geometry transparency / 65535))

Texture Palette Record 

There is one record for each texture pattern referenced in the database. These records must

is made up of 256 patterns. The pattern index for the first palette is 0 - 255, for the second 
palette 256 - 511, etc. Note: If less than 256 patterns exist on a palette, several pattern 
indices are unused. The x and y palette locations are used to store offset locations in the 
palette for display.

Key Table Records 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Key Table 
Records.  

Key table records store variable length data records and their identifiers. The linkage 
editor, sound palette, and CAT Data are stored as key table records. The first key table 
record contains the key table header and a set of keys. If all the keys cannot fit into the first 
record, additional key records are written. This is followed by one or more key table data 

records.  

A key table consists of: For an example of the use of key table records, see “Sound Palette 
Record” on page 108.

Linkage Palette Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Linkage Palette 
Records.  

Database linkages use key table records. Linkage data consists of two different constructs: 
nodes and arcs. Nodes usually contain data pertaining to database entities such as DOFs. In 
addition, the nodes may represent modeling driver functions and code nodes. The arcs 
contain information on how all the nodes are connected to each other. For most nodes, the 
value of the node is contained in the following Entity name subrecord. For example, this 
node value can be a node name, when the node represents a database entity, or a math 
formula as a string, in the case of a formula node. Names are stored as null-terminated 
ASCII strings. 

See “Linkage Editor Parameter IDs” on page 103 for parameter ID values and descriptions.

Sound Palette Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Sound Palette 
Records.  

The sound palette uses key table records to store the sound index and file name. The index 
is the key value, and the file name is the data record, formatted as a null-terminated ASCII 
string. The sound palette header record indicates the number of sounds associated with the 
database.

Light Source Palette Record 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Light Source 
Records.  

These records represent entries in the light source palette. Entries are referenced by light 
source nodes using the palette index. Lights can be flagged as modeling lights, which 
illuminate a scene without being stored as part of the hierarchy. A modeling light is always 
positioned at the eye; its direction is stored in the palette. A light referenced by a node 
obtains its position and direction from the node. In this case, the palette yaw and pitch 
components are ignored.

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Line Style 
Palette Records.  

Line style records define the outline displayed around faces in wireframe or wireframe-
over-solid mode. The Pattern field defines a mask to control the display of segments of the 
line. For example, if all the bits of the mask are set, the line is drawn as a solid line. If every 
other bit is on, the line is displayed as a dashed line. The Line Width field controls the width 
of the line in pixels. Line style 0 is the default. Faces are assigned line styles in the Line Style 
field of the face record. One of these records appears for each line style defined in the 
OpenFlight file.

3 Texture Files 

Texture Pattern Files 

OpenFlight does not have its own texture pattern format, but rather uses existing 
texture formats and references patterns by file name. See “Texture Palette Record” on 
page 73.  

File formats currently supported include: 

AT&T® image 8 format (8-bit color lookup) CDB OpenFlight 
Readers 

AT&T image 8 template format  
SGI intensity modulation (*.int) ü8 
SGI intensity modulation with alpha (*.inta) ü8

PPM  
Sun™ Raster  
Direct Draw Surface (DDS)  
Targa™  
Alias™ Pix  
SGI clip texture  

 
The format of the file is determined by the file name extension, the magic numbers 
within the file, or the texture attribute file, as described in the following section. 

                                                
8 The SGI format is fully supported by the CDB Specification but a single file extension used, *.rgb.  
Consequently, all image formats (int, inta, rgb, and rgba) are stored in .rgb files regardless of the number of 
channels in the image.

Texture Attribute Files 

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider 
texture attribute (*.attr) files. 

A corresponding attribute file is created for each texture pattern, with the name of 
the attribute file the same as the texture file, followed by the extension “.attr”. These 
attribute files are used by the modeling software, and may not be necessary for the 
application using the database. 

The attribute file contains information specifying how to parse the texture pattern 
file, set the texture hardware and software environment for the texture pattern, or 
position the image in a database. 

The format of the texture attribute file is described in this section.

4 Road Path Files 
CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Road 
Path Files.  

A road path file contains the attributes of a road path node in ASCII format. The name of 
the file is user defined. Each attribute is denoted by a keyword, a literal colon, a space, 
and the value(s). Boolean values are denoted by the string literals “TRUE” and 
“FALSE”. For the “POINT” keyword its values consist of an XYZ coordinate and an 
orientation vector, separated by spaces. The orientation vector is specified as either a 
normal up-vector, or in degrees of heading, pitch, and roll. The “STORE_HPR” 
keyword specifies which method is used. For path nodes that define the road’s centerline 
path, construction information for the correlated road section is also stored with 
additional keywords. Here’s an example:

CDB OpenFlight Readers:  CDB-compliant OpenFlight readers do not consider the Road 
Zone Files.  

Zone files are gridded posts files containing elevation and attribute data for a road. 
The zone data is followed immediately by a series of: 

(Number of data points in x) * (Number of data points in y) elevation data points.  

The elevation data points are followed immediately by a series of: 

(Number of data points in x) * (Number of data points in y) surface types 
corresponding to each of the elevation data points above. 

The elevation data points as well as the surface types begin at the lower-left corner. 
Values are ordered from bottom to top, then in columns from left to right.

A Summary of Changes Version 15.7 
CDB OpenFlight Readers:  This section is not applicable to CDB-compliant OpenFlight 
readers.  The first version of the CDB standard is based on OpenFlight v16.0.   

Overview 

This section describes the changes in the OpenFlight Scene Description between 
versions 15.6 and 15.7. OpenFlight version 15.7 coincides with MultiGen Creator 
versions 2.4 through 2.5.1 and the OpenFlight API versions 2.4 through 2.5.1. The 
changes made for this version are:  

”Continuation Record “ on this page. 
”Header Record” on page 114  
”Mesh Record” on page 115 
”Local Vertex Pool Record” on page 116  
”Mesh Primitive Record” on page 118  
”Multitexture Record” on page 120 
”UV List Record” on page 122 
”Texture Attribute File” on page 123 

Format Changes 

Continuation Record 

All OpenFlight records begin with a 4 byte sequence. The first two bytes identify the 
record (opcode) and the second two bytes specify the length of the record. Given this 
regular record structure, the length of all OpenFlight records is limited to the 
largest value that can be encoded with 2 bytes or 16 bits (65535). In most cases, this 
maximum size is sufficient but there are cases where it is not. For fixed size records, 
this is not a problem. For variable size records, this limitation is being addressed 
with this version.  

A new record, called the continuation record is introduced in this version to 
accommodate variable size records in the OpenFlight Scene Description. The 
continuation record is used to “continue” a record in the OpenFlight Scene 
Description file stream. It would appear in the stream immediately following the 
record that it “continues” (the record that is being continued will be referred to as 
the “original” record). The data contained in the continuation record is defined by 
the original record and is assumed to be directly appended onto the content of the 
original record.

Note: Multiple continuation records may follow a record, in which case all continuation 
records would be appended (in sequence) to the original record.

Varies 4 Length-4 Depends on the original record. The contents 

of this field are to be appended directly to the 
end of the original record contents (before the 
original record contents are parsed) 

Header Record 

New attributes have been appended to the end of the existing header record (see 
“Header Record” on page 19). The following fields were added at the specified offsets 
in the header record.

Mesh Nodes 

A mesh node defines a set of geometric primitives that share attributes and vertices. 
In previous versions of OpenFlight, the fundamental geometric construct was the 
polygon. Each polygon has a unique set of attributes and vertices. Meshes are used 
to represent “sets” of related polygons, each sharing common attributes and 
vertices. Using a mesh, related polygons can be represented in a much more 
compact format. Each mesh will share one set of “polygon” attributes (color, 
material, texture, etc.), a common “vertex pool” and one or more geometric 
primitives that use the shared attributes and vertices. Using a mesh you can 
represent triangle strips, triangle fans, quadrilateral strips and indexed face sets.  

A mesh node is defined by three distinct record types:  

Mesh Record - defines the “polygon” attributes associated to all geometric primitives of 
the mesh.  



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification 
Version 1.0 
Industry Version 3.2 published 19 March 2014 
 

 
347 

© 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

Local Vertex Pool Record - defines the set of vertices that are referenced by the 
geometric primitives of the mesh.  
Mesh Primitive Record - defines a geometric primitive (triangle-strip, triangle-fan, 

quadrilateral-strip or indexed face set) for the mesh.  
A mesh node consists of one mesh record, one local vertex pool record, and one or 
more mesh primitive records. The mesh primitive records are delimited by push 
and pop control records as shown in the following example:  
MESH 
LOCAL VERTEX POOL 
PUSH  MESH 
PRIMITIVE   
MESH PRIMITIVE  
 ...   
MESH PRIMITIVE   
POP   
 

Mesh Record 

The mesh record is the primary record of a mesh node and defines the common 
“face-like” attributes associated to all geometric primitives of the mesh. These 
attributes are identical to those of the face record. See “Face Record” on page 26.

Note: Currently the Local Vertex Pool is used exclusively in the context of mesh nodes, 
but it is designed in a general way so that it may appear in other contexts in future 
versions of the OpenFlight Scene Description.

Mesh Primitive Record 
New record for OpenFlight 15.7  

Data Type Offset Length Description 
Int 0 2 Mesh Primitive Opcode 86 
Unsigned Int 2 2 Length - length of the record 
Int 4 2  Primitive Type - specifies how the vertices 

of the primitive are interpreted 
    1 = Triangle Strip 
    2 = Triangle Fan 
    3 = Quadrilateral Strip 
    4 = Indexed Polygon  
Unsigned Int  6 2  Index Size - specifies the length (in bytes) of 

each of the vertex indices that follow - will 
be either 1, 2, or 4 

Unsigned Int 8  4  Vertex Count - number of vertices in this 
primitive. 

The following field is repeated for each vertex referenced by the mesh primitive. These 
vertices are interpreted according to Primitive Type. In the field below, N ranges from 0 
to Vertex Count - 1. 
Int 12+(N*Index Size) Index 

Size 
IndexN - Index of vertex N of the mesh 
primitive. 

Each mesh primitive is represented using the Mesh Primitive record above.  The 
following descriptions explain how the vertices of each primitive type are interpreted as 
geometry: 

Triangle Strip - This mesh primitive defines a connected group of triangles in the 
context of the enclosing mesh. Each triangle shares the “polygon” attributes defined by 
the enclosing mesh. This primitive contains a sequence of indices that reference vertices 
from the local vertex pool. One triangle is defined for each vertex presented after the first 
two vertices. For odd n, vertices n, n+1, and n+2 define triangle n. For even n, vertices 
n+1, n, and n+2 define triangle n. The first triangle is n=1. The first vertex in the vertex 
pool is n=1. N vertices represent N-2 triangles. 

Triangle Fan - Like the Triangle Strip, this mesh primitive also defines a connected 
group of triangles in the context of the enclosing mesh. Each triangle shares the 
“polygon” attributes defined by the enclosing mesh. This primitive contains a sequence 
of indices that reference vertices from the local vertex pool. One triangle is defined for 
each vertex presented after the first two vertices. Vertices 1, n+1, and n+2 define triangle 
n. The first triangle is n=1. The first vertex in the vertex pool is n=1. N vertices represent 
N-2 triangles. 

Quadrilateral Strip - This mesh primitive defines a connected group of quadrilaterals 
in the context of the enclosing mesh. Each quadrilateral shares the “polygon” attributes 
defined by the enclosing mesh. This primitive contains a sequence of indices that 
reference vertices from the local vertex pool. One quadrilateral is defined for each pair of 
vertices presented after the first pair. Vertices 2n-1, 2n, 2n+2, and 2n+1 define 
quadrilateral n. The first quadrilateral is n=1. The first vertex in the vertex pool is n=1. N 
vertices represent (N/2)-1 quadrilaterals. 
Indexed Polygon -This mesh primitive defines a single polygon in the context of the 

enclosing mesh. This primitive is similar to the other mesh primitives in that it also shares

the polygon attributes of the enclosing mesh. It is different from the other mesh primitive 
types in that while triangle strips/fans and quadrilateral strips describe a set of connected 
triangles/quadrilaterals, the indexed polygon defines a single polygon. This primitive 
contains a sequence of indices that reference vertices from the local vertex pool. One 
polygon is defined by the sequence of vertices in this record. N vertices represent 1 N-
sided closed polygon or 1 (N-1)-sided unclosed polygon. 

Multitexture 

OpenFlight supports 8 textures per polygon or mesh as well as 8 uv's per vertex. 
The current texture information stored on the polygon is referred to as “the base 
texture” or “texture layer 0”. Each additional texture is referred to as “texture layer 
N”. Therefore, to support 8 textures per polygon, a base texture is required as well 
as 7 additional texture layers. The additional texture layers for each polygon, mesh, 
and vertex will be represented in ancillary records at the Face, Mesh, and Vertex 
primary node levels as shown in the following example:  
FACE   
MULTITEXTURE   
PUSH   
VERTEX LIST   
UV LIST   
POP   

The records that are used to represent multitexture in the OpenFlight file are 
described in the following sections. 

Multitexture Record 

The multitexture record is an ancillary record of face and mesh nodes. It specifies 
the texture layer information for the face or mesh.

Multitexture Record 
New record for OpenFlight 15.7  

Data Type  Offset Length Description 
Unsigned Int 0 2 Multitexture Opcode 52 
Unsigned Int 2 2  Length - length of the record 
Int 4 4  Attribute mask - Bit mask indicating what kind of 

multitexture information is present in this record. Bits 
are ordered from left to right as follows: 

   Bit # Description 
   0 Has Layer 1 - if this bit is set, multitexture 

information for texture layer 1 is present. 
   1  Has Layer 2 - if this bit is set, multitexture 

information for texture layer 2 is present. 
   2 Has Layer 3 - if this bit is set, multitexture 

information for texture layer 3 is present. 
   3 Has Layer 4 - if this bit is set, multitexture 

information for texture layer 4 is present.

information for texture layer 7 is present. 
   7-31 Spare 
The following fields are repeated for each multitexture layer that is specified as present by the 
bits set in the Attribute mask field above. This mechanism allows for “sparse” multitexture layer 
information to be present and does not require that the information present be contiguous. 
Unsigned Int Varies 2 textureN - Texture index for texture layer N 
Unsigned Int Varies 2 effectN - Multitexture effect for texture layer N 
    0 = Texture environment 
    1 = Bump map 
    2-100 = Reserved by MultiGen-Paradigm 
    >100 = user (runtime) defined 
Unsigned Int Varies 2 mappingN - Texture mapping index for texture layer N 
Unsigned Int Varies 2 dataN - Texture data for layer N. This is user defined. 

For example, it may be used as a blend percentage or 
color or any other data needed by the runtime to 
describe texture layer N

Indexed String Record 

Switch nodes now allow individual masks to be named. These names are stored in a 
new ancillary record called the Indexed String record. While these new ancillary 
records are currently only applicable to Switch records, they are not limited to 
Switch records and may be useful in future versions of OpenFlight in other contexts.  

The new Indexed String Record is an ancillary record that contains an integer index 
followed by a variable length character string. In this way, arbitrary strings can be 
associated to indices in a general way.  

With respect to Switch mask names, the index specifies the mask number for which 
the string specifies a name. Mask numbers start at 0. Not all masks are required to 
have names.

Local Vertex Pool Record 

The Local Vertex Pool record has been modified to include an alpha color 
component for those vertices in the pool that have color. The alpha color component 
is represented as a 1 byte integer value whose range is 0 (fully transparent) to 255 
(fully opaque). 

The definition of the Attribute mask field has been changed as shown here.  

Note:  The physical layout of this field has not changed, only its definition. The bits for 
which new definitions apply are shown in bold font:

The color field of the vertex pool data (data for each vertex) has been modified to 
include an alpha color component as shown here. The affected field is shown in bold 
font.  

Local Vertex Pool Record changes for OpenFlight15.8 
Color field  

Data Type Offset Description 
Unsigned Int 4 colorN - Color for vertex N - present if Attribute mask 

includes Has Color Index or Has RGBA Color. 
If Has Color Index, lower 3 bytes specify color table 
index, upper 1 byte is Alpha. 
If Has RGBA Color, 4 bytes specify (a, b, g, r) values. 

 

For a complete description of the local vertex pool record, see “Local Vertex Pool 
Record” on page 30. 

Vertex Palette Records 

Vertex Palette Records have been modified to include an alpha color component. 
The alpha color component is represented as a 1 byte integer value whose range is 0 
(fully transparent) to 255 (opaque).  

Prior to OpenFlight version 15.8, vertex colors were represented in vertex palette 
records in one of two ways: Packed Color or Color Index. Depending on the value of 
the Packed color flag, either the Packed color (a, b, g, r) attribute or the Vertex color 
index attribute was valid, but not both. For example, if the Packed color flag was 
TRUE, then the Packed color attribute contained the RGB components of the vertex 
color and the Vertex color index attribute was not specified. Conversely, if the 
Packed color flag was FALSE, then the Vertex color index attribute contained the 
index (in the Color Palette) of the vertex color and the Packed color attribute was 
not specified. Furthermore, the A (alpha) component of the Packed color attribute 
was not valid and was ignored.  

In OpenFlight version 15.8, the A (alpha) component of the Packed color attribute is 
valid and all vertex records include the Packed color (a, b, g, r) attribute, even those 
that also include the Vertex color index attribute. For those vertices that include the 
Vertex color index attribute, the RGB components of the Packed color attribute will 
match those of the color specified by the Vertex color index attribute if it was looked 
up in the color palette. This implies that an application concerned only with the 
RGB components of a vertex color can simply reference the Packed color attribute 
and ignore the Vertex color index attribute in all cases.  

All the updated vertex palette records are shown here. The Packed color is shown in 
bold font to emphasize that it is always specified (for both color index and packed 
color specifications).

Light Points 
The representation of Light Points in OpenFlight version 15.8 is significantly 
different from prior versions. Previously, all light point attributes were described 
completely within the primary record of the light point node.  

In OpenFlight version 15.8, light point attributes have been divided into two 
categories, appearance and behavioral. To accommodate this, two new palettes have 
been created, the Light Point Appearance Palette and the Light Point Animation 
palette. A new Indexed Light Point node record has been added that references 
entries from the Light Point Appearance and Animation palettes. In effect, this 
moves the light point attributes out of the node record itself into entries of the two 
palettes and makes it much easier to share common attributes between multiple 
light points.  

Note that the Light Point Record (Opcode 111) used in previous versions of 
OpenFlight remains valid for applications that require the data in this other format. 
Creator and the OpenFlight API versions 2.6 support both light point formats.  

Following is a description of the new records in OpenFlight version 15.8 used to 
describe Light Point Palettes and Indexed Light Points.  

Light Point Appearance Palette Record 
The light point appearance palette record defines the visual attributes of light 
points.

Indexed Light Point Record 
The indexed light point record is one of the records that can represent a light point 
node. 

The appearance index specifies an entry in the light point appearance palette that 
contains the visual attributes of the light point. 

The animation index specifies an entry in the light point animation palette that 
contains the behavioral attributes of the light point. 

The palette entries referenced by the indexed light point record describe the visual 
state of the light point’s child vertices. Only vertex nodes may be children of light 
point nodes.

dBASE .DBF File Structure 

by Borland Developer Support Staff 
 
 

Technical Information Database 
 

This document has been annotated to reflect the conventions established by the CDB Specification.  
Collectively, these conventions are referred to as dBASE/CDB.  The conventions define how dBASE files are 
interpreted by a CDB-compliant dBASE reader; the stated conventions supersede or replace related aspects 
of this annotated specification.  Unless stated otherwise, CDB-compliant dBASE readers will ignore any data 
that fails to conform to the stated conventions. 

 
 
TI838D.txt   dBASE .DBF File Structure 
Category   :Database Programming 
Platform    :All 
Product    :Delphi  All 
 
Description: 
Sometimes it is necessary to delve into a dBASE table outside the control of the Borland Database Engine (BDE). 
For instance, if the .DBT file (that contains memo data) for a given table is irretrievably lost, the file will not be 
usable because the byte in the file header indicates that there should be a corresponding memo file. This necessitates 
toggling this byte to indicate no such accompanying memo file. Or, you may just want to write your own data access 
routine. 
 
Below are the file structures for dBASE table files. Represented are the file structures as used for various versions of 
dBASE: dBASE III PLUS 1.1, dBASE IV 2.0, dBASE 5.0 for DOS, and dBASE 5.0 for Windows.

====================== 
 
Byte  Contents    Description 
----- --------    -------------------------------------------------------- 
0     1 byte      Valid dBASE III PLUS table file (03h without a memo  
                  (.DBT file; 83h with a memo). 
 
1-3   3 bytes     Date of last update; in YYMMDD format. 
4-7   32-bit      Number of records in the table. 
      number 
8-9   16-bit      Number of bytes in the header. 
      number 
10-11 16-bit      Number of bytes in the record. 
      number 
12-14 3 bytes     Reserved bytes. 
15-27 13 bytes    Reserved for dBASE III PLUS on a LAN. 
28-31 4 bytes     Reserved bytes. 
32-n  32 bytes    Field descriptor array (the structure of this array is 
      each        shown below) 
n+1   1 byte      0Dh stored as the field terminator. 
 
n above is the last byte in the field descriptor array. The size of the 
array depends on the number of fields in the table file. 
 
Table Field Descriptor Bytes 
============================ 
 
Byte  Contents    Description 
----- --------    -------------------------------------------------------- 
0-10  11 bytes    Field name in ASCII (zero-filled). 
11    1 byte      Field type in ASCII (C, D, L, M, or N). 
12-15 4 bytes     Field data address (address is set in memory; not useful 
                  on disk). 
16    1 byte      Field length in binary. 
17    1 byte      Field decimal count in binary. 
18-19 2 bytes     Reserved for dBASE III PLUS on a LAN. 
20    1 byte      Work area ID. 
21-22 2 bytes     Reserved for dBASE III PLUS on a LAN. 
23    1 byte      SET FIELDS flag. 
24-31 1 byte      Reserved bytes. 
 
Table Records 
============= 
 
The records follow the header in the table file. Data records are preceded by one byte, that is, a space (20h) if the 
record is not deleted, an asterisk (2Ah) if the record is deleted. Fields are packed into records without field 
separators or record terminators. The end of the file is mark by a single byte, with the end-of-file marker, an OEM 
code page character value of 26 (1Ah). You can input OEM code page data as indicated below.

Allowable Input for dBASE Data Types 
==================================== 
 
Data Type      Data Input 
-------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
C (Character)  All OEM code page characters. 
D (Date)       Numbers and a character to separate month, day, and year 
               (stored internally as 8 digits in YYYYMMDD format). 
N (Numeric)    - . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
L (Logical)    ? Y y N n T t F f (? when not initialized). 
M (Memo)       All OEM code page characters (stored internally as 10  
               digits representing a .DBT block number). 
 
Binary, Memo, and OLE Fields And .DBT Files 
=========================================== 
 
Memo fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). The size of 
these blocks are internally set to 512 bytes. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBTfile header. 
 
Memo field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the 
field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number. 
 
When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to 
reflect the new location.

Memo Fields And .DBT Files 
=========================================== 
 
Memo fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). SET 
BLOCKSIZE determines the size of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file header. 
 
Each memo field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where 
the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number. 
 
When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to 
reflect the new location.

                  version number; bit 3 indicates presence of a dBASE IV 
                  or dBASE for Windows memo file; bits 4-6 indicate the 
                  presence of a dBASE IV SQL table; bit 7 indicates the 
                  presence of any .DBT memo file (either a dBASE III PLUS 
                  type or a dBASE IV or dBASE for Windows memo file). 
1-3   3 bytes     Date of last update; in YYMMDD format.

Table Records 
============= 
 
The records follow the header in the table file. Data records are preceded by one byte, that is, a space (20h) if the 
record is not deleted, an asterisk (2Ah) if the record is deleted. Fields are packed into records without field 
separators or record terminators. The end of the file is marked by a single byte, with the end-of-file marker, an OEM 
code page character value of 26 (1Ah). You can input OEM code page data as indicated below. 
 
Allowable Input for dBASE Data Types 
==================================== 
 
Data Type      Data Input 
-------------- ----------------------------------------------------------- 
C (Character)  All OEM code page characters. 
D (Date)       Numbers and a character to separate month, day, and year 
               (stored internally as 8 digits in YYYYMMDD format). 
F (Floating    - . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
  point binary 
  numeric) 
N (Numeric)    - . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
L (Logical)    ? Y y N n T t F f (? when not initialized). 
M (Memo)       All OEM code page characters (stored internally as 10 
               digits representing a .DBT block number). 
 
Memo Fields And .DBT Files 
=========================================== 
 
Memo fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, and so on). SET 
BLOCKSIZE determines the size of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file header. 
 
Each memo field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where 
the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (20h) rather than a number. 
 
When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to 
reflect the new location. 
 
Unlike dBASE III PLUS, if you delete text in a memo field, dBASE 5.0 for DOS may reuse the space from the 
deleted text when you input new text. dBASE III PLUS always appends new text to the end of the .DBT file. In 
dBASE III PLUS, the .DBT file size grows whenever new text is added, even if other text in the file is deleted.

Appendix F 

F. CDB Model Components 
Model components represent concrete parts found on 3D models whether the model is used as a 
moving model or a cultural feature.  This appendix constitutes a data dictionary of names that 
can be used for zone names, as defined in chapter 6.  Note that names are independent from 
simulation models and client devices since they represent real and tangible objects or 
components found on 3D models.  The XML file containing the CDB Model Components is part 
of the CDB Specification Distribution Package and can be found in the following file: 

 

\CDB\Metadata\Model_Components.xml 

 

Note: As of CDB Specification 3.2, the list of CDB model components is no longer presented 
here to avoid the risk of miscorrelation between the appendix and the metadata.  The list is now 
exclusively found in the Metadata folder.

Appendix G 

G. Gamma Tutorial 

G.1 Introduction9 
There is nominally no gamma correction done to the stored samples of CDB imagery files.  As a 
result, a gamma of 1/2.2 should be applied to imagery data when viewing it through a (sRGB-
calibrated) monitor with gamma of 2.2.  The CDB specification recommends the sRGB IEC 
61966-2 standard when performing the calibration of displays (at DBGF or a simulator).  The 
sRGB standard provides the necessary guidelines for the handling of gamma, and of color (in a 
device-independent fashion) under specified viewing conditions. 

 

It would be convenient for graphics programmers if all of the components of an imaging system 
were linear.  The voltage coming from an electronic camera would be directly proportional to the 
intensity (power) of light in the scene; the light emitted by a CRT would be directly proportional 
to its input voltage, and so on.  However, real-world devices do not behave in this way. 

 

Real imaging systems will have several components, and more than one of these can be 
nonlinear.  If all of the components have transfer characteristics that are power functions, then 
the transfer function of the entire system is also a power function.  The exponent (gamma) of the 
whole system's transfer function is just the product of all of the individual exponents (gammas) 
of the separate stages in the system.  Also, stages that are linear pose no problem, since a power 
function with an exponent of 1.0 is really a linear function.  So a linear transfer function is just a 
special case of a power function, with a gamma of 1.0.  Thus, as long as our imaging system 
contains only stages with linear and power-law transfer functions, we can meaningfully talk 
about the gamma of the entire system.  This is indeed the case with most real imaging systems. 

 

If the overall gamma of an imaging system is 1.0, its output is linearly proportional to its input.  
This means that the ratio between the intensities of any two areas in the reproduced image will 
be the same as it was in the original scene.  It might seem that this should always be the goal of 
an imaging system: to accurately reproduce the tones of the original scene.  Alas, that is not the 
case. 

  

When the reproduced image is to be viewed in “bright surround” conditions, where other white 
objects nearby in the room have about the same brightness as white in the image, then an overall 
gamma of 1.0 does indeed give real-looking reproduction of a natural scene.  Photographic prints

viewed under room light and computer displays in bright room light are typical “bright surround” 
viewing conditions. 

 

However, sometimes images are intended to be viewed in “dark surround” conditions, where the 
room is substantially black except for the image.  This is typical of the way movies and slides 
(transparencies) are viewed by projection.  Under these circumstances, an accurate reproduction 
of the original scene results in an image that human viewers judge as “flat” and lacking in 
contrast.  It turns out that the projected image needs to have a gamma of about 1.5 relative to the 
original scene for viewers to judge it “natural”.  Thus, slide film is designed to have a gamma of 
about 1.5, not 1.0.  

There is also an intermediate condition called “dim surround”, where the rest of the room is still 
visible to the viewer, but is noticeably darker than the reproduced image itself.  This is typical of 
television viewing, at least in the evening, as well as subdued-light computer work areas.  In dim 
surround conditions, the reproduced image needs to have a gamma of about 1.25 relative to the 
original scene in order to look natural. 

 

The requirement for boosted contrast (gamma) in dark surround conditions is due to the way the 
human visual system works, and applies equally well to computer monitors.  Thus, a modeler 
trying to achieve the maximum realism for the images it displays really needs to know what the 
room lighting conditions are, and adjust the gamma of the displayed image accordingly. 

 

If asking the user about room lighting conditions is inappropriate or too difficult, it is reasonable 
to assume that the overall gamma (viewing_gamma as defined below) is somewhere between 1.0 
and 1.25.  That's all that most systems that implement gamma correction do. 

 

According to PNG (Portable Network Graphics) Specification Version 1.0, W3C 
Recommendation 01-October-1996 Appendix, Gamma Tutorial,  

(http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-GammaAppendix ): 

 

“All display systems, almost all photographic film, and many electronic cameras have nonlinear 
signal-to-light-intensity or intensity-to-signal characteristics.  Fortunately, all of these nonlinear 
devices have a transfer function that is approximated fairly well by a single type of mathematical 
function: a power function.  This power function has the general equation

output = input ^ gamma 

 

where ^ denotes exponentiation, and “gamma” (often printed using the Greek letter gamma, thus 
the name) is simply the exponent of the power function. 

 

By convention, “input” and “output” are both scaled to the range [0..1], with 0 representing black 
and 1 representing maximum white.  Normalized in this way, the power function is completely 
described by a single number, the exponent “gamma”. 

 

So, given a particular device, we can measure its output as a function of its input, fit a power 
function to this measured transfer function, extract the exponent, and call it gamma10.  We often 
say “this device has a gamma of 2.5” as a shorthand for “this device has a power-law response 
with an exponent of 2.5”.  We can also talk about the gamma of a mathematical transform, or of 
a lookup table in a frame buffer, so long as the input and output of the thing are related by the 
power-law expression above. 

 

Real imaging systems will have several components, and more than one of these can be 
nonlinear.  If all of the components have transfer characteristics that are power functions, then 
the transfer function of the entire system is also a power function.  The exponent (gamma) of the 
whole system's transfer function is just the product of all of the individual exponents (gammas) 
of the separate stages in the system. 

 

Also, stages that are linear pose no problem, since a power function with an exponent of 1.0 is 
really a linear function.  So a linear transfer function is just a special case of a power function, 
with a gamma of 1.0. 

 

                                                
10  Gamma refers to the measured transfer function that represents the non-linear response of the device.  CRT 

devices have traditionally dominated the computer graphics/television industry and have an exponential 
response; as a result, the “gamma” of a device is often represented as a single value representing the “best-fit” 
exponent of power-law response of the device.  A more accurate and general approach to gamma involves a 
look-up table which captures the (arbitrary) response of the device.

Thus, as long as our imaging system contains only stages with linear and power-law transfer 
functions, we can meaningfully talk about the gamma of the entire system.  This is indeed the 
case with most real imaging systems.”11 

 

In an ideal world, sample values would be stored in floating point, there would be lots of 
precision, and it wouldn't really matter much.  But in reality, we're always trying to store images 
in as few bits as we can. 

 

If we decide to use samples that are linearly proportional to intensity, and do the gamma 
correction in the frame buffer LUT, it turns out that we need to use at least 12-16 bits for each of 
red, green, and blue to have enough precision in intensity.  With any less than that, we will 
sometimes see “contour bands” or “Mach bands” in the darker areas of the image, where two 
adjacent sample values are still far enough apart in intensity for the difference to be visible. 

 

However, through an interesting coincidence, the human eye's subjective perception of 
brightness is related to the physical stimulation of light intensity in a manner that is very much 
like the power function used for gamma correction.  If we apply gamma correction to measured 
(or calculated) light intensity before quantizing to an integer for storage in a frame buffer, we can 
get away with using many fewer bits to store the image.  In fact, 8 bits per color is almost always 
sufficient to avoid contouring artifacts.  This is because, since gamma correction is so closely 
related to human perception, we are assigning our 256 available sample codes to intensity values 
in a manner that approximates how visible those intensity changes are to the eye.  Compared to a 
linear-sample image, we allocate fewer sample values to brighter parts of the tonal range and 
more sample values to the darker portions of the tonal range. 

 

Thus, for the same apparent image quality, images using gamma-encoded sample values need 
only about two-thirds as many bits of storage as images using linear samples. 

 

If we consider a pipeline that involves capturing (or calculating) an image, storing it in an image 
file, reading the file, and displaying the image on some sort of display screen, there are at least 5

places in the pipeline that could have nonlinear transfer functions.  Let's give each a specific 
name for their characteristic gamma12: 

 

(1) Camera_gamma ( cγ ): The characteristic of the image sensor. 
 

(2) Encoding_gamma ( eγ ): The gamma of any transformation performed by the 
software writing the image file. 

 

(3) Decoding_gamma ( dγ ): The gamma of any transformation performed by any 
software reading the image file. 

 

(4) LUT_gamma ( lutγ ): The gamma of the frame buffer LUT, if present. 
 

(5) CRT_gamma ( crtγ ): The gamma of the device, i.e. the nonlinear signal-
to-light-intensity or intensity-to-signal charac-
teristics.  For CRT-based devices, this is generally 
2.5. 

 

In addition, let's add a few other names: 

 

(1) File_gamma ( fγ ): The gamma of the image in the file, relative to the 
original scene, i.e.  ecf γγγ =  

 

(2) DS_gamma ( DSγ ): The gamma of the “display system” downstream of 
the frame buffer.  In this context, the term display 
system encompasses everything after the frame 
buffer, that  is CRTlutDS γγγ =

(3) Viewing_gamma ( vγ ): The overall gamma that we want to obtain to 
produce pleasing images generally 1.0 to 1.25. 

 

When the file_gamma is not 1.0, we know that some form of gamma correction has been done 
on the sample values in the file, and we call them “gamma corrected” samples.  However, since 
there can be so many different values of gamma in the image display chain, and some of them 
are not known at the time the image is written, the samples are not really being “corrected” for a 
specific display condition.  We are really using a power function in the process of encoding an 
intensity range into a small integer field, and so it is more correct to say “gamma encoded” 
samples instead of “gamma corrected” samples.  The CDB specification does not rely on such 
gamma encoding in order to achieve smaller integer number representations.  Instead, the CDB 
specification relies on standard compression algorithms to achieve an efficient representation of 
color imagery.13 

 

When displaying an image file on the simulator, the image-decoding software is responsible for 
making the overall gamma of the system equal to the desired viewing_gamma, by selecting the 
decoding_gamma appropriately.  If the viewing condition is different from the specification, then 
the decoding process must compensate.  This can be done by modifying the gamma values in 
equation G-1 below by the appropriate factor.  If one does modify the gamma values in equation 
G-1 below, extreme care must be taken to avoid quantization errors when working with 24 bit 
images.  The display_gamma should be measured (and known) for the display rendering the 
image (either at the DB generation workstation or the simulator).  The correct viewing_gamma 
depends on lighting conditions, and that will generally have to come from the user.  In dimly lit 
office environments, the generally preferred value for viewing gamma is in the vicinity of 
1.12514.  In many digital video systems, camera_gamma is about 0.5.  CRT_gamma is typically 
2.2, while encoding_gamma, decoding_gamma, and LUT_gamma are all 1.0.  As a result, 
viewing_gamma ends up being about 1.125.  Coincidently, this happens to be the optimal 
viewing gamma for an ambient luminance level of 64 lux or 5 ft-lbt. 

 

 vDSdc γγγγ =  (eq. G-1) 

                                                
13  The JPEG-2000 standard is based on the sRGB default color space per the IEC 61966-2-1 Standard which 

calls for a gamma 2.2 under the specified viewing conditions 

14  Historically, viewing gammas of 1.5 have been used for viewing projected slides in a dark room and 
viewing gammas of 1.25 have been used for viewing monitors in a very dim room. This very dim room value of 
1.25 has been used extensively in television systems and assumes a ambient luminance level of approximately 15 
lux (or 1.4 ft-lb). The current proposal assumes an encoding ambient luminance level of 64 lux (or 5. ft-lb) which 
is more representative of a dim room in viewing computer generated imagery or a FAA level-D approved flight 
simulator visual system. Such a system assumes a viewing gamma of 1.125 and is thus consistent with the ITU-R 
BT.709 standard.

In a complex system such as a flight simulator, the system architect must be 
aware of the gamma at every stage of the system, starting from the source of the 
imagery (e.g. camera or satellite) right through to the simulator’s display device.  
His objective is to ensure that product of all gammas match the viewing gamma of 
the simulator.  

 

Given the above assumptions, and our objective of ensuring that the product of all gammas in the 
viewing chain equals the viewing gamma, the modeler will end up (subjectively) adjusting 
images to an equivalent file gamma of 1.25.   

 

The bottom portion of the illustration show the path taken by the CDB imagery as it is ingested 
first by the real-time publisher, then by the IG, the IG color look-up tables and finally through to 
the visual display system.  In this example, we will assume the following: 

1. The imagery file in the CDB is unmodified (i.e. those produced by the Adobe 
Photoshop at the DBGF).  Note that as a result of viewing gamma of 

25.1=vγ , the file gamma ended up at 25.1=fγ  at the DBGF.  As a result, 
the CDB also has a file gamma of 25.1=fγ  

2. The IG performs all of its internal operations in a linear color space (i.e. the 
IG_gamma is 00.1=IGγ ) 

3. The simulator visual system produces an average scene brightness of 
approximately 6 ft-lamberts: under these viewing conditions, the viewing 
gamma is 125.1=vγ . 

4. The measured gamma of the visual display system is 025.2=crtγ  
5. The content of the IG’s color look-up tables is adjusted to compensate for the 

gamma of the visual display system, i.e. it is loaded with 025.2
1=lutγ  

 

Given the above assumptions, and our objective of ensuring that the product of all gammas in the 
chain equals the viewing gamma of 1.125, the required visual run-time publisher gamma must 
account for the difference in viewing gamma at the DBGF and at the simulator.  As a result, the 
publisher gamma must be (1.125/1.25).

G.2 Harmonization of Gamma at DBGF with Gamma of Simulator Visual System 
Both the modelers and the visual system architects should be keenly aware of the handling of 
gamma at the Database Generation Facility and at the simulator.  Figure G-1: Typical Handling 
of Gamma at DBGF and Simulator, illustrates the typical handling of gamma in both of these 
cases.  

 

The top portion of the illustration shows the path taken by source data as a modeler is viewing it 
at this workstation via the application software.  In this example, we will assume the following: 

1. The DBGF imagery application is Adobe Photoshop.  The default color space 
profile used by Adobe Photoshop (i.e. the *.icm file) is the sRGB Color Space 
Profile which is defined by the sRGB standard to be a gamma of 2.2, therefore 
the Photoshop uses a 2.2/1=lutγ  

2. The DBGF workstation is running Windows (therefore the O/S does not 
gammatize the imagery before sending it to the display, 25.1=dγ ) 

3. The measure gamma of the DBGF workstation monitor is 2.2=CRTγ  
4. The DBGF workstation is located in a dimly lit room, so the viewing gamma 

is in effect 25.1=vγ

Figure G-1: Typical Handling of Gamma at DBGF and Simulator 
 

G.3 Handling of Color 
The default CDB specification color space follows the same convention as the Windows sRGB 
Color Space Profile.  sRGB is the default color space in Windows, based on the IEC 61966-2-1 
Standard.  A sRGB compliant device does not have to provide a profile or other support for color 
management to work well. 

 

Nonetheless, whether calibrated or not to the IEC Standard, all variants of RGB are typically 
close enough that undemanding viewers can get by with simply displaying the data without color 
correction.  By storing calibrated RGB, the CDB standard retains compatibility with existing 
database tools and software programs that expect RGB data, yet provides enough information for 
conversion to XYZ in applications that need precise colors.  Thus, the CDB specification gets the 
best of both worlds. 

Full compliance to the CDB specification requires adherence to the color space described in this 
section; however, in virtually all cases, direct use of un-calibrated RGB is sufficient.  The 
builders of Synthetic Environment Databases and the users of Visual Systems should be aware of

these color space conventions; significant deviation from the underlying IEC assumptions may 
yield significant color differences. 

 

The CDB specification encoded RGB color tri-stimulus values assume the following: 

 

(1) Display luminance level:  80 cd/m2 
 

(2) Display white point x = 0.3127, y = 0.3291 (D65)

Recommendation 01-October-1996 Appendix, Color Tutorial, 

(http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-GammaAppendix): 

 

“The color of an object depends not only on the precise spectrum of light emitted or reflected 
from it, but also on the observer, their species, what else they can see at the same time, even 
what they have recently looked at.  Furthermore, two very different spectra can produce exactly 
the same color sensation.  Color is not an objective property of real-world objects; it is a 
subjective, biological sensation.  However, by making some simplifying assumptions (such as: 
we are talking about human vision) it is possible to produce a mathematical model of color and 
thereby obtain good color accuracy.

G.3.1 Device-dependent Color 
Display the same RGB data on three different monitors, side by side, and you will get a 
noticeably different color balance on each display.  This is because each monitor emits a slightly 
different shade and intensity of red, green, and blue light.  RGB is an example of a device-
dependent color model; the color you get depends on the device.  This also means that a 
particular color represented as say RGB 87, 146, 116 on one monitor might have to be specified 
as RGB 98, 123, 104 on another to produce the same color. 

G.3.2 Device-independent color 
A full physical description of a color would require specifying the exact spectral power 
distribution of the light source.  Fortunately, the human eye and brain are not so sensitive as to 
require exact reproduction of a spectrum.  Mathematical, device-independent color models exist 
that describe fairly well how a particular color will be seen by humans.  The most important 
device-independent color model, to which all others can be related, was developed by the 
International Commission on Illumination in 1931 (CIE-1931, in French) and is called “CIE 
XYZ” or simply “XYZ”. 

 

In XYZ, X is the sum of a weighted power distribution over the whole visible spectrum.  So are 
Y and Z, each with different weights.  Thus any arbitrary spectral power distribution is 
condensed down to just three floating-point numbers.  The weights were derived from color 
matching experiments done on human subjects in the 1920s.  CIE XYZ has been an International 
Standard since 1931, and it has a number of useful properties: 

 

(1) Two colors with the same XYZ values will look the same to humans 
 

(2) Two colors with different XYZ values will not look the same 
 

(3) The Y value represents all the brightness information (luminance) 
 

(4) The XYZ color of any object can be objectively measured 
 

Color models based on XYZ have been used for many years by people who need accurate 
control of color i.e., lighting engineers for film and TV, paint and dyestuffs manufacturers, and 
so on.  They are thus proven in industrial use.  Accurate, device-independent color started to 
spread from high-end, specialized areas into the mainstream during the late 1980s and early 
1990s, and CDB takes notice of that trend.

G.4 Calibrated, Device-Dependent Color 
Traditionally, image file formats have used uncalibrated, device-dependent color.  If the precise 
details of the original display device are known, it becomes possible to convert the device-
dependent colors of a particular image to device-independent ones.  Making simplifying 
assumptions, such as working with CRTs (which are much easier than printers), all we need to 
know are the XYZ values of each primary color and the CRT exponent. 

 

So why does not the CDB specification store images in XYZ instead of RGB?  Well, two 
reasons.  First, storing images in XYZ would require more bits of precision, which would make 
the files bigger.  Second, all programs would have to convert the image data before viewing it.  
But more importantly, whether calibrated or not, all variants of RGB are close enough that 
undemanding viewers can get by with simply displaying the data without color correction.  By 
storing calibrated RGB, the CDB specification retains compatibility with existing database tools 
and software programs that expect RGB data, yet provides enough information for conversion to 
XYZ in applications that need precise colors.  Thus, we get the best of both worlds. 

G.5 What are chromaticity and luminance? 
Chromaticity is an objective measurement of the color of an object, leaving aside the brightness 
information.  Chromaticity uses two parameters x and y, which are readily calculated from XYZ: 

 

x = X / (X + Y + Z) 

y = Y / (X + Y + Z) 
(eq. G-3) 

 

XYZ colors having the same chromaticity values will appear to have the same hue but can vary 
in absolute brightness.  Notice that x,y are dimensionless ratios, so they have the same values no 
matter what units we've used for X,Y,Z. 

 

The Y value of an XYZ color is directly proportional to its absolute brightness and is called the 
luminance of the color.  We can describe a color either by XYZ coordinates or by chromaticity 
x,y plus luminance Y.  The XYZ form has the advantage that it is linearly related to RGB 
intensities. 

G.6 How are computer monitor colors described? 
The “white point” of a display device is the chromaticity x,y of the monitor's nominal white, that 
is, the color produced when R = G = B = maximum.

It's customary to specify CRT monitor colors by giving the chromaticities of the individual 
phosphors R, G, and B, plus the white point.  The white point allows one to infer the relative 
brightness of the three phosphors, which isn't determined by their chromaticities alone. 

 

NOTE: The absolute brightness of the monitor is not specified.  For computer 
graphics work, we generally don't care very much about absolute 
brightness levels.  Instead of dealing with absolute XYZ values (in which 
X,Y,Z are expressed in physical units of radiated power, such as candelas 
per square meter), it is convenient to work in “relative XYZ” units, where 
the monitor's nominal white is taken to have a luminance (Y) of 1.0.  
Given this assumption, it's simple to compute XYZ coordinates for the 
monitor's white, red, green, and blue from their chromaticity values. 

G.7 How do I convert from source_RGB to XYZ 
Make a few simplifying assumptions first, like the monitor really is jet black with no input and 
the guns don't interfere with one another.  Then, given that you know the  

 

CIE XYZ values for each of red, green, and blue for a particular monitor, you put them into a 
matrix M:

M  (eq. G-4) 

 

RGB intensity samples normalized to the range zero to one can be converted to XYZ by matrix 
multiplication. 

 

NOTE: If you the RGB samples are gamma-encoded, the gamma encoding must 
be un-done.

Where M-1=  The inverse of the matrix M used to go from XYZ-1931 color 
space to the CDB specification RGB color space. 

 

In the RGB encoding process, negative sRGB tri-stimulus values, and sRGB tri-stimulus values 
greater than 1,00 are not retained.  When encoding software cannot support this extended range, 
the luminance dynamic range and color gamut of RGB is limited to the tri-stimulus values 
between 0,0 and 1,0 by simple clipping. 

 

According to PNG (Portable Network Graphics) Specification Version 1.0, W3C 
Recommendation 01-October-1996 Appendix, Color Tutorial, 

(http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-GammaAppendix): 

 

“The gamut of a device is the subset of visible colors that the device can display.  
(Note that this has nothing to do with gamma.)  The gamut of an RGB device can 
be visualized as a polyhedron in XYZ space; the vertices correspond to the 
device's black, blue, red, green, magenta, cyan, yellow, and white. 

 

Different devices have different gamut (e.g. database generation workstation, 
simulator display systems).  In other words one device may be able to display 
certain colors (usually highly saturated ones) that another device cannot.  The 
gamut of a particular RGB device can be determined from its R, G, and B 
chromaticities and white point.

Converting image data from one device to another generally results in gamut 
mismatches colors that cannot be represented exactly on the destination device.  
The process of making the colors fit, which can range from a simple clip to 
elaborate nonlinear scaling transformations, is termed gamut mapping.  The aim is 
to produce a reasonable visual representation of the original image.

Appendix J 

J. XML Schema Definitions 
The CDB specification makes an extensive use of XML to describe several parts of the 
specification.  XML is used to describe CDB metadata, to store global datasets, to add attributes 
to OpenFlight models, to describe base and composite materials, etc. 

 

This appendix lists all the schemas used by the Specification.  A schema is required to formally 
define the format of an XML file and to validate its content. 

 

Note: As of version 3.2 of the Specification, XML schemas are no longer provided in 
text form in appendix J.  Instead, the actual XSD files are delivered with the CDB 
Specification Distribution Package. 

 

The following XML Schemas can be found in the \CDB\Metadata\Schema subdirectory of the 
CDB Specification Distribution Package: 

1. Base_Material_Table.xsd 
2. Composite_Material_Table.xsd 
3. Configuration.xsd 
4. Defaults.xsd 
5. Feature_Data_Dictionary.xsd 
6. Lights.xsd 
7. Lights_Tuning.xsd 
8. Model_Components.xsd 
9. Model_Metadata.xsd 
10. OpenFlight_Model_Extensions.xsd 
11. Vector_Attributes.xsd 
12. Version.xsd 

 

J.1 The CDB Namespace 
The CDB Specification makes use of several XML namespaces to isolate the definitions of its 
schemas.  The name of these namespaces is built around a base URL whose name is 
“http://www.CDB-Spec.org/”15. 

J.2 Schema Conventions 
The target namespace of all CDB schemas follow this pattern: 

                                                
15 As of December 2013, this URL does not correspond to an active Web site.  An XML namespace does not need to 
be the address of a Web site, although it is practical to do so because it ensures its uniqueness.

Where the Name is identical to the filename portion of the file containing the schema and 
Version is the version number of the schema.

found in Version.xsd (item 12 in the list above):

Appendix K 

K. CDB Coordinate Systems 

K.1 Spatial Reference Frames (SRF) and Coordinate Systems 
The handling of spatial data requires a good deal of rigor to accurately describe the position of 
points in space.  Furthermore, it requires the ability to define directions and distances.  
Generally, this is accomplished through the use of coordinate systems. 

It is often convenient to represent position in several different spatial reference frames.  Each 
spatial reference frame provides a particular way of defining positions within its domain.  This 
level of abstraction also permits spatial reference frames to be decomposed into a series of, or 
even a hierarchy of reference, each relative to another reference frames.  This mechanism 
permits objects to be independently defined (positioned, oriented, and scaled) with respect to a 
local spatial reference frame and then be later incorporated into other reference frames.  The 
reference frames can be abstract mathematical constructs or they can be bound to real world 
objects (e.g., a flap located defined in a flap reference frame which in turn is bound to an aircraft 
wing reference frame). 

The CDB specification defines the conceptual model and the methodologies that allow the 
description, and transformation or conversion, of geometric properties within a set of spatial 
reference frames supported by the Specification.  The CDB Spatial Reference Model (SRM) 
supports an unambiguous specification of the positions, directions, and distances associated with 
spatial information.  It also defines algorithms for precise transformation of positions, directions 
and distances among different spatial reference frames. 

K.2 CDB Approach 
One of the primary objectives of the CDB specification is to provide the means to represent the 
entire earth.  Secondly, it must handle spatial data with a good deal of rigor to accurately 
describe the position of points in space, and must do so at the level of fidelity commensurate 
with the precision that is now possible in modern simulators. 

The size, content, fidelity and precision of synthetic environments now warrant a different 
approach, an approach that entirely avoids the “problem with projections” and other 
approximations used in the past.  To this end, the CDB specification mandates the use of 
geographic coordinates to represent the shape of terrain surfaces and the position of all cultural 
features.  Since no projections are involved, full geometric coherence is assured without 
compromise and all four key spatial properties can be achieved simultaneously: 

 

(1) Preservation of distance 
(2) Preservation of direction 
(3) Preservation of area 
(4) Preservation of shape

K.3 CDB SRF Specifications, and Algorithmic Development 
The CDB specification is based on a surface geodetic coordinate system, i.e., points on the earth 
surface are specified in geographic lat/long/elevation coordinates. 

The CDB embeds modeled point features (e.g., the representation of 3-D objects, moving and/or 
static) within a General Cartesian Coordinate System.  Its use is generally constrained to objects 
that are small in comparison to the earth.  As shown below, a modeled point feature can be 
referenced anywhere on the earth by providing the model’s orientation (the AO1 attribute 
specified in Chapter 5) and the model’s origin using a set of geographic lat/long/elevation 
coordinates.  Note that the model’s z-axis implicitly points upward with respect to the earth 
surface. 

 
Figure K-1: Cartesian Model positioned to WGS-84 Coordinates 

 

The earth shape is described by the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid.  The Specification also defines 
three related set of Spatial Frames (and associated coordinate systems) for use in conjunction 
with the surface geodetic coordinate system; they are: 

 

(1) Earth-centered Cartesian (Geocentric) 
(2) Generic Cartesian 
(3) Local Vertical (LVCS)

K.3.1 Geographical Coordinate System (Geodetic) 
The geographical coordinate system (also called the geodetic coordinate system), where the 
coordinates are longitude, latitude and altitude above mean sea level, is the most commonly used 
coordinate system today.  Geographical latitude  and longitude  are the angles of the normal 
on the reference ellipsoid along the point to the equator and zero meridian.  The angles are 
normally given as degrees, minutes and seconds.  Altitude above mean sea level is the distance 
above and normal to the geoid in meters.  The WGS 84 ellipsoid represents the actual geoid 
within an accuracy of 100 meters.  The prime meridian and the equator are the reference planes 
used to define latitude and longitude. 

In other terms, the geographic latitude – there are many other defined latitudes – of a point is the 
angle between the equatorial plane and a line normal to the reference ellipsoid’s surface.  The 
geographic longitude of a point is the angle between a reference plane, Greenwich, and a plane 
passing through the point, both planes being perpendicular to the equatorial plane.  The 
geographic height at a point is the distance from the reference ellipsoid to the point in a direction 
normal to the reference ellipsoid.

Field Specification 

Notes 

(1) The CS surface is the oblate ellipsoid (or sphere) 
surface excluding the pole points. 

(2) The geodetic 3D CS induces this CS on the 3rd 
coordinate surface at any point for which h = 0. 

(3) If a = b, the geodetic latitude   coincides with the 
spherical latitude . 

(4) For WGS-84 a= 6,378,137 m and b = 6,356,752 m.  
The inverse flattening ratio f-1 is 298.257223563. 

K.3.2 Earth-Centered SRF (aka Rectangular Geocentric SRF) 
The earth-centered spatial reference frame defines a three-dimensional Euclidian space with 
respect to the geometric center of the reference ellipsoid, the center of the earth.  The reference 
datum of the Earth-centered SRF is based on the WGS-84 ellipsoid reference model.  In this 
SRF, the z-axis is pointing at the North Pole, the x-axis is pointing at the intersection of the 
equator and the Greenwich meridian, the prime meridian, and the y-axis is pointing at the 
intersection of the equator and 90o east longitude.  The associated coordinate system is called the 
World Coordinate System (WCS); its units are meters.  The WCS is used to specify the 3D 
position of objects with respect to the earth-centered SRF.  This coordinate system is used as an 
intermediate system to convert geodetic coordinates to LVCS and vice versa. 

K.3.3 General Cartesian SRF 
The Cartesian spatial reference frame defines a three-dimensional Euclidian space with respect to 
an arbitrary origin.  The reference datum specifying the origin and the orientation of the SRF is 
arbitrary, i.e. the reference datum can be specified within a geocentric SRF, a LVCS SRF or any 
other SRF.  The SRF is right-handed and orthonormal.  In this SRF system, the z-axis is pointing 
up and both the x-axis and y-axis lie in the horizontal plane.  The associated coordinate system is 
called the General Cartesian Coordinate System; coordinates are specified in meters.  This 
coordinate system is used for the representation of 3-D objects, moving and/or static.  Its use is 
generally constrained to objects that are small in comparison to the earth16. 

K.3.4 Local Vertical SRF 
The Local Vertical SRF (LVCS) spatial reference frame defines a three-dimensional Euclidian 
space.  It is a SRF similar to the Geocentric SRF except that the origin of the SRF is translated 
and rotated to a point on the surface of the WGS-84 ellipsoid.  At that point, the x-y plane is 
tangent to the surface of the earth and the z-axis is normal to the ellipsoid.  The associated 
coordinate system is called the local vertical coordinate system; the coordinates are specified in 
meters.  In this coordinate system, the z-axis is pointing up, the y-axis is pointing north and the

x-axis is pointing east.  Its use is generally constrained to a surface that is small in comparison to 
the earth17. 

K.4 Geodetic to Geocentric Transformation 
Information providers and information consumers must transform geodetic information to 
geocentric information according to the following: 

 

(1) If < , , h> represents the geodetic coordinates to be transformed, where  is 
the latitude,  is the longitude, and h is the WGS84 height above mean-sea-
level; and 

 

(2) If <x, y, z> represents the geocentric coordinates; then using the WGS84 
ellipsoid equatorial radius, a, of 6,378,137.0m and the WGS84 ellipsoid polar 
radius, b, of 6,356,752.314245m, the flattening f, the eccentricity e and the 
radius of curvature as a function of latitude N( ) are given by equation eq. A-
1: 

 

( ) abaf −=  

22 2 ffe −=  

( ) ϕϕ 22 sin1 eaN −=  

(eq. A-1) 

 

 

From these equations, we define the transformation of each geodetic coordinate as: 

 

( )( ) λϕϕ coscoshNx +=  

( )( ) λϕϕ sincoshNy +=  

( )( ) ϕϕ sin)1( 2 heNz +−=  

(eq. A-2) 

 

                                                
17 To ensure that the object preserves its shape, size, orientation, and direction

K.5 Geocentric to Geodetic Transformation 
Geocentric coordinates cannot be transformed to the geodetic coordinate system directly.  
Instead, a successive approximation approach is used to compute the new coordinates.  The 
following describes the algorithm to convert geocentric coordinates <x, y, z> to geodetic 
coordinates < , , h>, where  is the latitude,  is the longitude, and h is the WGS84 height 
above mean-sea-level.  First, using the WGS84 ellipsoid equatorial radius, a = 6,378,137.0 m 
and the WGS84 ellipsoid polar radius, b = 6,356,752.314245 m, the flattening f and the 
eccentricity e of the ellipsoid are given by equation A-3: 

 

( ) abaf −=  

22 2 ffe −=  
(eq. A-3) 

 

We first compute the longitude  with equation A-4:

Then, we iteratively compute the radius of curvature as a function of latitude N( ) and, as a 
result we iteratively converge to a new, more accurate latitude ’ with equation A-6: 

 

( ) ϕϕ 22 sin1 eaN −=  (eq. A-6)

K.6 Geodetic to LVCS Coordinate Transformation 
The transformation of a geodetic coordinate into an LVCS coordinate is decomposed into two 
parts: 

 

(1) Apply a coordinate transformation to each coordinate of an object from the 
geodetic coordinate system to the rectangular geocentric coordinate system. 

 

(2) Then apply a second transformation to go from the geocentric coordinate 
system to LVCS. 

 

The first transformation, from geodetic to rectangular geocentric is described in section K.4.  The 
transformation is applied to the origin of the object.  The result of this transformation is the 
origin x0 of the object in the geocentric coordinate system.  Then for each coordinate x of the 
object, we apply the geodetic to geocentric transformation to coordinate x and we then compute 
the translation vector t between x and x0 in the geocentric coordinate system with equation A-8 

 

0xxt −=  (eq. A-8) 

  

 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification

© 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

The second transformation, from geocentric to LVCS is presented here as an algorithm to 
transform all coordinates of an object from the geodetic coordinate system to LVCS.  The 
transformation from geodetic to LVCS first requires the assembly of a 3x3 rotation matrix M 
with equation A-9:

ϕ λ ϕ λ ϕ

−⎡ ⎤
⎢ ⎥= − −⎢ ⎥
⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦

 (eq. A-9) 

 

Where: 0 and 0 = the latitude and longitude of the origin of the object. 

 

Finally, the rotation matrix M is applied to the translation vector t to obtain each coordinate xL in 
the local vertical coordinate system with equation A-10: 

 

MtxL =  (eq. A-10) 

 

K.7 Angular Displacements to Linear Displacement 
For WGS84, which is an elliptical representation of the earth, the transformation from angular 
displacements to equivalent linear displacements in a tangential plane is slightly different than 
that for a spherical earth.

K.8 3D Model Coordinate System 
This section describes the transformations required to go to-and-from the DIS/HLA and the CDB 
moving model coordinate systems.

The CDB 3D model coordinate system conventions were presented earlier in Chapter 6. 

 

 
Figure K-2: CDB 3D Model Coordinate System 

 

The DIS coordinate system is used on a HLA network and is represented on the following figure. 

 

 
Figure K-3: DIS Entity18 Coordinate System 

 

The two coordinate systems differ in the axis conventions (Z is up in the CDB while Z is down 
in DIS).  Furthermore, the position of the origin also differs; DIS requires that the origin of its

coordinate system be located at the center of the entity’s bounding box excluding its articulated 
and attached parts19.  The CDB specification uses a different convention. 

 

The transformation from the CDB coordinate system to the DIS coordinate system involves one 
translation followed by two rotations.  The translation represents the offset to the DIS origin as 
defined in chapter 6.  Assume that P0 represents the coordinate of the DIS origin. 

 

),,( 0000 zyxP =  (eq. A-11) 

 

The two rotations are relatively simple.  First, rotate 180° about the X-axis.  This rotation will 
position the Z-axis in its correct position.  Equation A-12 represents this rotation.

Now, if we combine equations A-11, A-12 and A-13, we can transform a point P expressed in 
the CDB coordinate system into point P’ in the DIS coordinate system.  Equation A-14 presents 
the complete transformation. 

 
                                                
19  This definition can be found on page 3 of IEEE Std 1278.1-1995.  Note that the CDB provides the means to store the DIS 

origin within the coordinate system space of the model.

Appendix P 

P. SGI Image File Format 
This document has been annotated to reflect the conventions established by the CDB 
Specification.  Collectively, these conventions are referred to as SGI/CDB.  The conventions 
define how SGI Image files are interpreted by a CDB-compliant SGI Image reader; the stated 
conventions supersede or replace related aspects of this annotated specification.  Unless stated 
otherwise, CDB-compliant SGI Image readers will ignore any data that fails to conform to the 
stated conventions.

The SGI Image File Format

 This is the definitive document describing the SGI image file format.  This  

 is a low level spec that describes the actual byte level format of SGI image 

 files.  On SGI machines the preferred way of reading and writing SGI image 

 files is to use the image library -limage.  This library provides a set 

 of functions that make it easy to read and write SGI images.  If you are  

 on an SGI workstation you can get info on -limage by doing: 

  

     % man 4 rgb 

  

 A note on byte order of values in the SGI image files 

  

     In the following description a notation like bits[7..0] is used to denote

     a range of bits in a binary value.   Bit 0 is the lowest order bit in 

     the value. 

  

     All short values are represented by 2 bytes.  The first byte stores the 

     high order 8 bits of the value: bits[15..8].  The second byte stores 

     the low order 8 bits of the value: bits[7..0]. 

  

  So, this function will read a short value from the file: 

  

      unsigned short getshort(inf) 

      FILE *inf; 

      { 

   unsigned char buf[2]; 

  

   fread(buf,2,1,inf); 

   return (buf[0]<<8)+(buf[1]<<0); 

      } 

  

     All long values are represented by 4 bytes.  The first byte stores the 

     high order 8 bits of the value: bits[31..24].  The second byte stores 

     bits[23..16].  The third byte stores bits[15..8]. The forth byte stores 

     the low order 8 bits of the value: bits[7..0]. 

  

  So, this function will read a long value from the file: 

  

      static long getlong(inf) 

      FILE *inf; 

      { 

   unsigned char buf[4]; 

  

   fread(buf,4,1,inf); 

   return (buf[0]<<24)+(buf[1]<<16)+(buf[2]<<8)+(buf[3]<<0); 

      } 

  

  

 The general structure of an SGI image file is as shown below:

     Here is a description of each field in the image file header:

  MAGIC - This is the decimal value 474 saved as a short. This 

  identifies the file as an SGI image file. 

  

  STORAGE - specifies whether the image is stored using run 

  length encoding (RLE) or not (VERBATIM).   If RLE is used, the value  

        of this byte will be 1.  Otherwise the value of this byte will be 0. 

  The only allowed values for this field are 0 or 1. 

  

  BPC - describes the precision that is used to store each 

  channel of an image.  This is the number of bytes per pixel 

  component.  The majority of SGI image files use 1 byte per  

  pixel component, giving 256 levels.  Some SGI image files use  

  2 bytes per component.  The only allowed values for this field  

  are 1 or 2. 

  

  DIMENSION - described the number of dimensions in the data stored 

  in the image file.  The only allowed values are 1, 2, or 3.  If 

  this value is 1, the image file consists of only 1 channel and  

  only 1 scanline (row).  The length of this scanline is given by the  

  value of XSIZE below.  If this value is 2, the file consists of a  

  single channel with a number of scanlines. The width and height 

  of the image are given by the values of XSIZE and YSIZE below. 

  If this value is 3, the file consists of a number of channels. 

  The width and height of the image are given by the values of  

  XSIZE and YSIZE below.  The number of channels is given by the  

  value of ZSIZE below. 

  

  XSIZE - The width of the image in pixels 

  

  YSIZE - The height of the image in pixels 

  

  ZSIZE - The number of channels in the image.  B/W (greyscale) images  

  are stored as 2 dimensional images with a ZSIZE of 1.  RGB color  

  images are stored as 3 dimensional images with a ZSIZE of 3.  An RGB  

  image with an ALPHA channel is stored as a 3 dimensional image with  

  a ZSIZE of 4.  There are no inherent limitations in the SGI image  

  file format that would preclude the creation of image files with more

  than 4 channels. 

  

  PIXMIN - The minimum pixel value in the image.  The value of 

  0 may be used if no pixel has a value that is smaller than 0. 

  

  PIXMAX - The maximum pixel value in the image.  The value of 

  255 may be used if no pixel has a value that is greater than 255. 

  This is the value that is considered to be full brightness in  

  the image. 

  

  DUMMY - This 4 bytes of data should be set to 0. 

  

  IMAGENAME - An null terminated ascii string of up to 79 characters  

  terminated by a null may be included here.  This is not commonly 

  used. 

  

  COLORMAP - This controls how the pixel values in the file should be 

  interpreted.  It can have one of these four values: 

  

      0:  NORMAL - The data in the channels represent B/W values 

   for images with 1 channel, RGB values for images with 3 

   channels, and RGBA values for images with 4 channels. 

   Almost all the SGI image files are of this type.  

  

      1:  DITHERED - The image will have only 1 channel of data. 

   For each pixel, RGB data is packed into one 8 bit value. 

   3 bits are used for red and green, while blue uses 2 bits. 

   Red data is found in bits[2..0], green data in bits[5..3], 

   and blue data in bits[7..6].  This format is obsolete. 

  

      2:  SCREEN - The image will have only 1 channel of data. 

   This format was used to store color-indexed pixels. 

   To convert the pixel values into RGB values a colormap 

   must be used.  The appropriate color map varies from 

   image to image.  This format is obsolete. 

  

      3:  COLORMAP - The image is used to store a color map from 



Open Geospatial Consortium – Common DataBase Specification

   an SGI machine.  In this case the image is not displayable 

   in the conventional sense. 

  

  DUMMY - This 404 bytes of data should be set to 0. This makes the 

  header exactly 512 bytes. 

  

  

 The Image Data (if not RLE) 

  

     If the image is stored verbatim (without RLE), then image data directly 

     follows the 512 byte header.  The data for each scanline of the first 

     channel is written first.  If the image has more than 1 channel, all 

     the data for the first channel is written, followed by the remaining 

     channels.  If the BPC value is 1, then each scanline is written as XSIZE 

     bytes.  If the BPC value is 2, then each scanline is written as XSIZE  

     shorts.  These shorts are stored in the byte order described above. 

  

  

 The Offset Tables (if RLE) 

  

     If the image is stored using run length encoding, offset tables 

     follow the header that describe what the file offsets are to the  

     RLE for each scanline.  This information only applies if the value  

     for STORAGE above is 1. 

  

             Size  | Type   | Name      | Description    

  

      tablen longs | long   | STARTTAB  | Start table 

      tablen longs | long   | LENGTHTAB | Length table 

  

     One entry in each table is needed for each scanline of RLE data.  The  

     total number of scanlines in the image (tablen) is determined by the 

     product of the YSIZE and ZSIZE.  There are two tables of longs that  

     are written. Each consists of tablen longs of data.  The first 

     table has the file offsets to the RLE data for each scanline in the 

     image.  In a file with more than 1 channel (ZSIZE > 1) this table first  

     has all the offsets for the scanlines in the first channel, followed

     be offsets for the scanlines in the second channel, etc.  The second  

     table has the RLE data length for each scanline in the image.  In a  

     file with more than 1 channel (ZSIZE > 1) this table first has all the  

     RLE data lengths for the scanlines in the first channel, followed 

     be RLE data lengths for the scanlines in the second channel, etc. 

  

     To find the the file offset, and the number of bytes in the RLE data  

     for a particular scanline, these two arrays may be read in and indexed as 

     follows: 

  

  To read in the tables: 

  

      unsigned long *starttab, *lengthtab; 

  

      tablen = YSIZE*ZSIZE*sizeof(long); 

      starttab = (unsigned long *)mymalloc(tablen); 

      lengthtab = (unsigned long *)mymalloc(tablen); 

      fseek(inf,512,SEEK_SET); 

      readlongtab(inf,starttab); 

      readlongtab(ing,lengthtab); 

  

  

  To find the file offset and RLE data length for a scanline: 

  

      rowno is an integer in the range 0 to YSIZE-1 

      channo is an integer in the range 0 to ZSIZE-1 

  

      rleoffset = starttab[rowno+channo*YSIZE] 

      rlelength = lengthtab[rowno+channo*YSIZE] 

      

     It is possible for two identical rows (scanlines) to share compressed  

     data.  A completely white image could be written as a single compressed  

     row and having all table entries point to that row.  Another little hack  

     that should work is if you are writing out a RGB RLE file, and a  

     particular scanline is achromatic (greyscale), you could just make the  

     r, g and b rows point to the same data!!

 The Image Data (if RLE) 

  

     This information only applies if the value for STORAGE above is 1.  If 

     the image is stored using run length encoding, the image data follows 

     the offset tables above.  The RLE data is not in any particular order. 

     The offset tables above are used to locate the rle data for any scanline. 

    

     The RLE data must be read in from the file and expanded into pixel  

     data in the following manner: 

  

     If BPC is 1, then there is one byte per pixel.  In this case the  

     RLE data should be read into an array of chars.  To expand 

     data, the low order seven bits of the first byte: bits[6..0] 

     are used to form a count.  If the high order bit of the first 

     byte is 1: bit[7], then the count is used to specify how many 

     bytes to copy from the RLE data buffer to the destination. 

     Otherwise, if the high order bit of the first byte is 0: bit[7], 

     then the count is used to specify how many times to repeat the  

     value of the following byte, in the destination.  This process 

     continues until a count of 0 is found.  This should decompress 

     exactly XSIZE pixels. 

  

  Here is example code to decompress a scanline: 

  

      expandrow(optr,iptr,z) 

      unsigned char *optr, *iptr; 

      int z; 

      { 

   unsigned char pixel, count; 

       

   optr += z; 

   while(1) { 

       pixel = *iptr++; 

       if ( !(count = (pixel & 0x7f)) ) 

    return; 

       if(pixel & 0x80) { 

    while(count--) {

        *optr = *iptr++; 

        optr+=4; 

    } 

       } else { 

    pixel = *iptr++; 

    while(count--) { 

        *optr = pixel; 

        optr+=4; 

    } 

       } 

   } 

      } 

  

     If BPC is 2, there is one short (2 bytes) per pixel.  In this  

     case the RLE data should be read into an array of shorts.  To  

     expand data, the low order seven bits of the first short: bits[6..0] 

     are used to form a count.  If bit[7] of the first short is 1, then  

     the count is used to specify how many shorts to copy from the RLE  

     data buffer to the destination.  Otherwise, if bit[7] of the first  

     short is 0, then the count is used to specify how many times to  

     repeat the value of the following short, in the destination.  This  

     process proceeds until a count of 0 is found.  This should decompress 

     exactly XSIZE pixels.  Note that the byte order of short data in 

     the input file should be used, as described above. 

  

  

 Implementation notes 

  

     Implementation of both RLE and VERBATIM format for images with 

     BPC of 1 is required since the great majority of SGI images are in 

     this format.  Support for images with a 2 BPC is encouraged. 

  

     If the ZSIZE of an image is 1, it is assumed to represent B/W 

     values.  If the ZSIZE is 3, it is assumed to represent RGB data, 

     and if ZSIZE is 4, it is assumed to contain RGB data with alpha. 

  

     The origin for all SGI images is the lower left hand corner.  The

     first scanline (row 0) is always the bottom row of the image. 

  

 Naming Conventions 

  

     On SGI systems, SGI image files end with the extension .bw if 

     they are B/W images, they end in .rgb if they contain RGB image 

     data, and end in .rgba if they are RGB images with alpha channel. 

  

     Sometimes the .sgi extension is used as well. 

  

 An example 

  

This program will write out a valid B/W SGI image file: 

  

#include “stdio.h” 

  

#define IXSIZE      (23) 

#define IYSIZE      (15)

R. Derived Datasets within the CDB 
As seen throughout this document, the CDB Specification provides all the means and 
mechanisms to populate all the simulation datasets without involving data duplication by using 
Industry Standards.  However, there are situations where a specific dataset information type 
needs to be derived from another existing one in order to specialize further the information into 
another dataset type or form. 

This consideration becomes a grey area where the off-line tools’ capability and the run-time 
simulation clients’ performance levels enforces this data derivation. 

It is such a case with the Mip-Map data, Min-Max Elevation datat, Tile Presence data, RCS data, 
and Raster Material data for example.

Elevation 
Dataset 

In order to produce the various Level Of Details 
within the Elevation Dataset, it is often necessary to 
over-sample or sub-sample a primary set of data 
values.  Since those values within the LOD hierarchy 
may come from a single data source, the LODs can be 
seen as derived information which can better 
accommodate the client needs based on their 
performance level. 

Elevation LODs 

Elevation 
Dataset 

For clients that need to compute line of sights (LOS) 
between simulation entities spread across a vast terrain 
area, it is imperative to have a fast way of knowing the 
minimum and maximum elevations within a tile 
without loading the entire elevation data grid. The 
min/max elevation dataset can be used to ensure a fast 
pre-determination of entities occultation state with the 
terrain. The min/max data is stored in the form of a 
quad-tree pyramid and is based on the area covered at 
the given depth level of the quad-tree. For example, 
for the maximum dataset the top will contain the 
maximum for the whole of the geocell, the next 
pyramid level contains maximum data for each the 
quarter geocells and so on. Similarly for the minimum 
the top represents the minimum for the whole of the

geocell going down as for maximums. Currently the 
pyramid size is fixed and goes down to level 9 which 
covers areas that are approximately 256x256 meters 
square; note that the depth level can be modified to a 
finer or coarser level but level 9 is suggested as a 
reasonable compromise of performance vs. storage. A 
tool will pre-determine the minimum and maximum 
elevations within a geocell’s elevations and generate 
the quad-trees described previously; note that the tool 
will use all of the elevation data that is present in the 
elevation dataset to determine the maximums or 
minimums in a given area. The tool will provide Min-
Max values to client devices through the Min-Max 
Elevation datasets in the CDB. 

Vector 
Datasets 
(Point, Lineal 
and Areal 
Features) 

The Max Culture Height data is produced for clients 
that need to compute line of sights (LOS) between 
simulation entities spread across a vast terrain area 
that take into account the maximum cultural feature 
heights. The dataset helps rapidly assess an 
intersection status of line-of-sight with cultural 
features.  This dataset is derived from the Vector 
Datasets of the CDB for corresponding tiles. The 
storage is done via a quad-tree similar to that of the 
min/max elevation the top of the pyramid represents 
the height of the highest cultural feature in the dataset 
going down to a suggested depth level of 9.  

Max Culture Height 

3D Model 
(GT, GS, MM) 
Datasets 

The polar diagram data (covering all aspect angles) of 
the RCS dataset for Geotypical, Geospecific or 
Moving Models cannot readily be computed at run-
time due to the complex mathematical computing 
algorithms and resources required to determine the 
Electro-Magnetic Energy absorption levels by the 
model’s materials, the corner reflections, the multi-
path reflections, EM parameters (frequency, 
polarization) effects, and so on.  Therefore, off-line 
COTS tools are used to analyze the 3D model 
geometry and its materials in order to produce the 
RCS dataset specifically for different frequencies and 
polarizations.

S. Default Read and Write values to be used by Simulator Client-Devices 
As seen throughout this document, the CDB Specification provides guidelines with 
respect to default values in cases where no data could be read from the CDB for 
requested datasets.  Those default parameters are captured in a Metadata file within 
the CDB.  The Table below summarizes all the Default Parameters Names and the 
suggested initial values to be used by client-devices.  In cases where the default 
parameter would be missing altogether from \CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml, Client-
Devices shall use the “Default Value” found in the fourth column.  A “Read” default 
refers to the value being assumed while reading the CDB data.  A “Write” default 
refers to the value being written to the file when content-generation tools have partial 
source data.
