i. Abstract 
This OGC discussion paper presents the results of the GeoPackage Plugfest. In this 
initiative, participants had the opportunity to evaluate the compliance and interoperability 
of software that produces and consumes GeoPackages containing tiled raster data.  

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

ogcdoc, OGC document, GeoPackage, GPKG, plugfest, interoperability, tiles 

iii. Preface 
The GeoPackage Encoding Standard defines an open, non-proprietary, platform-
independent SQLite container for distribution and direct use of geospatial data, including 
vector features and tile matrix sets of earth images and raster maps at various scales. 
OGC members and other non-members are invited to participate in a Plugfest to test the 
use of the GeoPackage (GPKG) standard as a container for tiled imagery and to produce 
a shareable GPKG file with tiled imagery content.

Plugfest 
A Plugfest is an event where vendors cooperatively test (and possibly refine) their OGC-
based products in a hands-on engineering setting. Plugfests are used to (1) assess the 
degree to which different products in the marketplace interoperate together based on their 
implementation of OGC standards, and (2) advance the interoperability of geospatial 
products and services based on OGC standards in general or within specific communities.

4. Plugfest Results 

The GeoPackage Plugfest participants performed a series of interoperability experiments. 
The goal of these sessions was to test OGC GeoPackages submitted to the Plugfest to 
determine if they comply with the OGC GeoPackage encoding standard and are 
interoperable across several software platforms. Compliance testing was performed using 
an executable test suite (ETS) built by RGi. 

Following are the details of the four items identified in the scope. 



7 
Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Ø Whether providers produce compliant GeoPackages containing tiled raster data 

Success. Providers were generally able to produce GeoPackages that came close to 
standard compliance. The compliance issues that we observed were typically minor and 
did not appear to pose a threat to interoperability.  

Ø Whether clients behave as expected after loading compliant GeoPackages 

Issue. Compliant GeoPackages were not necessarily interoperable. There were numerous 
instances of tiles not displaying as expected in integrated clients. We believe this may be 
due to confusion regarding how tiles are to be indexed. The GeoPackages assessed for the 
Plugfest were generally created in two steps: 1) native imagery is tiled as JPEG or PNG 
images and structured as tile pyramids such as those defined for Tile Map Service (TMS) 
or Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) and 2) these tile structures are then re-indexed to 
meet the requirements of the GeoPackage standard. GeoPackage producers must first 
establish the tile origin (i.e. upper left vs. lower left) of the initial tile structure and then 
may need to correctly translate from globally referenced, absolute tile index numbers 
(e.g. TMS) to the GeoPackage tile index numbers which are referenced relative to the 
data bounding box and which restart at zero for each zoom level.   

Ø What changes need to be made to the GeoPackage implementation standard to 
improve interoperability 

Suggested Changes. To mitigate future GeoPackage interoperability issues we believe 
that implementation profiles should be created to ensure that GeoPackages serve their 
purpose and are fit for intended use. Implementation profiles should align to specific tile 
scale sets. For example, a Web Mercator profile would be used with the 
GoogleMapsCompatible (urn:ogc:def:wkss:OGC:1.0:GoogleMapsCompatible) tile scale 
set (see Appendix E.4 of [OGC 07-057r7]) 1.  

An implementation profile should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the 
following: 

1. Supported Spatial Reference System(s) 
2. Tile sizes 
3. Zoom levels (names and meters/pixel) 
4. Tile pyramid design (including indexing scheme) 
5. Tile alignment 
6. Tile matrix extent 

Ø What testing methods are needed to ensure interoperability 

Not successful. This item is unresolved as we were unable to attain substantial 
interoperability between implementations.  

                                                
1 A National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) implementation profile is currently being developed 
under a separate initiative. 



8 
Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

We believe that another interoperability experiment should be performed, ideally in 
conjunction with the development of one or more implementation profiles. Contributors 
to the U.S. National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG) are currently developing a 
GPKG implementation profile. We encourage NSG developers (and any other 
communities of interest that develop an implementation profile) to conduct 
interoperability experiments as their profile is advanced.  

Developers may refer to the GPKG produced by RGi, which passed all of the Plugfest 
testing. It is available on the on the OGC Portal2 along with available tests. Additionally, 
it has been linked on geopackage.org3.

Annex A – Experiments 

This section documents the details of the two interoperability experiments that were 
performed.  

Note that since this plugfest did not attain the desired results, we will not publish the 
identities of the GeoPackage providers (other than RGi as mentioned above). We see no 
benefit to identifying these organizations when the lack of desired interoperability is 
directly attributable to the standard itself.  

A.1 Experiment 1 

The GeoPackage Plugfest Working Group performed interoperability testing on 14 and 
17 November 2014. Eight GeoPackages containing raster tile data were provided to the 
working group for testing. As summarized in Table 1, the following tests were 
conducted: 

1. Inspect the GPKG in a SQLite viewer 
2. Load the GPKG in DARPA TransApp Panthr Tiles v4.8.2.5 
3. Inspect the available zoom levels in Panthr Tiles 
4. Perform GeoLocation in Panthr Tiles 
5. Load the GPKG in Nett Warrior 2.0.6.x 
6. Load the GPKG in  ERDC GPKG Viewer vx.x.x 
7. Perform GeoLocation in the ERDC GPKG Viewer 
8. Test the GPKG using v1.0 of the ETS

5 This GPKG did not have any tiled data and therefore was not tested further. 

6 In some cases the Geolocation appears to be displaced 1km to the West. The reason for this was not clear.

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

As presented in Table 2, seven of the eight (87.5%) GeoPackages violated one or more of 
the requirements in the OGC GeoPackage specification. Only one provider passed all 
tests but four providers passed at least some of the tests.  Most of the standard 
requirements that were violated were relatively minor and should not affect 
interoperability, but larger issues remain in determining how the bounding box is used 
and in standardizing the tile-indexing scheme.

In addition, defects were discovered in the client applications. These were reported to the 
vendors. 

A.2 Experiment 2 

After reporting the results of Experiment 1, the GeoPackage Plugfest Working Group 
requested that the original eight data providers produce updated GeoPackages to address 
requirement failures. Three of the data providers responded to this data call, and the 
GeoPackage Plugfest participants performed a second round of interoperability testing on 
23 January 2015. The following tests were conducted: 

1. Inspect the GPKG in a SQLite viewer 
2. Load the GPKG in DARPA TransApp Panthr Tiles v4.8.2.5 
3. Inspect the available zoom levels in Panthr Tiles 
4. Perform GeoLocation in Panthr Tiles 
5. Load the GPKG in Nett Warrior 2.0.6.x 
6. Load the GPKG in  ERDC GPKG Viewer vx.x.x 
7. Perform GeoLocation in the ERDC GPKG Viewer 
8. Test the GPKG using v1.1 of the ETS 

Three GeoPackages containing raster tile data were provided to the working group for 
testing. These were tested as summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. None of the updated 
GeoPackages passed all tests.  All of these GeoPackages are very close to meeting the 
OGC GeoPackage Standard, thus the major interoperability problem continues to be 
inconsistencies in how the tile pyramids are indexed.
