Abstract 

This engineering report describes the results of the Soil Data Interoperability Experiment 
(the IE) conducted under the auspices of the OGC Agriculture Domain Working Group in 
2015. Soil data exchange and analysis is compromised by the lack of a widely agreed 
international standard for the exchange of data describing soils and the sampling and 
analytical activities relating to them. Previous modeling activities in Europe and 
Australasia have not yielded models that satisfy many of the data needs of global soil 
scientists, data custodians and users. This IE evaluated existing models and proposed a 
common core model, including a GML/XML schema, which was tested through the 
deployment of OGC web services and demonstration clients. IE time constraints and 
limited participant resources precluded extensive modeling activities. However, the 
resulting model should form the core of a more comprehensive model to be developed by 
a future OGC Soil Data Standards Working Group. 

Business Value 

Modern digital mapping and modeling techniques are of huge value in better 
understanding our imperfectly sampled soil resource. However they depend on dispersed, 
inconsistent and difficult to access digital data. Modern, harmonized and interoperable 
information systems are required to quickly and efficiently integrate these data into a 
consistent set of soil data for analysis and decision making.

OGC	Soil	Data	Interoperability	Experiment	

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC®) engineering report describes the use cases, 
modeling, implementation, results and findings of the Soil Interoperability Experiment. 
This OGC® document is applicable to the sharing of soil data. The document reviews 
previous work, defines the conceptual, logical and physical models created by those 
involved in the interoperability experiment and provides an overview of the 
demonstration tools. 

The International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) Working Group on Soil Information 
Standards (WGSIS) is working to consolidate the various existing soil information 
models and reconcile them into a single language for the exchange of globally consistent 
soil information. The WGSIS chose to progress this work through an OGC 
Interoperability Experiment.

5 Soil Interoperability Experiment Overview 

The promotion of sustainable soil and land management is critical to ensuring productive 
food systems, improved rural livelihoods and a sustainable healthy environment. A 
number of large environmental and production challenges have been identified as 
ongoing threats to the sustainability of soil resources across the world. These threats are 
complex, difficult to resolve, and are inextricably linked across a number of 
environmental and land management domains. The need for an improved understanding 
of soil distribution, function and state is important to support science and policy 
development and to improve productivity in a sustainable manner. This understanding 
needs to be underpinned by soil data and information that can be organized, aggregated 
and made accessible in a consistent, granular and consumable form. 

Modern digital mapping and modeling techniques are of huge value in providing a more 
quantitative estimate of the variation of properties across the imperfectly sampled soil 
resource. However, they depend on dispersed, inconsistent and difficult to access digital 
data. It is increasingly clear that modern, harmonized and interoperable information 
systems are required to integrate these data into a consistent set of soil data. Various 
initiatives have started work on this by defining soil information models. Examples 
include: the European INSPIRE, e-SOTER and ISO 28258:2013 [6] (ISO SoilML) 
standards; the international GlobalSoilMap consortium, and the Australian and New 
Zealand ANZSoilML projects. The UN FAO Global Soil Partnership recognizes the 
value of all of these projects, particularly for Pillars 4 (Global Soil Information System) 
and 5 (Harmonization). Yet despite these endeavors, soil scientists still have a situation 
where they must reconcile multiple systems that often attempt to do the same thing. 

The International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) Working Group on Soil Information 
Standards (WGSIS) is working to consolidate these information models and reconcile 
them into a single language for the exchange of globally consistent soil information. The 
WGSIS aimed to progress the work by running an Open Geospatial Consortium 
Interoperability Experiment. 

This experiment had the goal of defining a simplified, yet implementable, soil 
information model (referred to as SoilIEML for the purposes of this document) by 
consolidating core concepts and features from existing standards, and testing the result 
(through working implementations) against an agreed set of use cases for the exchange 
and analysis of soil data.

Participants were not expected to change their information systems; instead they provided 
web services using a common exchange language and protocols used to communicate 
with all components in the system. Those undertaking the experiment gained valuable 
insights that can be used to improve existing information systems or fast-track the 
development of new systems. 

Harmonizing inconsistent data is a time-consuming process – some estimates state that 
80% of a scientist’s time can be occupied getting data into a state where it can be 
analyzed (’data wrangling’).  This process must be repeated with each project. This 
initiative aims to reverse that by allowing data acquisition to be automated as much as 
possible, allowing more time to be spent understanding and managing our soils. 

6 Objectives of the Soil Interoperability Experiment 

The objectives of the Soil Interoperability Experiment were: 

— Further develop and test a GML compatible information model for soil features, 
based on existing international initiatives; 

— Seek participation by a number of soil agencies from across the world to establish 
data services using the defined model; 

— Demonstrate delivery of standardized soil data services from multiple and disparate 
sources, and the use of these services within a number of user focused applications; 
and 

— Prepare an OGC/IUSS engineering report with intent to develop it into a data 
specification subsequent to the IE. 

The Technical Approach for this Interoperability Experiment followed existing principles 
for developing information models as exemplified by GeoSciML, GWML2 and 
WaterML2. 

Testing involved: 

— Evaluation of the GML-UML against GML principles; 

— Validation of the XSD;  

— Evaluation of the functionality of web services; 

— Evaluation of instance documents against use-cases; and 

— Evaluation of data exchange between participants.

7 Use Cases 

Four use-cases were developed for the IE to constrain the requirements of the information 
model and test implementations. The use cases addressed scenarios commonly 
encountered by providers and users of soil data. The use cases are described in detail in 
Annex A. 

Use cases 1 to 3 involve the delivery of data describing soil features using web services 
while use case 4 involves the use of algorithms or other processing methods to generate 
new data. A fifth use case addressing soil type mapping was proposed but not developed 
due to a lack of resources. 

7.1 Use Case 1: Soil Data Integration 

This use case involves using the schema as a canonical structure into which 
heterogeneous soil data formats are transformed and published. An example application 
is the exchange of comprehensive soil description, sampling and analytical data captured 
at a site. 

7.2 Use Case 2: Soil Sensor Data 

This use case involves identifying the location and properties of sensors monitoring 
dynamic soil properties, and the provision of the measurements made at those sites, to 
inform interested parties about local soil conditions. An example application is the 
provision of soil moisture monitoring data to control variable rate precision irrigation. 

7.3 Use Case 3: Soil Property Modeling and Predictions 

This use case involves the provision of high resolution estimates of functional soil 
properties generated using digital soil mapping techniques to support the development 
and implementation of policies for the management of the soil resources. An example 
application is the publication of the world-wide soil property predictions made by the 
GlobalSoilMap project (http://www.globalsoilmap.net/). 

7.4 Use Case 4: Pedo-transfer Functions 

This use case involves the delivery of observed and interpreted soil properties (by soil 
type and/or by spatial distribution) in a standard format that allows the use of pedo-
transfer functions - algorithms that calculate additional interpreted soil properties. An 
example application is the provision of data to a processing service that predicts the 
values of relevant functional properties of a soil to inform farm management practices.

In a fully interoperable system there would be interdependencies between the use cases. 

1. Use case 4 would use data published by services implemented to provide data 
according to use cases 1, 2 and 3. 

2. Use case 3 would include data from services supporting use cases 1, 2 and 4 (along 
with other environmental datasets) when generating the predictions. 

8 Comparison of Existing Soil Information Models 

Various national and international initiatives have worked on information models to 
support the exchange of soil data. This experiment intended to reconcile core concepts 
and features of these models into a single coherent, fully attributed, implementable, albeit 
provisional, standard. The five models that were reviewed in this IE were: 

1. Australia and New Zealand Soil Mark-up Language (ANZSoilML); 

2. e-SOTER Soil and Terrain Mark-up Language (SoTerML); 

3. INSPIRE D2.8.III.3 Data Specification on Soil (INSPIRE Soil); 

4. ISO 28258:2013 Soil quality – Digital exchange of soil-related data (ISO SoilML); 
and 

5. IUSS/ISO ‘Wageningen Proposal’ (a variation of 4 with reference to 1, 2 and 3). 

This section provides an overview of the models, comparing their breadth of content and 
modeling technique. A summary of each model can be found in Annex B. 

8.1 Basis for comparison 

The models were compared according to their scope, the modeling techniques and 
patterns used in their definition, whether they are readily available and implemented, and 
the context in which they have been used (e.g. production or prototype). Only documents 
that could reasonably be considered normative and were of unambiguous origin were 
used for the comparison (UML models and XML Schema Documents). 

Scope refers to the breadth of information captured by each model. As each model has a 
different level of abstraction and conceptual base an external basis for comparison was 
necessary. The FAO Guidelines for Soil Description [3], with additional guidance from 
the USDA Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils [11], was adapted to define and 
group the key dimensions of a soil. The comparison is only intended to be indicative of 
scope and does not imply strict conformance to the FAO and USDA guidelines. 

The criteria for comparison can be grouped into eight categories: 



OGC 16-088r1 

14 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

1. Site registration: identity, location, timing and other metadata about sampling sites; 

2. Soil formation: environmental and human factors influencing the formation of the 
soil; 

3. Soil description: physical, chemical and organic character of a soil; 

4. Sampling: collection of physical samples; 

5. Observation: field or laboratory measurements of soil properties; 

6. Classification: categorization of soil and horizons according to formal taxonomies; 

7. Vocabularies: systems for managing terms and their definitions; and 

8. Mapping: mapping the distribution of soils according to their type. 

Modeling approach refers to how the model was defined. Models may be: 

— comprehensive, attempting to cover as many dimensions of the soil as possible and 
favoring hard-typed properties (where properties are explicitly defined and bound to 
classes). Additional properties may be specified using a soft-typing mechanism 
(values presented as property-value-pairs where the property refers to a dynamic 
register of properties); 

— targeted, hard-typing a selected set of essential properties while relying on soft-typing 
for a significant set of properties; or 

— framework, a model that simply provides a framework of classes. Soft-typed 
properties are used almost exclusively. 

Accessibility refers to the availability of the model (UML models, XML schema, 
specification documents and other artefacts) in terms of access constraints or charges for 
access. 

Implementation readiness attempts to capture whether a model may be implemented 
(e.g. deployed as web services) with comparative ease (high), some difficulty but 
minimal technical impediment (medium) or with significant effort and/or technical 
impediments (low). 

Implementation shows whether a standard has been implemented, either as a prototype 
in a production environment.

8.2 Comparison of models 

Table 1 is a comparison of the modeling approach and scope of each information model 
and Table 2 summarizes matters of implementation. No existing model was accepted by 
the IE participants as the primary basis for a soil information model, due to: 

— Lack of agreement on the concepts in each of the models; 

— Incompleteness due to a reliance on soft-typing. 

The soil model developed as part of this IE (SoilIEML), although not part of the analysis 
of existing models, is included in Table 1 for completeness. 

Of the models, ANZSoilML was the most comprehensive and explicit model. However, 
it was also the most difficult to understand as it relied on a single model for conceptual 
and physical purposes. In contrast, SoTerML and INSPIRE Soil were less-comprehensive 
as they took a targeted modeling approach, explicitly defining some properties, but 
relying on soft-typing for most soil properties. ISO SoilML and the modified ISO/IUSS 
Wageningen proposal are the least comprehensive models, instead providing a 
framework of the highest level concepts, without detailing their associated properties. 

Soft-typing, allowing generic property-value pairs rather than explicitly specifying 
property-data type values, has value in physical models used to serialize the data, but at 
the abstract level simply defers the problem of model definition and therefore encourages 
independent proliferation of models and implementations. Given substantial effort can be 
required to agree on even simple property lists, the value of these framework and targeted 
models is limited for many communities as it hampers fast and consistent adoption. A 
comprehensive and explicit model is required to reduce the need for this work and to 
support consistent implementations. This may be accompanied by a more flexible 
implementation that is nonetheless constrained by the conceptual model. 

Explicit conceptual models can be published in normative feature catalogs or data type 
registers but we could find no obvious authoritative examples for the INSPIRE or 
SoTerML standards. Searches did uncover a Semantic Web European Soil Thesaurus 
(https://secure.umweltbundesamt.at/soil/) but its status is unclear. Meanwhile, ISO 
SoilML explicitly defers the problem, expecting ‘… that every data provider extends 
SoilML classes with properties which are suitable for his or her data model, or simply fill 
the attributes for which (s)he has data.’ [7]. 

Soft-typing also causes problems when the property values are complex and require 
structured data types. Also, many properties describe material components of a soil and 
need to be related to one another to fully describe the structure, genesis or function of a 
soil. Without clear guidance as to the organization of these complex types interoperability 
breaks down. As such, soft-typed models are only reliable for the provision of simple 
property-value statements about a soil, and even then necessitating the use of well-
defined property registers.

The ANZSoilML, INSPIRE Soil and eSoTerML models are implementation ready (see 
Annex B for details), with GML schema for the logical models available at no cost. 
Production ANZSoilML services have been deployed in both Australia and New Zealand. 
INSPIRE Soil and ISO SoilML have been implemented for the European Union GS Soil 
project (http://www.eurogeosurveys.org/projects/gssoil/). However, the ISO SoilML 
cannot be implemented as is. There is no normative schema or register of soil properties 
and no mechanism for providing the property values. Properties are expected to be 
assigned to classes in other application and XML schema that extend ISO 28258:2013 – 
for example, the GS Soil project created a ‘provider specific’ extension of the schema for 
portal services [1].

9 Soil Interoperability Experiment Information Models 

9.1 Introduction 

As there was no suitable starting model selected from existing candidates, a compromise 
model was developed using classes and patterns from the existing models wherever 
possible. The initial focus for modeling was on supporting the IE use cases but the IE 
Participants were mindful of allowing extension to support soil mapping use cases.  

With only a 6-month time frame available for the Soil IE, and with the need to be able to 
map multiple data providers’ data to the model, implement services and develop 
demonstration clients, minimal soil data modeling was carried out. To constrain the 
model’s scope, the selection of properties to be assigned to soil classes was based on the 
specifications of the GlobalSoilMap consortium [4], with the intention to allow the model 
to expand in a modular fashion. 

Three models were produced by the IE. 

1. A UML conceptual model defining the classes and properties needed to 
comprehensively describe a soil resource according to the needs of the IE use cases. 
This model is technology independent. 

2. A UML logical model converting the conceptual model into an ISO19109:2005 
compliant application schema and formally importing models from other OGC 
specifications: ISO 19156:2011 – Observations and Measurements (O&M) and OGC 
15-043r3 – the Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements. 

3. An XML physical model defining the encoding of data using Geography Mark-up 
Language according to the ISO19136:2007. 

9.1.1 Modeling Principles 

To constrain modeling activity and help ensure that the model defined was not disruptive 
(conforming closely to existing OGC standards) or parochial (recognizing that soil 
scientists must integrate data from many environmental domains), the group defined a set 
of guiding principles, including: 

— Open publication of the results (UML, XSD) once approved through the OGC 
process; 

— Open development of the model, subject to appropriate agreements with the OGC; 

— Re-use of existing models wherever possible (for example Observations and 
Measurements, Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements, GeoSciML); 
and 



OGC 16-088r1 

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 19 
 

— If an existing model does not meet project needs, then work with the relevant 
community to address issues before resorting to an extension or branch of the model. 

The motivation for the principles was twofold: 

— To ensure consistency of data types across domains - soil is a function of geology, 
climate, topography, and biology, and pedologists must aggregate these data during 
analysis; and 

— To ease process of deployment – a client developed for geology or climate 
observations encoded as O&M can be used for soil observations without modification 
(other than dealing with domain specific values). 

There was a simplification of models from the conceptual to logical to physical 
viewpoints when classes explicitly defined at a higher level could be realized without loss 
of information by a single class. This is an equivalent practice to O&M’s virtual typing 
strategy. 

9.1.2 Treatment of Mandatory Properties 

In most cases cardinality constraints on properties and associations were removed in the 
logical and physical model. This allowed the definition of a strict conceptual model that 
was very clear about the properties and associations needed to comprehensively and 
meaningfully describe a resource, but permitted a terse digital encoding of data when 
necessary. 

Conceptually, a distinction is made between properties that are mandatory (without them 
the data has no meaning) and mandatory but voidable (they should be provided but may 
not be for some reason). In the translation to the logical and physical models, mandatory 
properties must remain so, but voidable properties become optional. It is up to the 
community deploying the services to define implementation profiles that define which 
properties must be present in that context. 

Providers can then deploy services that can lie on an appropriate continuum of use case 
support from comprehensive encodings (where all data are provided and reasons are 
provided if data are missing) to terse encodings (where only the bare minimum of data 
required for a specific application are transmitted). Applications may also switch between 
the two, requesting a terse encoding to display property values, but using a 
comprehensive data service where appropriate, such as to explore meta-data about how, 
when and to what quality a value was generated, for dataset exchange or when sending 
data on to web processing services. Profiles identifying which aspects of the logical 
model services are expected to provide will require further community agreement. 



OGC 16-088r1

9.1.3 Observations as a Data-type 

Throughout the model the Observation class is used as the data-type for estimated 
property values, allowing them to be attributed with meta-data about the value’s 
provenance and quality. This is important as a soil property may be measured in several 
ways, to differing levels of quality, and both affect how values are interpreted or 
processed. 

Using O&M to explicitly decouple procedures, properties and results keeps the number 
of properties defined in the model manageable. Otherwise, the common practice of 
defining a property as a combination of the phenomenon observed, how it was measured, 
for example pH_NaCl and pH_KCl (both describe soil pH, but using different 
procedures), causes significant increase in properties defined. This not only introduces an 
inconsistency with O&M, but also reduces interoperability and creates a governance 
overhead, requiring the core information model to be updated for newly developed 
processes. 

9.2 Conceptual Model 

The conceptual model is designed as a technology neutral representation of the semantics 
of the soil domain. It is defined using UML and describes four aspects of the domain: 

1. the description and classification of soil; 

2. the soil profile; 

3. sampling and field/laboratory observations; and 

4. sensor-based monitoring of dynamic soil properties. 

In accordance with the use cases defined for this Interoperability Experiment it excludes: 

— soil mapping; and 

— landscape, land-use, climate and vegetation data (these are recognized as important, 
but best modelled in collaboration with experts from those domains). 

A set of utility classes was defined in this model to provide placeholders for complex 
data types and classes and are described in Annex C. 

A soil (Figure 1) is a body of unconsolidated mineral and organic material developed 
through soil forming processes near the surface of the earth.  It is composed of horizons 
defined according to their physical, chemical or biological characteristics. Horizons are 
given a designation according to their character and position and a soil can then be 
classified according to one of a number of soil taxonomies addressing a soil’s form or 
function. 



OGC 16-088r1 

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 21 
 

A description of a soil comprising a vertical section of horizons is called a soil profile 
(Figure 2). Soil profiles usually describe a sequence at a sampling location (for example, 
an excavation) but this definition may be extended to include aggregate descriptions 
(such as a soil profile class) of the expected variation of soil properties over a mapped 
area. 

Parts of a soil may be extracted and analyzed, either immediately in the field, or by 
subsequent analysis of a physical sample in a laboratory (Figure 3). It is essential to be 
able to record the method of sampling and analysis, and the quality or uncertainty of the 
resulting measurement. The results of these measurements may be presented and used in 
their own right or be incorporated into a soil description. 

In contrast to inherent soil properties that change very little, certain soil properties change 
in response to external forces over measurable (human-scale) periods of time. These 
dynamic properties are essential to understanding soil, and broader environmental

Figure 5 — Class model for the description and classification of soil. 

	
9.2.1 Soil Description 

Soil features (Figure 5) are designed to describe and classify a volume of soil and its 
horizons. The soil may be described as a whole (SO_Soil) or according to horizons 
(SO_Horizon). Both are sub-classes of the abstract class SO_SoilFeature, which provides 
classes to capture composition according to soil size fractions (SO_Component) and, 
although not tested in this IE, the relationships between soils and horizons 
(SO_SoilFeatureRelationship). 

9.2.1.1 SO_SoilFeature 

The abstract SO_SoilFeature class is a conceptual feature that exists coherently in the 
world. It corresponds with a soil body, comprising a set of similar soil profiles with a 
mappable distribution in some soil landscape, or a soil profile or its constituent parts. The 
implemented SO_SoilFeature instance acts as the description package. ANZSoilML, 
following patterns established in GeoSciML, classifies the SO_SoilFeature description

according to its purpose as an ‘instance’ (capturing an observation), ‘typical norm’ 
(capturing a description of the expected range of property values in a soil body), or 
‘defining norm’ (capturing the necessary criteria to be classified as a particular class of 
soil).  In contrast, INSPIRE uses separate classes to distinguish observed descriptions 
from derived descriptions. Neither option was tested during the IE.

Although these represent only a limited set of soil properties commonly recorded, they 
were considered important for the IE use cases providing a variety of data types to test 
encodings. 

9.2.1.3 SO_Horizon 

The Soil Science Glossary defines a soil horizon as a “layer of soil or soil material 
approximately parallel to the land surface and differing from adjacent genetically related 
layers in physical, chemical, and biological properties or characteristics such as color, 
structure, texture, consistency, kinds and number of organisms present, degree of acidity 
or alkalinity, etc.”

9.2.1.6 SO_SoilFeatureRelationship (proposed) 

A SO_SoilFeatureRelationship class was proposed but not tested. This captures 
relationships between soils and/or horizons. These include spatial and temporal 
associations, or aggregation of soils into collections like map complexes. Participants in 
relationships play roles (e.g. ‘overlies’, ‘truncates’, ‘member’). The design is based on 
the GeoSciML GeologicFeatureRelationship feature type and can be extended to provide 
additional information, for example, a boundary relationship between two horizons could 
capture the distinctness of the boundary.

9.2.2 Soil Sampling and Observations 

The sampling and observation model (Figure 6) has been designed to make extensive use 
of the OGC Observations and Measurements model [ISO 19156:2011]. The 
sampledFeature or featureOfInterest will be a SO_Soil or SO_Horizon as defined in this 
model. Domain specific classes have been added for informative purposes to show how 
concepts describing the sampling strategy, many of them not unique to the soil domain, 
map on to the O&M model. The O&M abstract specification provides a full description 
of the model. 

9.2.2.1 SamplingFeature 

O&M defines a sampling feature (SamplingFeature) as a 'feature which is involved in 
making observations concerning a domain feature. EXAMPLE Station, transect, section 
or specimen.’ They may be spatially constrained (SpatialSamplingFeature) when 
‘observations are made to estimate properties of a geospatial feature, in particular where 
the value of a property varies within the scope of the feature...‘. Specimens are ‘a 
physical sample, obtained for observation(s) normally carried out ex-situ, sometimes in a 
laboratory.’ 

Four informative sub-types of a SpatialSamplingFeature were defined to show how it 
encompasses common artefacts of soil sampling strategies: the soil survey (SO_Survey), 
site (SO_Site), plot (SO_Plot) and a simple marker locating a sampling event 
(SO_Station). An additional subtype (SO_Layer) was added for circumstances where an 
arbitrary layer of the soil with some lateral extent is sampled. An explicit distinction is 
made between these sampling layers and a layer within the soil, which is defined by some 
environmental process, or other character of the soil, but is not a soil horizon. This later 
concept has not been modelled but could be defined as per the MaterialLayer class in the 
ISO/IUSS ‘Wageningen Proposal’.

Figure 6 — Soil sampling and observation class model 

	
The SO_Sample class highlights that the common use of the term ‘sample’ within the soil 
community is equivalent to a Specimen in ISO19156:2011. 

Two informative properties were defined for soil sampling features to reinforce their 
importance to a description: depth (the location of the sampling feature relative to the top 
of the soil); and representativePoint (a point marker used to locate a sampling feature, 
which itself may have a greater or more complicated extent – captured by the shape 
property). These properties are not unique to the soil domain. 



OGC 16-088r1

9.2.2.2 Observation 

O&M defines an Observation as ‘an act associated with a discrete time instant or period 
through which a number, term or other symbol is assigned to a phenomenon. It involves 
application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process 
chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with respect to the 
sampling location. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property 
of some feature.’ 

In the model the procedure value is an abstract class (Process) but data describing a 
documented methodology or algorithm can be provided by reference to terms (for 
example using SKOS Concepts) in a process register, or the Timeseries Profile of 
Observations and Measurements has defined a concrete ObservationProcess class that can 
be used to describe a piece of equipment. 

9.2.3 Soil Profile 

The soil profile (SO_SoilProfile, Figure 7) is a fundamental concept in soil science, 
describing the character of a soil as a vertical sequence of soil horizons. The soil profile 
is also commonly used as a proxy for the soil itself, as well as a method of sampling the 
soil. Separating these various uses of the term ‘soil profile’ proved contentious during the 
modeling work conducted in the IE. 

Soil profiles are primarily used to describe a soil at a single location - this reflects the 
difficulty in describing a soil over larger extents due to the significant variation in the 
nature of a soil over small distances. Despite this, it is useful to provide descriptions of 
soil for a larger volume that predict expected values for a property in that space. These 
are presented as profiles and given names like ‘soil class profiles’ or ‘derived profiles’. 
Soil map units can represent the occurrence of one or more of these interpreted profiles. 

Creating separate classes to describe a soil based on the process (observation or 
interpretation) used to generate the description and the extent of the sampling is 
problematic. It can lead to convoluted modeling, where the same sets of properties are 
repeated across the ‘observed’ and ‘derived’ classes. Also, not all soil descriptions are 
profile-based, focusing on recording only a small subset of properties and often ignoring 
the internal structure of the soil. Using a profile to capture these simpler descriptions is 
misleading, overstating the intent of the descriptive activity. Finally, the hybrid sampling 
and description aspect of a profile doesn’t reconcile well with Observations and 
Measurements, which makes a strong distinction between the sampling feature and the 
domain feature against which the observations are made.

Figure 7 —  Soil profile class model. 

	
To align with O&M and simplify modeling, a single SO_Soil class was created that could 
hold descriptions for observed profiles, derived profiles, or simple soil descriptions. 
Sampling data are captured by the O&M aligned SamplingFeature classes. These can be 
aggregated into an identifiable profile using a SO_SoilProfile class. If required, different 
sub-classes of SO_SoilProfile could be defined (for example to explicitly model 
INSPIRE Observed and Derived Soil Profiles) with minimal impact on the rest of the 
model. 

9.2.4 Soil Monitoring 

This interoperability experiment tested the applicability of OGC 15-043r3 (the 
Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements) for delivery of time-varying data 
for dynamic soil properties. The conceptual model reflects this (Figure 8) and OGC15-
043r3 fully describes the model. 



OGC 16-088r1 

32 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

Figure 8 — Monitoring data class model 

	
The Timeseries profile extends O&M to provide a cross-domain model for the delivery of 
measurements of environmental phenomena in a time series. Aside from providing 
classes that describe the sensors (ObservationProcess) and the platforms they are 
mounted on (MonitoringFeature), the model defines a TimeseriesObservation whose 
result is a set of time value pairs presented in a time-value-pair or domain-range form. 

9.3 Logical Model 

The logical model is a technology specific document that creates an ISO19109:2005 
compliant UML application schema using the semantics of the Conceptual Model (Figure 
9). The model consists of a single package containing classes created to describe a soil 
and its horizons. Classes that describe sampling and monitoring activities are imported, 



OGC 16-088r1 

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 33 
 

without extension, from O&M (Figure 10) and the Timeseries Profile of O&M (Figure 
11). 

There is a one-to-one relationship between the scope and semantics of the conceptual and 
the logical model classes created to describe the soil domain. As such, definitions are not 
repeated from the Conceptual Model section. 

The only significant change to the conceptual model is the removal of soil sampling 
classes and their replacement with the appropriate O&M super-class (Table 3).  

The Logical Model also makes references to Concept and ConceptScheme classes 
defined by the W3C Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) for controlled 
vocabularies of terms (all properties with the data type ScopedName) and soil 
classification (SO_SoilTaxonomy, SO_SoilTaxon and SO_HorizonDesignation).

9.4 Physical Model 

The physical model (Figure 12) defines how soil description features and their properties 
shall be encoded using GML according to the rules specified in ISO19136:2007. The 
resulting schema has been provisionally titled SoilIEML and the XML schema document 
is published at: 

https://github.com/opengeospatial/SoilDataIE/schema/soil-data-ie.xsd 

The XSD was generated manually from the logical model and matches its semantics 
exactly. 

Table 4 lists the namespaces declared or imported by the schema. 

The SKOS information model for controlled content cannot be incorporated into the 
GML schema. References to SKOS Concepts are implemented as HTTP URIs held in 
XLINK attribute values.

10 Soil Data Interoperability Experiment Architecture 

The Soil Data IE architecture (Figure 13) defines the components used to implement a 
prototype distributed system that exchanged data according to the Soil Data IE 
information model. Three suites of components were deployed. 

— Web services conforming to OGC specifications (WFS, WCS, WPS and SOS) for the 
delivery and processing of site registration, and soil formation, description, sampling, 
observation data. 

— Web services conforming to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Linked Data 
Platform for the resolution feature URIs and the delivery of soil classification and 
vocabulary definitions. 

— Bespoke tools to present or transform data. 

The design is a service oriented architecture where components support the discovery of 
features and the construction of representations of the features. Complimenting this is a 
lightweight resource oriented architecture where features are given URIs to uniquely 
identify them and provide access to digital representations. This allowed the 
configuration of features as relatively lightweight objects that used URI links to identify 
and resolve to related features. The client can access related data as it needs, rather than 
deal with a single large object with all related data returned inline. It also allowed the use 
of SKOS to provide data for terms and their definitions. This was useful but introduces an 
inconsistency into the system, as the nature of the data encoding patterns and protocols 
being used changed to those of the Semantic Web.

10.1 Components 

10.1.1 OGC Web Services 

Four OGC-compliant service interfaces were used to deliver the soil data of interest: 
Sensor Observation Service (SOS); Web Coverage Service (WCS); Web Feature Service 
(WFS); and Web Processing Service (WPS). The Use Case 1 WFS instances were new 
and were bound directly to the databases managed by participants. In contrast, the SOS 
instances used for Use Case 2 were ‘virtual services’ that used a simple XSLT-based 
mediator to translate data from existing SOS instances into TimeseriesML.  The 
experiment was able to make use of existing WCS instances that were providing the soil 
property predictions covered by Use Case 3. Results from WFS queries were forwarded 
to WPS to generate additional soil properties. 

Sensor Observation Service (SOS) 
Version 1.0 [06-009r6] and 2.0 [OGC 12-006]. 
Implementation ncSOS-THREDDS Server (USGS); 

Hilltop Server SOS (Horizons Regional Council; Landcare Research) 
Use Case 2 
Role Provision dynamic soil property (soil moisture and temperature) observations. 
Comments SOS instances provided by participants conformed to different versions and provided 

different content (O&M 1.0, THREDDS, and WaterML 2.0, Hilltop). They were 
therefore proxied by a bespoke mediator service (see XSLT Mediator below) that 
translated their responses into TimeseriesML 1.0.

Use Case 4 
Role Provision of processes encapsulating pedo-transfer functions to calculate soil wilting 

point, field capacity and bulk density for soil horizon data provided by Use Case 1 
WFS instances. 

 

10.1.2 Linked Data Services 

Every identifiable feature, classifier and term used by the IE was given an HTTP URI as 
an identifier and means of linking data from different data types or sources. A very 
simple interpretation of the Linked Data Platform principles was used to design these 
URIs and the Linked Data web services were used to dereference them (PID Service) and 
also provide definitions of properties and terms (Linked Data Registry).  

Persistent Identifier Service (PID Service) 
Version 1.1.137 [Auscope PID] 
Implementation AuScope SISS PIDService (Landcare Research) 

Use Cases 1, 2 
Role Manages the resolution of URIs identifying GML Features (soil and sampling data) 

and SKOS Concepts (term and property definitions). It uses REGEX to parse the URI 
and map it onto a request to an appropriate service, redirecting it to a WFS 
GetFeature request or an item in the Linked Data Registry. 



OGC 16-088r1

Implementation Epimorphics Linked Data Registry (Core) (CSIRO) 

Use Cases 1, 2 
Role Manages the SKOS Concepts used to capture definition of terms and property types 

used by the experiment. 
 

10.1.3 Bespoke Services and Applications 

Several bespoke applications were written to demonstrate the implementation of the IE 
services; this includes a mediator servlet that used XSLT to create appropriate GML 
when source services could not. The details of demonstration client applications are 
included in subsequent sections. 

XSLT Mediator 
Version 1.0 
Implementation Bespoke java servlet (Landcare Research) 

Use Cases 2 
Role A proxy service used to translate O&M 1.0 and WaterML 2.0 from participating 

sensor services into TimeseriesML 1.0. 
 

11 Soil Data Interoperability Experiment Demonstration 

11.1 Demonstration 1 – Use cases 1 and 4 

This demonstration deployed clients and services that implemented both Use Case 1 (Soil 
Data Integration) and, because the necessary data processing used data provided for Use 
Case 1, Use Case 4 (Pedo-transfer Functions). Table 5 summarizes the participants and 
their contribution and Figure 14 shows the components of the IE architecture that were 
used. 

Participants deployed: 

— Web Feature Services that provided soil description and sampling and lab analysis 
data for soil sites; 

— a Web Processing Service that took soil horizon descriptions (served by WFS) and 
generated predictions of soil wilting point, field capacity and bulk density for each 
horizon; and 

— a Register of soil vocabularies and property definitions. 



OGC 16-088r1 

42 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

A Persistent Identifier Service managed the resolution of the HTTP URIs allocated to the 
resources (GML Features and SKOS Concepts) provided by these services. 

Two clients were created to demonstrate the use case. An overview of the user 
interaction, and the services and feature types used to facilitate this, is included in Annex 
D. 

Landcare Research deployed a simple client to demonstrate how linked data principles 
could be used to access and explore representations of soil description and sampling data 
at a site (Figure 15). It also included links into the soil definition register to show how a 
client could be augmented with definitions of terms through calls to SKOS Concepts. 

Federation University Australia deployed a more comprehensive client to integrate the 
complete set of Use Case 1 soil description and observation data from CSIRO, ISRIC and 
Landcare Research (Figure 16). The application allowed the user to explore the data and 
provided visualizations of soil particle size distribution data. It also incorporated pedo-
transfer functions published by a WPS at ISRIC, allowing the user, at the press of a 
button, to augment the local data with predictions of soil wilting point, field capacity and 
bulk density. 

These clients were used to demonstrate Use Cases 1 and 2 at the OGC Technical 
Committee meeting at Sydney in December, 2015. A video of the demonstration is 
available via the OGC YouTube channel:

11.2 Demonstration 2 – Use case 2 

This demonstration deployed a client and services that implemented Use Case 2 (Soil 
Sensor Data). Table 6 summarizes the participants and their contribution and Figure 17 
shows the components of the Soil IE architecture that were used. 

Participants deployed: 

— existing Sensor Observation Services that provided soil moisture monitoring data; 

— an XSLT Mediator service to transform the SOS service data into TimeseriesML; and 

— a Register of soil property definitions. 

As with Demonstration 1, a Persistent Identifier Service was used to manage resource 
URIs. 

Landcare Research deployed a simple client to plot the temporal variation in soil 
moisture state and rainfall (Figure 18). An overview of user interaction, and the services 
and feature types used to facilitate this, is included in Annex D.3. Data were provided by 
Horizons Regional Council (catchment soil hydrology monitoring services), Landcare 
Research (precision irrigation monitoring at a research farm) and the USGS (region flood 
hazard monitoring). 

As it was not a formal standard at the time of the IE, no TimeseriesML SOS services 
were available for testing. Instead, each participant made available SOS endpoints 
conforming to SOS 1.0 (O&M 1.0) or SOS 2.0 (WaterML 2.0) and a mediator service 
was deployed to broker access to the services and transform their responses into 
TimeseriesML.

11.3 Demonstration 3 – Use case 3 

This demonstration used an existing Web Coverage Service to implement Use Case 3 
(Soil Property Modeling and Predictions). Table 7 summarizes the participants and their 
contribution. 

As part of the consortium of researchers working on the Soil and Landscape Grid of 
Australia (http://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid), CSIRO has deployed a 
Web Coverage Service that includes coverages predicting the national variation of a set 
of soil properties. Meanwhile ISRIC has deployed a Web Coverage service predicting the 
global distribution of an equivalent set of properties. In both cases, the predictions were 
consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap project and therefore covered soil 
properties that had been prioritized for the Soil IE. Table 8 summarizes the coverages 
provided and the Soil Data IE UML properties to which they correspond. 

The soil properties are derived properties in that they are conditional on other properties. 
For example, the clay prediction in the soParticleSizeDistribution value where the 
soParticleSize is <2µm and the SO_Component describes the fine earth fraction. 
Depending on the particle size classification scheme used by the data provider, the source 
data may be processed to match these criteria for the predictions. 

With the exception of ‘Depth of Soil’, coverages of predictions were provided for six 
depth intervals (0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm) for each 
Soil Property. In turn, each prediction is accompanied by two coverages representing the 
lower 5% and upper 95% confidence intervals for the prediction. 

The coverages can be viewed as layers in the Federation University Australia client 
deployed for Demonstration 1, or, juxtaposed with site data from SoilIEML WFS, in 
QGIS (Figure 19).

12 Results 

This Soil IE successfully met the stated objectives. It developed a core soil information 
model, implemented standardized services against the model from a number of different 
sources, demonstrated the ability to satisfy the defined use cases, and delivered this IE 
engineering report and a set of recommendations to further progress this work. 

12.1 Information modeling 

The following were discovered during the modeling process. 

1. Soil is a complex entity and therefore is often difficult and time consuming to 
conceptualize. This is reflected in the existing candidate models: they are either 
relatively simple, and defer a lot of the work to implementers, or extensive, but 
complex and difficult to comprehend. Both approaches have their limitations. 

2. Simple models rely on extension through soft-typing and risk proliferation of 
extensions that may not interoperate. 

3. Explicit, complex models can be difficult to implement and result in complex and 
cumbersome physical implementations.

4. When defining a soil data exchange standard, we need to strive for a continuum from 
the conceptual to physical models where simplicity and complexity are used 
carefully, but not uniformly. For example, by defining an explicit conceptual model 
to guide and constrain implementations but using a more flexible physical encoding 
utilizing soft/virtual typing. Regardless, the models need to be defined in modules and 
developed in increments. Also, for a given application, not every aspect of a soil may 
be described, instead the end user will compile a view of the soil using only those 
modules that are needed. 

5. The new model developed in the IE is simple, but robust, defining a soil as per the 
profile model (a collection of horizons) but reconciling it with the existing OGC 
standards baseline by decoupling the profile as a combined soil and soil sampling 
artefact. However, while the current model for soil composition (SO_Component) 
works well for a description of soil properties according to the GlobalSoilMap 
project, it is unlikely to be extensible. A more robust means of describing the material 
composition of the soil, and the interaction of those components should be defined. 

6. The use of OM_Observation as a datatype was very useful for annotating property 
values with useful provenance and quality metadata, but expensive in terms of 
volume of XML generated; not all OM_Observation properties are needed in this 
context. An ability to switch between a terse view of an observation (when inline) and 
a comprehensive view, when provided as a feature would be valuable. 

12.2 Implementation 

The following were discovered during implementation. 

1. The IE did not have sufficient resources to develop the model further, especially with 
the limited time for face-to-face meetings and development work. 

2. Most participants were inexperienced information modelers and this further hampered 
the modeling exercise. Future agreement on a standard soil data model will require 
increased access to experienced information modelers with capacity to mentor other 
participants and soil domain specialists. 

3. The use of Linked Data principles for identification and linking of features was 
helpful, simplifying much of the interaction with services on RESTful lines; these 
were easily implemented using the PID service. 

4. Participants reported difficulty deploying services. Although the physical model is 
relatively simple, implementation was complicated by: 

a. Limited experience with web service applications and object relational 
mapping techniques; 

b. The complexity of mapping from the source database tables to the target 
schema; and 



OGC 16-088r1

c. The reliability of the application used to provide the service. 

5. Simple desktop clients for ‘quick and dirty’ testing of services are rare. WFS 2.0 and 
GML Simple Features Level 1 application schema support in GIS tools is poor. When 
restructuring the data to provide layer driven GML/GeoJSON formation information 
can be lost or compromised. 

6. TimeseriesML can be used to deliver soil moisture and rainfall data and WaterML 2.0 
can be translated to TimeseriesML 1.0 with minimal effort. 

7. As a result of the IE we believe GML is missing some useful core datatypes: 

a. A Measure and Reference range data type (also a known requirement for 
geology and groundwater data) to consistently provide interval values; we 
expect most schema that work with interpreted/aggregated data would benefit 
from such a type; and 

b. A register of sampling feature types building on the informative O&M 
common sampling features [ISO 19156:2011, clause 10.4] would be useful; 
this should be a cross domain vocabulary as features like plots are not unique 
to soil, e.g. ecology. 

8. There were conceptual difficulties implementing O&M observations. The 
‘featureOfInterest’ as used in the O&M Abstract Specification is inconsistently 
applied in implementations, representing either the immediate sampling feature or the 
ultimate domain specific sampled feature. 

9. The use of SKOS for data definitions is well established but they are not well 
integrated into the OGC suite of standards. Moving from GML to RDF/XML and 
OWS to SPARQL when working with vocabulary data is an irritant for software 
engineers. It would also be useful to filter across the GML/SKOS disconnect, for 
example a filter to find all features classified with a Concept that also discovers those 
classified with its narrower (transitive) concepts. Finally, there are inconsistencies 
between RDF implementations, for example comparing RDF from SISSVoc services 
and the Linked Data Registry, each uses properties from different namespaces for the 
same purpose. At the very least an OGC profile for SKOS/RDF should be defined.  

10. The ability to use coverages to provide predictions of the variation in soil properties 
in space was expected and proven. In a useful distributed soil information system, 
data from soil observation and description services would be used to generate and test 
predictions. Further testing is required to investigate and demonstrate the utility of the 
IE services in this context.

12.3 Conclusions 

This Interoperability Experiment has shown that the problem of soil data interoperability 
can be addressed and the definition of solutions has already been well advanced by 
existing initiatives. Overall, the information model defined by the Soil IE: 

 Matches the conceptual needs of the GlobalSoilMap specification; 
 Exceeds the coverage of the ISO SoilML, IS0/IUSS and eSoTerML schema; 
 Is broadly equivalent to the INSPIRE Soil model; 
 Falls well short of the ANZSoilML model; and 
 Requires reworking to better allow class and property extensions. 

Future work will need to reconcile the need for a comprehensive and unambiguous 
conceptual model and a flexible, lightweight implementation model. 

Meanwhile, current technology allows the deployment of web services to support soil 
data exchange. The main impediment to progress is the absence of a standards 
community that is well enough resourced and mentored to develop the necessary 
technical and modeling skills required to develop a model and systems that describe a 
complex and nuanced natural resource. A resource that we must describe and understand 
in as much detail as possible to ensure we can support the Earth’s human population and 
biosphere well into the future. 

13 Recommendations 

We make the following recommendations for related OGC standards: 

1. Create feature or data type to support attributed property values, either by defining an 
XML implementation of OM_Observation where all properties except result are 
optional, or a new datatype that uses OM_Observation as the pattern for structure. 

2. Add a MeasureRangeType to GML Basic Types. 

3. Develop best practices for the use of SKOS in OGC services, perhaps including a 
GML encoding of SKOS (consistent with ISO 19150-2:2015, clauses 6.2.7 and 6.7.2 
[6]) with a view to defining SKOS operators in the Filter Encoding Specification.  

4. Change the O&M abstract specification to add ‘samplingStrategy’ to O&M 
Observation and restrict ‘featureOfInterest’ for the feature with the observed property 
(as per [9], Table 13). 

14 Future work 

We make the following recommendations for future work.

1. The OGC establishes a Standards Working Group to undertake the modular 
development of a set of abstract and implementation models for soil data in 
coordination with activities of the IUSS WGSIS and the FAO Global Soil 
Partnership (Pillars 5 and 4). 

2. An initial task of the SWG would be to review the recommendations of this report 
and initiate change requests, or other activities, where appropriate. 

3. Initiate a Soil Coverage Interoperability Experiment to test the integration of soil 
description, observation, monitoring data (plus other environmental covariates) for 
the development of soil property predictions to support farm and environmental 
management activities.

Use Cases 

A.1  Use Case 1 — Soil Data Integration 

Participants CSIRO (AU), Federation University (AU), ISRIC (NL), Landcare Research (NZ) 

Synopsis This use case involves using the soil schema as a canonical structure into which 
heterogeneous soil data (for sites, laboratory results and historical reports) formats 
are transformed and published. The focus is on data generated by an observation, 
or similar process, at a given location. For data that describe interpreted or 
modelled data see Use Case 3. 

Scope Site registration; soil sampling, observation, classification and mapping; 
vocabularies. 

Benefits/Value This use case provides a basic mechanism for exchange of soil data which has been 
captured for a variety of purposes and is managed in many disparate data systems. 
Publication of standardized data services will greatly benefit soil research, analysis 
and reporting mechanisms at individual, local, national and international levels. 

Objective The objective of this use case is to have a number of different soil data 
management organizations delivering a set of agreed soil data services compliant 
to an agreed data model. Many applications could then be conceived to access and 
utilize this standardized data for a variety of purposes, such as those above. This 
would also facilitate: 

— Serving soil data so it can be used for commercial purposes such as to inform 
farming decisions; and 

— Serving soil data so it can be used to determine temporal trends in soil health 
for farm and environmental management and reporting.

A.2  Use Case 2 — Soil Sensor Data 

Participants Horizons Regional Council (NZ), Landcare Research (NZ), USGS (US) 

Synopsis This use-case involves identifying the location of soil monitoring sensors and 
accessing dynamic soil properties at these sensor locations as well as related 
observations from these sensors to inform farmers, scientists, managers, and the 
public about local soil conditions. The test case is the provision of soil moisture 
data. 

Scope Site registration; soil monitoring. 

Benefits/Value Soil moisture timeseries data is of particular interest to drought coordinators for 
predicting and evaluating drought conditions, to flood forecasters to improve base 
conditions used for modeling flood conditions, emergency managers for 
controlling wildfires, and farmers to manage crop and pasture irrigation. 

Objective — Serve in-situ soil moisture timeseries data in concert with soil sensor metadata 
and soil parameters. 

— Serving data aggregated as part of a national monitoring network of in-situ 
sensors (e.g. soil moisture monitoring network).  

— To deliver a temporal feed of actual soil moisture data using of in-situ, site 
probe based data through related services.  

Actors Human: 
— drought modelers 
— emergency managers 
— water resource managers 
— flood forecasters 
— farmers 

Machine: 
— portals 
— web services 
— modeling software 

Actions An actor discovers soil sensors and accesses soil properties at the locations of those 
sensors: 

— at one or more depths/depth intervals beneath the surface; or 
— as a continuous vertical function for a soil profile or pedon.  

An actor accesses related timeseries observations at sensors

A.3  Use Case 3 — Soil Property Modeling and Predictions 

Participants CSIRO (AU), ISRIC (NL) 

Synopsis Provision high resolution estimates of functional soil properties across the globe. 
These estimates will be provided as coverages describing variation in a property 
over a horizontal extent (either at the earth's surface or subsurface intervals) or 
vertically (for example continuous variation within a soil profile). An example 
application is the provision of the data products generated by participants in the 
GlobalSoilMap project (a global map of regularly distributed soil property 
predictions over six depth intervals). 

Scope Soil description, classification and mapping. 

Benefits/Value Supports the development and implementation of policies for the management of 
the soil resources and to respond to natural resource emergencies (e.g. floods, 
droughts, wildfires). 

Objective Serving soil data: 
— so it can be used for commercial purposes such as to inform farming decisions; 
— for integration into farm management software, then delivering outputs for 

monitoring purposes e.g. phosphorus, management for maximum yields, 
subsequent impact; 

— for environmental monitoring (e.g. drought monitoring), soil moisture 
coverage would fit this; 

— aggregated as part of a national monitoring network of in situ sensors (e.g. soil 
moisture network); or 

— describing vertical variation in soil properties (e.g. profile slices for pH, EC 
and organic carbon).

A.4  Use Case 4 — Pedo-transfer Functions 

Participants ISRIC (NL) 

Synopsis Soil pedo-transfer functions (PTF) are predicted functions of certain soil properties 
using data from soil surveys and normally used for the purpose of translating 
between soil properties, attributes and/or agronomic values. The use case will 
focus on running specific functions on soil data obtaining values that were not 
measured in the field, new agronomical significant values, soil classification 
parameters. 

Scope Soil description, classification. 

Benefits/Value Most soil data is collected for a specific purpose and while some has detailed 
analytical results, often only a few properties of interest are analyzed in 
laboratories. Pedo-transfer functions allow development of mathematical 
relationships between values of different properties, such that the properties of 
interest can be estimated from the results of those analyses that are available. 

Objective — Data conversion / harmonization  

— New derived soil attributes from field measured

Soil Information Models 

B.1   Australia and New Zealand Soil Mark-up Language (ANZSoilML) 

 

Agencies CSIRO (Australia); Landcare Research (New Zealand) 
Synopsis ANZSoilML was originally developed in Australia (as OzSoilML) to capture 

soil descriptions created according to the Australian Soil and Land Survey Field 
Handbook. It was intended to support the exchange of soil description and 
laboratory data between Australian state and federal government agencies. The 
design of the model made reference to the SoTerML, INSPIRE Soil and ISO 
SoilML models. 
It became ANZSoilML when it was adopted in NZ, both for data exchange and 
also as the conceptual model for the NZ National Soil Data Repository. 
This work included the extension of the model to define a profile of 
Observations and Measurements to support the GlobalSoilMap.net consortium’s 
metadata requirements for the individual cells in its global grid of soil property 
predictions. 
It is currently at version 2.0.1

GmbH (Germany); INRA (France); University of Nottingham (UK); Czech 
University of Lfe Sciences (Czech Republic); Chinese Academy of Sciences 
(China); INRA-Maroc (Morocco); Wageningen University (Netherlands) 

Synopsis “The e-SOTER project aims at providing web services for soil and terrain data 
based on […] quantitative mapping of landforms; soil parent material and soil 
attribute characterisation using pattern recognition on remote sensing data; and 
standardisation of methods and measures of soil attributes to convert legacy data.” 
“The design of SoTerML had to take into account two competing aspects. The first 
is the various soil attribute data profiles or classifications already used in SOTER 
databases. The three main data designs are: the SOTER profile (Oldeman and van 
Engelen, 1993) [9], WRB (2006) (World Reference Base of Soil Resources) (WRB, 
2006) [8] and the FAO classification schemas (FAO, 1988) [2]. The second aspect is 
related to the interoperability developments led by OGC (Open Geospatial 
Consortium) concerning geographical datasets. On the one hand the goal is to be 
able to facilitate understanding and transfer from existing formats and data models, 
whilst on the other the aim is to provide exchange of datasets necessitating 
harmonisation and standardisation with compliancy to existing standards.” 
“The approach in designing SoTerML data attributes was to incorporate as much 
flexibility and reuse as possible. Different elements in the class hierarchy of 
SoTerML require attributes to be associated with them without restricting their 
numbers or their data types or specificities.”

theme covers:  

a) Soil inventories, providing one-off assessments of soil conditions and/or 
soil properties at certain locations and at a specific point in time, and allow 
soil monitoring, providing a series of assessments showing how soil

1 Home, map of  soil sampling sites WFS sams:SF_SpatialSamplingFeature 

UC1 Implemented using a bounding box (based on the map extent) filtered WFS GetFeature request. 

GML Features are converted to GeoJSON objects before being drawn as markers. 

2 Click on a site to view the individual 
samples taken at this location. 

Choice (for each specimen) : click on link 
to view the sampled soil horizon (step 3) 
or the observations made against the 
specimen (step 4)
