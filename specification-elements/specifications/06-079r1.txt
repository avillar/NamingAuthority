Introduction  

This specification is part of a set that describe services for managing Earth Observation (EO) 
data products. The services include collection level, and product level catalogues, online-
ordering for existing and future products, on-line access etc. These services are put into 
context in an overall document [NR3- Best Practices for EO Products]. 

The services proposed in this profile are intended to support the identification (EO) data 
products from previously identified data collections. In other words, the search and present of 
metadata from catalogues of EO data products. The intent of this profile is to describe a cost 
effective interface that can be supported by many data providers (satellite operators, data 
distributors …), most of whom have existing (and relatively complex) facilities for the 
management of these data. The strategy is to reuse as far as possible the SOAP binding 
defined in the ISO Application Profile [OR1] as csw201.ApIso-soap-binding.wsdl, except the 
schemas defining the information model. To achieve a cost effective interface, some choices 
present in [OR1] will be limited by textual comments.  

EO data product collections are usually structured to describe data products derived from a 
single sensor onboard a satellite or series of satellites. Products from different classes of 
sensors usually require specific product metadata. The following classes of products have 
been identified so far: radar, optical, atmospheric. The proposed approach is to identify a 
common set of elements grouped in a common (HMA) schema and extend this common 
schema to add the sensors specific metadata. 

 

1 Scope 
A profile constrains one or more base specifications to meet the needs of a particular domain.  
ISO 19106 (Profiles) distinguishes two kinds of profiles, depending upon whether the profile 
restricts or extends the  base specifications.  The current document is a profile restricting and 
extending the CSW ISO Application Profile for use by the Earth Observation (EO) 
community. 

This proposed application profile document describes the interfaces, bindings and encodings 
required to discover, search and present metadata from catalogues of Earth Observation 
products. The profile presents a minimum specification for catalogue interoperability within 
the EO domain, with extensions for specific classes of data.

Conformance may be tested via the HMA prototype Acceptance Test Plan [NR4].

Figure 1 UML notations 

In these UML class diagrams, the class boxes with a light background are the primary classes 
being shown in this diagram, often the classes from one UML package. The class boxes with 
a gray background are other classes used by these primary classes, usually classes from other 
packages. 

In this diagram, the following stereotypes of UML classes are used: 
<<Interface>> A definition of a set of operations that is supported by objects having this 

interface. An Interface class cannot contain any attributes. 

<<Type>> A stereotyped class used for specification of a domain of instances (objects), 
together with the operations applicable to the objects. A Type class may have attributes 
and associations. 

<<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent existence and 
the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no operations whose primary 
purpose is to hold the information. 

<<CodeList>> A flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of potential 
values. If the list alternatives are completely known, an enumeration shall be used; if the 
only likely alternatives are known, a code list shall be used. 

<<Enumeration>> A data type whose instances form a list of alternative literal values. 
Enumeration means a short list of well-understood potential values within a class.

In this document, the following standard data types are used: 
CharacterString – A sequence of characters 

Boolean – A value specifying TRUE or FALSE 

Integer – An integer number 

Identifier – Unique identifier of an object 

URI – An identifier of a resource that provides more information 

URL – An identifier of an on-line resource that can be electronically accessed 

5.3 Document terms and definitions 
This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [NR2]. 

6 System context 
This section focuses on the purpose, scope and policies of catalogue services that comply with 
the given profile. It documents special requirements and describes the context of use. 

6.1 Application domain 
The catalogue services proposed in this profile are intended to support the retrieval of EO 
products metadata possibly in two steps.  

Step 1: identification of collections of interest through a catalogue of collections metadata. 

Step 2: identification of EO products of interest within one or several collections though a 
catalogue of EO products metadata. 

This profile covers step 2. It For the retrieval of EO products metadata, the defined interface 
should allow to implement both generic clients not aware of sensor specific metadata and 
more specialized clients aware of sensors specific metadata.  

 

6.2 Essential use cases 
The use cases for this profile are the CSW ISO Application Profile use cases applied to Earth 
Observation. See [OR1]. More detailed use cases can be found in [OR2].

7 Information models 
The scope of the information managed within this profile is the core metadata that are 
required to distinguish and identify EO Products. There are two levels of metadata that are 
traditionally identified for EO Products: collection level (i.e. “dataset collection”) and product 
(i.e. “dataset”) level. Collection level metadata are well managed by the existing ISO profile 
[OR1]. Product metadata are less well managed, for two reasons: redundancy and lack of key 
attributes. 

This CSW information model supports the description of the following information resources: 

Information resource Description 

Earth Observation Product Mapped to “dataset” in OGC Terminology. Set of metadata 
that describe an EO Product.

7.1 EO Products Metadata Information Model 

The following picture describes the layered structure of the schemas used to define the 
different classes of product metadata. The layer structure  means that the upper layer main 
element type is defined by extending a type from the lower level schema.  

Issue 1: The reuse of gmd elements has still to be clarified.

The core queryables mapping to the EO Products information model is defined in the 
following table. 

The OGC core queryables supported by the EO catalogue shall be returned in the “supported-
corequeryables” section of the <ServiceProperties> part in the capabilities document.   

7.2.1 OGC core queryable properties 

As catalogues compliant with this profile may also support csw:IsoRecord as output schema, 
the tables in the following subsections, describe the mapping from [NR0] to both the HMA 
information model and the ISO information model. In the following subsections, the 
“EarthObservationProduct” root element has been removed in the mapping to the HMA 
information model. 

7.2 Mappings to the common XML Record format 

The element that describes the EO metadata is the “EarthObservationProduct” element which 
is defined in the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), OHR (Optical High Resolution), ATM 
(Atmospheric) specific schemas as an extension of a common EarthObservationProduct 
element defined in the HMA schema. This model also called the “HMA information model” 
further in this document is refined in chapter 9 according to the different presentations.

7.2.3 OGC ISO AP queryable properties 

The support for ISO AP queryables as defined in [OR1] is optional for EO catalogues. 

The ISO AP queryables supported by the EO catalogue shall be returned in the “supported-
isoqueryables” section of the <ServiceProperties> part in the capabilities document.   

7.2.4 Additional queryable properties for EO Products 

In addition to the core queryables, this profile defines the following queryable properties4, 
which an implementation of this profile must minimally support.5 The catalogue should 
deliver these queryable properties in its capabilities document. The following should be 
noted: If a catalogue entry holds a null-value for queryable X, this entry does not fulfill any 
query constraint on that queryable except “is Null”. 

If search properties are applied on an information resource which does not support this search 
property, the catalogue throws an exception (see section 8.2.3).  

Additional Search properties or “queryables” will be defined for the different schema layers 
(see Figure 3) defined by this profile. 

7.2.4.1 Additional HMA queryable properties 

The following table contains the additional search properties which are common to all HMA 
EO Product resources.

7.3 Supported data bindings 
The only data binding required to be supported is XML. Any information object that is to be 
managed by a catalogue service complying with this profile must apply this presentation 
form. The encoding of any information object in this profile is based on schemas provided in 
chapter 9.  

7.4 Result sets 
This section defines XML Schema presentations for valid result sets of the application profile. 
A representation of catalogue entries in a result set may substitute for the element 
csw:AbstractRecord defined in the record.xsd schema of the CSW 2.0.0 (with Corrigendum) 
base specification.

Schema\resultset Missions BRIEF SUMMARY FULL

EarthObservationProduct OHR Not Supported Supported Supported 

EarthObservationProduct SAR Not Supported Supported Supported 

 

The relationship between representations and schemas is further discussed in chapter 9. 

7.4.1 SUMMARY Resultset  

A response to a valid catalogue service request with ElementSetName=SUMMARY. This 
element set corresponds to the 'summary' element set in the general catalogue model. The 
corresponding XML schema is defined in chapter 9. 

7.4.2 FULL Resultset 

A response to a valid catalogue service request with ElementSetName=FULL. The 
corresponding XML schema is defined in chapter 9. 

7.5 Service information model 
This section describes the content model and syntax for service metadata of a catalogue 
service compliant with the profile. This model is described according to [NR2]. A compliant 
catalogue service shall describe its capabilities document according to the terms defined by 
OGC 05-008c1 [NR2].

Date: June 06, 2006  EO Application Profile for CSW 2.0 

As the CSW server implements the filter predicate language as defined in [NR1], it must 
include a Filter_Capabilities section in the service metadata to describe which elements of the 
predicate language are supported [OGC 04-021r3] (see 8.3). 

The schema for the Capabilities file for this EO Application Profile is identical to the one 
proposed for the ISO AP (after integration of the comments received during the RFC period).  
This schema allows to include information about supported queryables and output schemas as 
in the example in section 10.1. 

Because every CSW server must implement the filter predicate language as defined in [OGC 
04-095], the server must include a Filter_Capabilities section in the service metadata to 
describe which elements of the predicate language are supported [OGC 04-021r3]. 

The document element must be valid against the following element declaration: 

http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/csw-iso/1.0.0/isoap-capabilities.xsd#Capabilities 

One additional service metadata element is introduced in this profile (Table 17)6 which is also 
used in the ISO AP [OR1] . 

Table 10 – Additional service metadata elements 

Qualified name Content 

ServiceProperties A list of general service properties (see below). 

Each service property is a list of values specified as follows:

  <isoap:value>my-value-1</isoap:value> 

<isoap:value>my-value-2</isoap:value> 

</isoap:property> 

</isoap:ServiceProperties> 

Table 11 lists the general CSW-ISO service properties from [OR1] supported by this EO 
Application Profile. The asterisk (*) denotes the prefix 
“http://www.opengis.net/cat/isoap/properties/”, which is omitted for convenience.

A standard set of service features and properties are used to convey service capabilities that 
are specific to CSW-EO catalogues. The additional property names defined in this profile are 
listed in the table below. If the property name is missing, then the list of associated values is 
assumed to be empty.  An unimplemented feature shall not be listed in the capabilities

7.6 Compatibility with catalogs based on other CSW 2.0 profiles 
The EO Application Profile may optionally support ISO19115/ISO19119 Application Profile 
as output schema (see Table 16).  

In addition, the catalogue should indicate in its capabilities file which ISO AP queryables it 
supports.  The support for these queryables is optional in this profile as indicated in section 
7.2.3. 

Issue : [FS11] Since most of the ISO profile queryables are not supported, see table 1, what 
will be the benefit of supporting the ISO Application Profile? 

7.7 Native language support

8 External interfaces 
This view describes the externally visible behaviour of the system, including the interfaces 
provided by its components and the supported protocol bindings. It defines the request and 
response message structures as part of the operation signatures, primarily the differences to 
that of the OGC CS 2.0.0 (with Corrigendum) base specification. It also documents supported 
query facilities and some implementation guidance.  

8.1 Imported protocol binding (Relationship to the common model) 
This profile inherits the HTTP/SOAP protocol binding from the CSW OGC CS 2.0.0 (with 
Corrigendum) specification. 

Table 13 shows how the operations of this EO Application Profile are mapped to the 
operations specified by the CSW 2.0.0 (with Corrigendum) specification. This is not a full 
mapping in that not all of the CSW(T) ISO operations have a corresponding CSW operation.

All operations must support the embedding of requests and responses in SOAP messages. 
Only SOAP messaging (via HTTP/POST) with document/literal style shall be used. Messages 
shall conform to SOAP 1.2 (http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/). The message payload shall be in 
the body of the SOAP envelope.

8.2 Interface specifications 
This chapter describes syntax and semantics restrictions and variations of the interface 
operations in comparison to those of the imported CSW 2.0.0 (with Corrigendum) HTTP 
protocol binding7. It gives formal, language-independent interface specifications (W3C 
WSDL) that admit multiple programming language bindings and shows error conditions that 
can occur. 

8.2.1 OGC_Service Interface 

8.2.1.1 GetCapabilities Operation  

The GetCapabilities operation allows clients to retrieve service metadata from a server. The 
response to a GetCapabilities request should be an XML document containing service 
metadata about the server (see [NR2] and [NR0]). 

The sections parameter may be used to request a subset of the complete capabilities 
document; the value is a comma-separated list of section names. The allowed set of section 
names recognized by this profile are listed in Table 9. If this parameter is absent, the complete 
description must be returned; unrecognized section names are ignored. 

Table 9 — Permissible section names  

Section name Content 

ServiceIdentification General information about the service (type, version, etc.). 

ServiceProvider Information about the organization providing the service. 

OperationsMetadata Summarizes the operational characteristics of the service.

10 It is not reasonable to request all records from an EO Products catalogue. 

48 



Date: June 06, 200

49 

Issue 12: We suppose a single catalogue may store heterogeneous collections, i.e. optical or radar collections, and thus return information according to 
different schemas: ohr.xsd, sar.xsd etc.  This means that DescribeRecord should have a collection ID as parameter ?  Alternatively, the various schemas 
should be merged into a single one or a main one which contains an ohr part, sar part, atm part etc. 

Issue 11: the search response should include the collection ID to which each search result belongs.  In EOLI-XML, this was not needed as a client could only 
query for one collection at a time and thus know to which collection a product belonged.  With Filter language encoding, the filter can search inside multiple 
collections at a time and the client may not be able to find out to which collection belongs each record.  The ISO “ParentIdentifier” could be used to include 
the Collection ID of the product.

8.2.2.1.2 Response 

8.2.2.1.2.1 XML encoding 

The following XML-Schema fragment defines the XML format response to a GetRecords 
operation: 

Source is the schemas delivered with [OR1]. Some definitions are discussed below. 

 

 

50 



Date: June 06, 2006  EO Application Profile for CSW 2.0 

 
This operation must respond with an XML document including the results. If the resultType 
parameter is set to “results”, the catalogue service must include any matching records within 
the <SearchResults> element, up to the maximum number of records specified in the request. 
The <SearchResults> element is a generic XML container. This generic container is defined 
in the CSW 2.0.0 (with Corrigendum) specification. The content of the <SearchResults> 
element is the set of records returned by the GetRecords operation. The following XML 
schema fragment defines the SearchResultsType: 

 
<xsd:complexType name="SearchResultsType" id="SearchResultsType"> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:choice> 
    <xsd:element ref="csw:AbstractRecord" minOccurs="0"

</xsd:complexType> 

Catalogue services implementing this Application Profile MUST NOT substitute 
<csw:AbstractRecord> but rather <xs:any> with XML documents that comply with one 
of the schemas defined in chapter 9.  

On top of that, the following limitations apply:  

o The parameter “resultSetId” is optional,  

o The Parameter “expires” is not supported in the response because of the stateless 
character of the profile. The result sets expires immediately.  

o The value “StatusType.processing” should never be used by the status 
attribute.  

o The optional parameter “timestamp” is already optional in the ISO Application 
Profile and does not seem useful in this profile. 

If the resultType parameter is set to “hits”, the catalogue service shall return a 
<GetRecordsResponse> element containing an empty <SearchResults> element that 
indicates the estimated size of the result set. Optional attributes may or may not be set 
accordingly. 

 

8.2.2.2 GetRecordById Operation 

The mandatory GetRecordById request retrieves the default representation of catalogue 
records using their fileidentifier. The GetRecordById operation is an implementation of the 
Present operation from the general model. Normally this operation presumes that a previous 
query has been performed in order to obtain the identifiers that may be used with this 
operation.

8.2.2.2.1.2 Parameter descriptions 

Table 17 specifies the parameters of the GetRecordById operation request (XML). The 
column EO App. Profile shows syntax and/or semantics restrictions or variations in 
comparison to those of the base spec.  

Note that the GetRecordById operation does not allow to include the OUTPUTRECORD 
keyword.  By default, the catalogue should return the most specialised record type.  For 
example, an OHR type catalogue should return the OhrRecord and not the HmaRecord 
(TBC).   If the client needs a different record type, then it should use the GetRecord operation 
with OUTPUTRECORD keyword and the ID specified in the Filter expression.

Issue 13: How can the DAIL know to which catalogue to route the request? In the GetRecords 
interface we have the collectionId implicit in the query, here we have no query parameter. 
Collection Id to be included in the ID to have a unique ID ? 

8.2.2.2.2 Response 

The following XML-Schema fragment defines the GetRecordByIdResponseType as part of 
this XML schema. This is simply the list of requested record: 

 Listing 2 -  GetRecordByIdResponseType definition 

 <xsd:complexType name="GetRecordByIdResponseType" 
id="GetRecordByIdResponseType"> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:choice> 
    <xsd:element ref="csw:AbstractRecord" minOccurs="0"/> 
    <xsd:any namespace="##other" processContents="strict" 
minOccurs="0"/> 
   </xsd:choice> 
  </xsd:sequence> 
 </xsd:complexType> 
 

Catalogues implementing this application profile should return the record in one of the 
schemas defined in chapter 9. In the <xsd:choice> section the option <xsd:any> element 
MUST be used for substitution. 

8.2.2.3 DescribeRecord Operation 

The DescribeRecord operation allows a client to discover elements of the information model 
supported by the target catalogue service. For the response, it should return hma.xsd and the 
specific schema supported by the catalogue (hma, ohr, atm or sar).  

Issue 14: FS1 proposes an updated introduction removing cost notion and satellite words… 

Question: this is to be checked with the ISO Profile which returns the “identification.xsd” 
schema.

8.2.2.3.1 Request 

Table 18 specifies the parameters for the DescribeRecord operation request. The column EO 
App. Profile shows syntax and/or semantics restrictions or variations in comparison to that of 
the base spec. The encoding in the table is directly suitable for the HTTP GET binding. 

The XML encoding of the frame of a valid response is specified in the HTTP binding of the 
CSW 2.0.0 (with Corrigendum) specification. Please refer to this section to determine the 
according XML schema.

Issue 15: In the case of the ISO Application Profile, this will return the data identification 
definition (‘identification.xsd’). In EO Application Profile, the value of “any” would be, 
according to the supported missions, one of the following schemas: hma.xsd, atm.xsd, ohr.xsd 
or sar.xsd. Can we assume that one catalogue implements only one specific schema (atm, 
sar…).  

 

8.2.3 Error handling 

In the event that the submitted request is invalid, an exception report message is generated 
and returned to the client. This report complies with the definition of exception reports that 
are specified by OGC Common specification (see CSW EO Application Profile05-008c1).

The XML encoding of an exception has to comply with owsExceptionReport.xsd that is 
attached to the further mention OGC Common specification. See this document for details. . 

8.3 Query facilities 
OGC Filter Encoding is an XML based encoding of the OGC_Common Query Language. 
This query language (Version 1.1.0) must be supported by all catalogue instances of this 
profile in order to support search interoperability. The capabilities document of the catalogue 
instance shall describe the supported query language (plus version).  

The supported subset of the Filter Encoding shall be returned in the <ogc:Filter_Capabilities> 
section of the capabilities document.  See example in section 10.1. 

Note: The following conditions must be met by the supported query language.

8.4 Implementation guidance  
The following section gives developers help when setting up a catalogue service instance that 
complies with the defined application profile. Any information provided here is non-
normative or is an detailing of former descriptions. 

8.4.1 ISO Application Profile Interface implementation 

The proposed EO Application profile for datasets can be used together with the ISO 
Application Profile for dataset collections to implement an ISO Application Profile CSW 
catalogue using service orchestration as depicted in the UML sequence diagram below.  “f1” 
and “f2” indicate filter language expressions in this picture.

8.4.3 Semantic issues 

o In case of using the appropriate metadata version the contents of 
‘metadataStandardName’ and ‘metadataStandardVersion’ in a metadata set shall 
comply with one of the following conventions: 

o The definition of the resource type in a metadata set should be done in the attribute 
codeListValue of the child element MD_ScopeCode of the element hierarchyLevel. 
Example: 

59 



Date: June 06, 2006  EO Application Profile for CSW 2.0 

<hierarchyLevel> 
<MD_ScopeCode 
codeList="http://someurl.com/codeList.xml#MD_ScopeCode"  

codeListValue="dataset"/> 

 </hierarchyLevel>  

Valid values for hierarchyLevel are15: 
• application 
• dataset 
• datasetcollection 
• service 

o The following values should be used for the parameter outputSchema of a discovery 
operation: 

• csw:HmaRecord, csw:AtmRecord, csw:OhrRecord, csw:SarRecord 
• csw:IsoRecord 

Issue 16: What should be returned by the Catalogue when in a request, the parameter 
“outputschema” is defined as “csw:HmaRecord” ? Should it return a HMA record or if it is a 
more specialised catalogue, the most complete record e.g. a csw:SarRecord ?

9 HMA XML Schemas 

9.1 Impact of Full versus Summary presentation on schema design 
 

At the moment, it is foreseen to define 4 common schemas: HMA, ATM, OHR, SAR that 
define metadata associated to different catalogues. It is also decided to support only two 
presentations: “full” and “summary”. 

The theory is that “summary” results are to allow: 

1. smaller message sizes 

2. “faster” retrieval of product metadata at the server side, allowing the provider to tune 
the performance of his database to provide key metadata quickly 

Looking to some existing catalogue interface definitions, two different approaches are 
discussed on the following sections. 

9.1.1 Single schema shared by different presentations 

The same schema is used for the different presentations, schema uses the optional feature to 
specify information not needed in all presentations and the comments indicate the mandatory 
attributes, elements corresponding to the different presentations.  
+ Single schema definition, leave some freedom to the catalogue implementor 
- Cannot use tools to validate the retrieved records structure according to the presentation. 

The ESA EOLI-XML ICD uses this mechanism to distinguish between the summary, brief 
and full presentations.. 

9.1.2 Multiple schemas according to the different presentations 

Example: ISO19115/ISO19119 AP for CSW 2.0 R3 

Same element (MD_Metadata defined in different namespaces 
http://schemas.opengis.net/iso19115brief , http://schemas.opengis.net/iso19115full, 
http://schemas.opengis.net/iso19115summary  
+ Can  use tools to validate the retrieved records structure according to the presentation.  
- The number of schemas increases, see discussion below.  

If we apply that second approach, Figure 3 in section 7.1 would be split into  

sarFull.xsd ohrFull.xsd atmFull.xsd

hmaFull.xsd

gmd
(ISO - 19139)

gml

sarFull.xsd ohrFull.xsd atmFull.xsd

hmaFull.xsd

Figure 8: EO Dataset Summary Layered Structure 

In more details that would mean that ohrFull:EarthObservationProduct would be defined as an 
extension of hmaFull:EarthObservationProduct. 

We could also imagine that the information of the full presentation as its name seems to 
indicate it, also include all information of the summary information. This would be 
represented as: 

sarFull.xsd ohrFull.xsd atmFull.xsd

ohrSummary.xsd

gmd
(ISO - 19139)

gml

sarSummary.xsd atmSummary.xsd

sarFull.xsd ohrFull.xsd atmFull.xsd

ohrSummary.xsd

gmd
(ISO - 19139)

gml

sarSummary.xsd atmSummary.xsd

 

Figure 9: EO Dataset  Layered Structure By Missions 

If we combine the three pictures taking into account only the HMA and its extension to OHR, 
we get something which has no direct implementation because multi-inheritance is not 
supported in XML schema extension: the ohrFull EarthObservationProduct element can not 
be defined as an extension of both hmaFull EarthObservationProduct element and 
ohrSummary EarthObservationProduct element.

Figure 10: EO Dataset  Multiple-Inheritance Structure 

 

We have to select one of the extension type : extension of presentation or extension of the 
HMA schema.  

Looking at the current OHR schema currently defined, it seems that not alot of information is 
added on top of the HMA schema. So we could conclude, may be prematurally, that the delta 
information which is added on top of HMA does not need to be split between full and 
summary presentations.

9.1.3 Schemas organisation conclusion 

The proposed solution is to not use different schemas for the “full” and the “summary” 
presentations but have the additional “full” parameters as optional elements in the same 
schema.  

9.2 Impact of record types returned on schema design 
Two approaches are possible as explained below.  

Issue 17: impact of record types returned on schema design (see section 9.2.x) 

64 
 



 
 Date: May 31, 2006  EO Application Profile for CSW 2.0 

 

9.2.1 Option 1 : specialisation schemas import hma.xsd 

An optical catalogue may return a different record type than an atmospheric catalogue.  They 
would return a record according to ohr.xsd or atm.xsd respectively.  This poses problems 
when a single catalogue contains heterogeneous collections, e.g. some optical, some 
atmospheric.  In this approach, the 3 schemas ohr, atm and sar import the hma schema and use 
inheritance. The OUTPUTRECORD requested by the client in this case is “HmaRecord”, 
“OhrRecord”, “AtmRecord” or “SarRecord”.  Additional record types can be added without 
impact on the hma.xsd file.  Developers can code client supporting for instance only optical 
catalogues and changes to the atmospheric or radar schemas have no impact on the catalogue 
client.  This is the approach taken in the current document. 

9.2.2 Option 2 : hma.xsd imports all specialisation schemas 

As an alternative, the record structure may always be the same, consisting of a fixed part 
containing the “hma” fields.  In addition, it then would contain either the ohr fields, the 
sar.xsd or the atm fields.  In this solution, a single hma schema would be the umbrella schema 
above the 4 other schemas, hma.xsd, ohr.xsd, atm.xsd, sar.xsd.  This would mean that 
hma.xsd imports the 3 other schemas ohr, atm and sar.  The OUTPUTRECORD requested by 
the client in this case is always “HmaRecord”.  The content will be different according to the 
type of the collection.  Adding an additional record type means that an additional “import” 
clause is to be added in hma.xsd.  Clients requesting the schema will have to be able to 
consume all schemas as they are all linked together via “import” clauses. 

9.3 EO Application Profile schemas 
The different schemas describing the EO products associated to the different missions such as 
optical, radar and atmospheric missions can be found in the “GML Application schema for 
EO products” [NR5].

11 Remaining Issues 
Issue 1: The reuse of gmd elements has still to be clarified. ................................................... 18 

Issue 2: FS6 Why “dc:format” is not supported as returnable properties. Couldn’t it be used to 
describe the format of the product, e.g. GOETIFF or HDF…Same reason as in Core 
Queryable table ?............................................................................................................. 25 

Issue 3: FS7 Can’t we find a use for the “dc:source” field? E.g. for Level 1b product this 
could point to the Level 0 product used to create it......................................................... 25 

Issue 4: Mapping of CRS to GML to be confirmed by GML experts. .................................... 27 

Issue 5: Queryables ending with “Type”. Shouldn’t this reserved for XML Type names and 
not for identifiers ? .......................................................................................................... 29 

Issue 6: [FS11] Since most of the ISO profile queryables are not supported, see table 1, what 
will be the benefit of supporting the ISO Application Profile? ....................................... 33 

Issue 7: [JM11]GetCapabilities operation to be clarified for this profile: e.g. what should be 
the returned sections ? ..................................................................................................... 38 

Issue 8: GetRecords.REQUESTID not supported. What should it mean ? Ignored ? Must not 
be specified ? ................................................................................................................... 42 

Issue 9: [FS15]Non compliance with base spec. if this profile does not support as 
OUTPUTSCHEMA “csw:Record” for the GetRecords operation. ................................. 44 

Issue 10: [FS16]Why SORTBY attribute in getRecord is not “Optional” rather than “Not 
Supported”? ..................................................................................................................... 48 

Issue 11: the search response should include the collection ID to which each search result 
belongs.  In EOLI-XML, this was not needed as a client could only query for one 
collection at a time and thus know to which collection a product belonged.  With Filter 
language encoding, the filter can search inside multiple collections at a time and the 
client may not be able to find out to which collection belongs each record.  The ISO 
“ParentIdentifier” could be used to include the Collection ID of the product................. 49 

Issue 12: We suppose a single catalogue may store heterogeneous collections, i.e. optical or 
radar collections, and thus return information according to different schemas: ohr.xsd, 
sar.xsd etc.  This means that DescribeRecord should have a collection ID as parameter ?  
Alternatively, the various schemas should be merged into a single one or a main one 
which contains an ohr part, sar part, atm part etc. ........................................................... 49 

Issue 13: How can the DAIL know to which catalogue to route the request? In the GetRecords 
interface we have the collectionId implicit in the query, here we have no query 
parameter. Collection Id to be included in the ID to have a unique ID ? ........................ 54 

Issue 14: FS1 proposes an updated introduction removing cost notion and satellite words… 54 

Issue 15: In the case of the ISO Application Profile, this will return the data identification 
definition (‘identification.xsd’). In EO Application Profile, the value of “any” would be, 
according to the supported missions, one of the following schemas: hma.xsd, atm.xsd, 
ohr.xsd or sar.xsd. Can we assume that one catalogue implements only one specific 
schema (atm, sar…)......................................................................................................... 56 

Issue 16: What should be returned by the Catalogue when in a request, the parameter 
“outputschema” is defined as “csw:HmaRecord” ? Should it return a HMA record or if it 
is a more specialised catalogue, the most complete record e.g. a csw:SarRecord ?........ 60
