i. Preface 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of more 

than 375 companies, government agencies, and universities participating in a consensus 

process to develop publicly available geo-processing standards. 

The WMS profile defined in this document began as an initiative funded by the British 

National Space Agency (BNSC) with ongoing support from the European Space Agency 

(ESA).  This Best Practice defines conventions for the Earth Observation (EO) 

community to use OGC Web Services.  The objective of this work is to define how data 

providers can apply OGC Web Service standards in a “standard” way to ensure that the 

inventory level visualisation of EO data is carried out in a truly interoperable way. 

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 05-008], which is based 

on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Rules for the structure and drafting of International 

Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a 

requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

Introduction 

The WMS configuration proposed in this profile is intended to support the interactive 

visualization and evaluation of Earth Observation (EO) data products.  The profile 

describes a consistent Web Map Server (WMS) configuration that can be supported by 

any content providers (satellite operators, data distributors …), most of whom have 

existing (and relatively complex) facilities for the management of these content.  In 

addition, this profile is intended to compliment the EO Products Extension Package for 

ebRIM Profile of CSW 2.0 (OGC 06-131) by showing how WMS servers may be used to 

evaluate products identified through catalogue discovery prior to their ordering.   

 

The target audience for this document includes Web map users, client developers, service 

implementers, and system testers.  This Profile encompasses two interrelated views1 that 

reflect different viewpoints on a Web map service.  Each viewpoint focuses on different 

areas of concern: 

 

 Enterprise – describes the general capabilities of the service in light of functional 
and nonfunctional requirements (for WMS users and system testers); 

 Information – defines the kinds of information handled by the map service and the 

policies to be enforced (for WMS users, developers and testers).

OpenGIS® Web Map Services – 

Application Profile for EO Products 

1 Scope 

This application profile document describes how: 

a) WMS layers, sample dimensions and nested layers can be used to manage the 
hierarchy of EO product information from the collection level, down through 

individual products to the sample and quality bitmask dimensions; 

b) The WMS GetMap operation can be used to support interactive browse and the full 
evaluation of sample coverage and quality information. 

This OGC™ document specifies a constrained, consistent interpretation of the WMS 

standard that is applicable to government, academic and commercial providers of EO 

products.   

2 Conformance 

Conformance with this profile shall be checked using all the relevant abstract tests 

specified in the Abstract Test Suite provided in Annex A of this profile.

6 Overview and Context 

6.1 Background 

The acquisition of EO data is subject to a range of factors which effect the degree to 

which a product is fit for purpose.  For optical EO these factors include cloud cover, 

snow cover, atmospheric aerosols, low illumination angles, sun glint off the ocean or ice 

surface and suspended sediment in the water column.  For imaging radar the usefulness of 

products can be affected by wind speed, presence of surfactants and soil moisture.  It is 

therefore important to potential users that they can evaluate EO products prior to ordering 

and (where applicable) purchase. 

A number of WMS features make them a good choice for EO data providers wanting to 

open up their product inventories for evaluation: 

 Open Web service specifications are widely and simply supported using common 
place Web browsers; 

 Web maps provide a geocoded view of data frequently acquired as ungeocoded 
scan lines; 

 The WMS interface supports roam and zoom functionality not available with a 
simple image thumbnail; 

 Use of high levels of image compression reduces bandwidth requirements relative 
to WCS whilst allowing effective visual inspection; 

 The serving of products via highly compressed images ensures that the original 
data is protected from unauthorised use. 

Unfortunately, practical application of WMS technology is hindered by two issues: 

 

1. Inconsistent interpretation of the WMS standard in the context of EO data; 

2. Server instances are typically configured to return just a single representation 
using a sub-set of the dataset.  Some or even most, of the dataset is not made 

available for evaluation. 

To illustrate the first point, consider the use of WMS „layers‟.  A layer is defined as the 

basic unit of geographic information that may be requested as a map from a server.  A 

literal interpretation would be that each individual EO data granule (dataset) should be 

handled as a WMS layer.  With large inventories of EO products (>10,000) this results in 

bloated responses to GetCapability requests.  An alternative interpretation is that a WMS 

layer should represent a collection of datasets sharing the same product specification (i.e. 

a dataset series).  In this context, individual datasets can be retrieved and presented using 

their acquisition time.   



 

Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 7 
 

 

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Extension OGC 07-063r1 

Whilst both interpretations can be justified, the resulting WMS server configurations are 

incompatible, seriously hindering the client to server and community wide 

interoperability. 

 

6.2 Challenges 

6.2.1 Discovery 

EO data products are usually derived from an instrument onboard a satellite2 containing 

one or more sensors that typically acquire tens of thousands of products during their 

lifetime.  For a user, discovering an appropriate scene via a WMS can be challenging as 

even a well-constrained search may return a number of overlapping scenes which obscure 

each other. 

6.2.2 Evaluation 

Using WMS technology to present EO datasets for evaluation is not straightforward.  

Data are frequently acquired by sensors simultaneously in several wavebands and/or 

polarizations of electromagnetic radiation (see Figure 6-1).  Higher level products may 

also contain coverage of bio/geophysical parameters derived from the original sample 

datasets.  Additional background and quality information are commonly stored as 

bitmasks that are critically important to evaluate the extent of usable data within a 

product coverage.  As a consequence, EO products often contain far more information 

than can easily be presented in a single, static RGB view. 

                                                 

2 The same applies to Remote Sensing instruments used on airborne platforms

Figure 6-1: Example stack of data coverages in the sample dimension of an EO product. 

Note: Only a fraction of the sample information can be visualized using a static RGB image. 

The situation is even worse for the spatial metadata held in a parallel stack of bitmasks 

(see Figure 6-2) because the bitmask information cannot be added to a static RGB image 

without obscuring data and other bitmask information.

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Extension OGC 07-063r1 

Meeting the twin challenges of true interoperability and the full evaluation of the spatial 

elements of EO products (interactive browse), requires the definition of a consistent,

7 Constraints and Conventions of WMS Usage for EO Products 

7.1 Approach 

The definition of a consistent, constrained, interpretation of the WMS standard has two 

aspects: 

1. A WMS metadata model of the spatial data and metadata structure of EO 
datasets; 

2. A defined set of WMS server responses to GetMap requests.   

These aspects are, respectively, addressed in sub-sections 7.2 and 7.3. 

Mandatory constructs and behaviour are defined to provide a simple WMS profile that 

will allow for basic (default) representation of EO products in an interoperable way.  

Additional, optional, elements of the metadata model and WMS server behaviour are 

defined to cater for the full interactive browse and evaluation of EO products.  

7.2 Metadata Model 

The metadata model provides the basic framework, the skeleton, of a WMS instance.  

Defining a WMS metadata model for EO products is therefore a prerequisite for an 

application profile that is unambiguous whilst allowing interactive viewing of all of the 

spatial information within EO products.  Figure 7-1 provides a view of how the normal 

arrangement of EO products can be mirrored using appropriate WMS metadata elements 

and attributes.

Figure 7-1: UML class diagrams showing how the organisation of EO spatial information 

maps to the proposed WMS service metadata model.   

 Note the use of multiplicity on the class associations. 

The handling of service metadata for EO products defined here is in line with Annex C 

(Handling multi-dimensional data) of the WMS 1.3 standard (OGC 06-042).  The 

overview for the WMS 1.3 handling of multi-dimensional data concludes: 

“The server may declare a single name for the layer and enumerate available times and 
wavelength bands in its service metadata. A client then adds additional parameters to 

the GetMap request to request a specific time and band.” 

7.2.1 Mandatory service metadata 

For EO datasets a LAYER service metadata element shall be used to represent each 

dataset series / dataset type.  For instance, all products of type „MERIS instrument, Level 

1b, Reduced Resolution‟ would be described as a dataset series and represented by a 

single LAYER element in the service metadata of a WMS instance.   

EO WMS instances shall support default maps of a given dataset series.  The default 

image map shall be defined as the mandatory dataset series LAYER e.g.: 

<Layer> 

<Name>"MER_RR__2P"</Name> 

… 

</Layer> 

The service metadata shall define a TIME dimension for each LAYER element with a 

value that defines the individual times or range of the available coverage, e.g.: 

<Dimension name="time" units="ISO8601"> 

2002-05-01/2006-09-17/PT1S 

</Dimension> 

The use of the mandatory TIME dimension to retrieve maps from individual EO products 

is defined in subclause 7.3.1.  Because the specification of a TIME value in a GetMap 

request is mandatory, the „default‟ attribute shall not be provided with the TIME 

dimension service metadata. 

The use of other service metadata (nested layers, sample dimensions) in the dataset series 

LAYER is optional and should be used to support interactive browse of EO products. 

7.2.2 Coverage outline service metadata 

To support the discovery of EO products, an optional layer may be used to provide 

outlines of EO products (see Figure 7-5 for example).  If such a layer is used then it shall 

be nested within the dataset series LAYER.  When used, a sub-layer of products outlines 

shall: 

1. be queryable; 

2. use the parent dataset series LAYER name with the suffix „_outlines‟. 

For example: 



 

12 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 
 

 

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Extension OGC 07-063r1 

<Layer queryable="1"> 

<Name>MER_FSO_1P_OUTLINES</Name> 

… 

</Layer> 

Note that the product outlines layer, when used, is queryable in order to support a 

GetFeatureInfo request.  The response to such a request shall include information on any 

EO products who‟s shown outline encloses the geographic location selected by the user.  

The outlines LAYER element shall also contain a STYLE element listing the following 10 

predefined colours as per the SVG 1.1 recognised colour keywords (W3C REC-SVG11-

20030114): 

<Styles=white,yellow,orange,red,magenta,blue,cyan,green,brown,black> 

7.2.3 Band coverage service metadata 

Band coverage datasets refer to a series of coverage datasets that have a common type of 

measurement such as wavelength or polarisation.   

If an EO WMS instance supports the interactive selection and viewing of band coverage 

datasets then these shall be held in a LAYER nested in the main dataset series (data-type) 

LAYER.  This nested LAYER shall: 

1. use the parent dataset series LAYER name with the suffix „_bands‟; 

2. have one (or more) sample dimension shall be defined as properties of this 
„_bands‟ layer in the service metadata. 

For instance, consider a WMS instance that supports interactive browsing of a series of 

polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar datasets.  The sample dimension within the 

LAYER element of the dataset series might be defined as: 

<Layer> 

<Name>ASA_APP_1P_BANDS</Name> 

<Dimension name="polarization_(intensity)" units=""  

 multipleValues=”1”> 

HH, VV, HV, VH 

</Dimension> 

</Layer> 

Similarly, datasets from a passive sensor that detects upwelling radiance in a number of 

wavebands might be defined as: 

<Layer> 

<Name>MODIS_L1B_BANDS</Name> 

<Dimension name="wavelength" units="nano metres" unitSymbol="nm" 

 multipleValues=”1”> 

412.5, 442.5, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665 

</Dimension> 

</Layer> 

7.2.4 Geophysical parameter service metadata 

Geophysical parameter datasets differ from band datasets in that each coverage has a 

distinct unit of measure.  Geophysical datasets are typically displayed in pseudo-colour 

with a colour key relating parameter values to image colour (see Figure 7.2).

Figure 7-2: Example geophysical parameter map, in pseudo-colour with associated colour legend.   

To support interactive browse, the service metadata shall define each geophysical 

parameter as a LAYER nested in the main dataset series (data-type) LAYER.  Geophysical 

parameter layers shall: 

1. use the parent dataset series LAYER name with the suffix „_‟ and the name of the 

geophysical parameter ; 

2. have an associated style containing a LegendURL element whose value shall link 
to a graphical colour key. 

7.2.5 Spatial metadataset (bitmask) service metadata 

Subtle variations in values across coverage datasets can be presented as greyscale or 

colour image maps in a number of ways (see Section 7.3.3), often through Red Green 

Blue (RGB) colour combination.  Bitmasks, however, represent spatial metadata flags 

that are either „on‟ or „off‟‟ which can be represented using single colour maps that hide 

the underlying map of coverage datasets as shown in Figure 7-3 below.   

Sample dimensions cannot be used to represent the bitmask stack as the assignment / 

reassignment of colours to sample dimensions is not supported in WMS 1.3.  To provide 

the required degree of flexibility, each bitmask shall be represented as a nested LAYER 

element (see Figure 7-1).  Each bitmask LAYER shall: 

1. use the parent dataset series LAYER name with the suffix „_‟ and the name of the 

flag; 

2. have an associated STYLE element listing the following 10 predefined colours as 

per the SVG 1.1 recognised colour keywords (W3C REC-SVG11-20030114): 

<Styles=white,yellow,orange,red,magenta,blue,cyan,green,brown,black>

Note that four contrasting colours have been chosen to represent the bitmasks. 

7.3 GetMap Request/Response 

Where the service metadata model provides the skeleton for this WMS profile, the 

definition of the GetMap request/response adds the functional muscle that ultimately 

delivers the rendered image maps back to the client application of a user.  The default 

behaviour needed to support consistent WMS handling for EO products is defined in 

subclause 7.3.1.  Subclause 7.3.2 describes the response to a GetMap request for product 

outlines.  The behaviour needed to support interactive browse and evaluation of EO 

products is defined in subclauses 7.3.4, 7.3.5 and 7.2.5. 

7.3.1 Presentation of default coverage maps 

This subclause covers the client – server handling of the mandatory service elements 

without reference to specific coverage dataset or spatial metadataset elements.  Subclause 

7.2.1 defined the use of LAYER elements to identify dataset series with the TIME 

dimension used to identify individual EO products.  An example GetMap request is given 

below with the mandatory parts of the request shown in bold.  

http://eoltd.co.uk/mapserver.cgi?VERSION=1.3.0   

 &REQUEST=GetMap 

 &CRS=CRS:84  

 &BBOX=79.105,24.913,91.794,36.358  

 &WIDTH=350 

 &HEIGHT=350  

 &LAYERS=MER_RR__2P&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png 

 &TIME=2002-07-30/2002-07-31/P1D

When no coverage dataset sample dimensions, geophysical parameter or bitmask sub-

layers are defined in the GetMap request then the WMS server shall respond by returning 

a default map of the requested EO product(s), as shown in Figure 7-4 below.   In other 

words, no nested layers shall be returned when just the group dataset series / data type 

layer is defined in the GetMap request.

 Multi-waveband product map returned as an RGB false colour composite; 

 Geophysical parameter map returned as a pseudo-colour image, with colour legend. 

Note that when there is no exact match for the requested TIME value, the server response 

may include a „nearest value used‟ warning as per subclause C.4.3 of OGC 06-042. 

7.3.2 Presentation of outline coverage maps 

Where supported (see subclause 7.2.2), an outline view of available EO products may be 

requested by specifying the name of the queryable outline layer in the GetMap request.  

The returned map shall support the GetFeatureInfo operation.  If a GetFeatureInfo request 

is made for a location within a product outline, the response shall contain metadata about 

the acquisition time of the product(s), encoded with an XML MIME type, ideally as 

GML for EO products (see OGC 06-080).  This time metadata can then be used to 

construct a specific GetMap request for a view of the individual product.

caused by overlapping images of EO products.

7.3.3 Presentation of band coverage maps 

The type of rendering of band datasets carried out by the WMS server shall depend on the 

number of sample dimension values requested.  Only one or three sample dimension 

values may be specified per GetMap request.  If any other number of sample dimension 

values is requested then the server shall issue a service exception (code = 

InvalidDimensionValue). 

A GetMap request for a single dataset in the sample dimension shall be served by a 

greyscale image as illustrated in Figure 7-6.

colour composite;

7.3.4 Presentation of geophysical parameter coverage maps 

A GetMap request for a geophysical parameter LAYER nested in the sample dimension 

shall be served as a pseudo colour image with a colour legend (see Figure 7-2 for 

example). 

7.3.5 Presentation of metadataset coverage (bitmask) maps 

As noted in Section 7.2.5, the spatial metadataset (bitmask) stacks are defined using 

layers nested within each dataset series layer.  This nesting should be reflected in the 

name of each nested bitmask layer by using the parent layer name to prefix the nested 

bitmask layer names.  For instance, the bitmask CLOUD within the dataset series 

MER_RR__2P would have the layer name MER_RR__2P_CLOUD.   

An example GetMap request is given below: 

http://eoltd.co.uk/mapserver.cgi?VERSION=1.3.0 

 &REQUEST=GetMap&CRS=CRS:84  

 &BBOX=78.105,24.913,94.794,36.358

 MER_RR__2P_SUSPECT 

 &STYLES=,CYAN,ORANGE,MAGENTA,GREEN 

 &FORMAT=image/png  

 &TIME=2005-10-05T07:25:00

Note that the parent dataset series layer is listed with the bitmask layers and that the 

corresponding styles list has a blank (default) entry for the parent dataset series layer.

Annex A 
(normative) 

 
Abstract Test Suite  

A.1 Introduction 

An Abstract Test Suite (ATS), as defined in ISO 19105, is an abstract test module 

specifying all the requirements to be satisfied for conformance. As such, an ATS provides 

a basis for developing an executable test suite (ETS) to verify that the implementation 

under test (IUT) conforms to all relevant functional specifications. 

 

This annex provides a compendium of test assertions applicable to Web Map Server 

(WMS) implementations of the WMS 1.3 Application Profile for EO Products (OGC 07-

063r1).  This ATS also covers WMS 1.1.1 servers which conform to the service metadata 

and GetMap behaviour of the EO Profile.   

The abstract test cases (assertions) are organized into classes of conformance that 

correspond to sets of capabilities.  The following classes of conformance are defined:  

1. WMS-Get Capabilities – GetCapabilities Request and Response  

2. WMS-GetMap – TIME specification, default map, product outline map, band 

coverage map, geophysical parameter map and spatial metadata (bitmask) map 

responses.  

3. WMS-GetFeatureInfo – product metadata request via product bounding box 

outline LAYERs.  

Two conformance levels are defined: 

 Level 1 – test cases covering all mandatory requirements to be satisfied by a 
minimally conformant server implementation;  

 Level 2 – test cases addressing desirable, but optional, behaviour requirements.  

Note that the use in this document of uppercase to denote elements in XML text has no 

significance in either Web service requests or responses.  

A.1.1 Limitations 

There are some limitations and conditions to the ATS: 

 Only the WMS server is tested, not the client;  

 The test assertions only apply to the specialist constraints and behaviour defined 
in OGC 07-063r1 (the 'EO profile') and not to the full WMS 1.3 standard.

Annex C 
(informative)  

 
Guidance on integrated discovery and viewing of EO Products  

(linking the WMS, CS-W and GML EOP extensions) 

C.1 Introduction 

This annex considers different scenarios for the discovery and viewing of EO products.  

Based on this context, it provides guidance to facilitate the integration of EOP Catalogue 

Service Web (CS-W) and Web Map Service instances. 

C.2 EOP discovery and viewing scenarios 

Three scenarios for the discovery and viewing of EO products are introduced and 

discussed (see Figure C.1 below). 

 

Figure C.1: UML diagram showing three use cases through which a catalogue 

and WMS client may be used to discover and view EO products 

C.2.1 Discovery and viewing via an EOP WMS 

This scenario allows the discovery of EO products using only the host Web Map Service 

however this architectural simplicity is offset by: 

1. added WMS client complexity; 

2. isolation of each Web Map Service instance from a wider, federated set of 
geographic Web services. 

With reference to Figure C.2 below, it can also be seen that the search procedure is quite 

iterative, involving four request-response interactions between use (client) and WMS 

server.

Figure C.2:  UML diagram showing the flow of activity between the WMS user and a 

WMS instance extended for EO product viewing. 

C.2.2 Viewing following collection level discovery 

In this scenario, a user discovers an EOP collection (dataset series) via a CS-W instance 

that supports the Core ISO Metadata (CIM) mapping to the ebRIM CS-W profile (OGC 

07-038).  Comparing Figures C.2 and C.3, this scenario shows the same degree of user – 

Web service iteration because the user is only using the catalogue to carry out collection 

(dataset series) level discovery.  This scenario does have the following advantages 

compared to the other scenarios considered: 

1. the catalogue search is relatively generic as it does not have a dependency on 
the EOP CS-W extension (OGC 06-131); 

2. a user does not need to know, a priori, the location of any instances of the WMS 
EOP viewing service and is able to search from range of registered collections 
with associated viewing services.

series (EOP collection)  catalogue and an EOP WMS instance 

Note: in this diagram it is assumed that value of the ResoureceMetadat.Image.name 

parameter is a URL containing the GetMap request for the collection outlines 

map Layer. 

C.2.3 Viewing following specific dataset (EOP) discovery 

The most user-friendly scenario involves the use of a catalogue service supporting the EO 

Products extension package for ebRIM [4].  In this use case, a number of distributed EOP 

collections can be searched by data type, times and spatial areas of interest.  Ideally this 

should allow a user to carry out discovery of a specific EOP then select a „browse‟ option 

and seamlessly be provided with a WMS EOP extension view of the product See Figure 

C.4 below).

extension catalogue and an EOP WMS instance

parameter contains a URL for a Web Map Context document. 

C.3 Guidance on CS-W / WMS EO extension integration 

C.3.1 Metadata linkage 

The ISO 19115 MD_Metadata.parentIdentifier value for a dataset equates to the parent 

dataset series i.e. a collection of EO products.  The group Layer in the service metadata 

model of the WMS EO extension also equates to a dataset series and hence, to a 

collection of EO products.  To reflect this equivalence, group Layer names should 

follow the convention for parentIdentifier naming set out in the EO Products extension to 

the ebRIM CS Application Profile [4] where the following representation is proposed: 

programme.satellite_instrument_processing

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Extension OGC 07-063r1 

Examples of parentIdentifier are:  

 urn:ogc:def:EOP:ESA:EECF.ENVISAT_ASA_APx_xS 

 urn:ogc:def:EOP:ESA:UK-MM-PAF.ENVISAT_MER_MTCI_FCR_3P 

C.3.2 Programmatic linkage 

Conceptually, a WMS instance can be thought of as providing either a browse service or 

a distribution service.  In the ISO 19115 metadata model this would equate to either: 

 an MD_BrowseGraphic.fileName attribute value 

 or an MD_Distribution->transferOptions->MD_DigitalTransferOptions->onLine-> 
CI_OnlineResource definition. 

The URI value of an MD_BrowseGraphic.fileName attribute is typically a URL 

providing the Web address of a browse image, often a thumbnail.  A static GetMap 

request URL may be provided as a MD_BrowseGraphic.fileName attribute value in order 

to link a CS-W EOP metadata record directly to a WMS EOP view.  This direct approach 

is appropriate for viewing a thumbnail image but it is inflexible as it provides no context 

about the host WMS service.  Figure C.5 shows the use of EOP service metadata context 

by a how a WMS client to define the GUI controls required for interactive viewing.

geophysical parameter and bitmask Layers based on the WMS metadata 

for a given EO collection

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Extension OGC 07-063r1 

To provide the context necessary to link a catalogue record to a WMS EO extension 

view, two recommendations are made: 

1. Define the WMS EO extension linkage within the ISO 19115 MD_Distribution 
metadata via the MD_DigitalTransferOptions -> CI_OnlineResource class.  The 

ISO 19115 CI_OnlineResource class augments a URL „linkage‟ attribute with 

optional attributes for service „protocol‟ and „applicationProfile‟ definition 

providing a more complete and appropriate way to link a CS-W record to a WMS 

service (see C.3.2.1 XML snippet for an example).   

2. Supply a service description via a Web Map Context (WMC) document.  Each 
WMC document should list the WMS metadata for the parentIdentifier (EO 

collection) identified via a catalogue search.  In this scenario, the owner of a 

WMS instance would publish a WMC document for each group Layer (EO 

collection) available.  A CS-W server would then point to the appropriate WMC 

file via a URL given in the MD_DigitalTransferOptions -> CI_OnlineResource.-> 

description.   

Figure C.6 shows how the information obtained from a WMC document could be: 

1. used by an EOP WMS client to define the GUI map view selection tools; 

2. combined with spatial and temporal catalogue search (or EOP record) parameters 
to define the GetMap URL needed to request a view of the specific EOP. 

 

Figure C.6: scenario illustrating the use of a WMC document both to configure a WMS client 

for interactive browse and to generate the EOP specific GetMap request 

Note: this scenario requires the catalogue client to recognise  and specifically respond to, a 

EO:BrowseInformation.fileName URL for a Web Map Context document.

Note that this example provides two URL values.  The „linkage‟ URL defines a static 

GetMap request that can be used by any WMS client.  The „description‟ URL provides 

the location of the WMC for the parent dataset series.
