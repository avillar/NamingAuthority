OGC Web Services Common Standard version 2.0.0 
Corrigendum 

1 Scope 

This document being corrected specifies many of the aspects that are, or should be, common 
to all or multiple OWS interface Implementation Specifications. The Common 
Implementation Specification aspects specified by this document currently include:  

a) Operation request and response contents, most partial  

b) Parameters and data structures included in operation requests and responses  

c) XML and KVP encoding of operation requests and responses  

One use of this document is as a normative reference from future versions of OWS interface 
Implementation Specifications. Those specifications currently include the Web Map Service 
(WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS). Rather than 
continuing to repeat this material in each such Implementation Specification, each 
specification should normatively reference each relevant part of this document.  

This corrigendum corrects an error in the online owsGetCapabilities.xsd file associated with 
the OGC Web Services Common version 2.0.0 that prevents multi-language use.
