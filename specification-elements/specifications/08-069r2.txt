      Overview

      This document is an abstract test suite (ATS): a compendium of test 
      assertions applicable to all implementations of the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) specification. 
      An ATS provides a basis for developing an executable test suite (ETS) to 
      verify that the implementation under test (IUT) conforms to all relevant 
      functional specifications.

      The abstract test cases (assertions) are organized into test groups 
      that correspond to distinct conformance classes or sets of capabilities
      defined in the WCPS specification (see below for the version it applies to).
      The following mandatory test groups are defined:

      	ProcessCoverages - core WCPS request type

What is tested

	ProcessCoverages request type



Test prerequisites



In preparation of the test the following prerequisites a WCPS service with the following features shall be installed:


	WCPS supports at least one data format for which a WCS encoding format extension exists
	WCPS contains at least one georeferenced coverage which supports at least one CRS beyond its ImageCRS
	WCPS coverage(s) further fulfill the requirements listed below



Further, a WCPS client shall be available for testing which allows to submit requests and protocol results (best in batch mode).





Test Data


The following test data set shall be available in the WCPS server under test.


	coverage objects:

	dimension	axes	cell type	CRSs
	1-D	x	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	1-D	x	float	ImageCRS
	1-D	x	RGB	ImageCRS
	1-D	x	complex	ImageCRS
	1-D	y	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	1-D	z	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	1-D	time	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	2-D	x/y	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS; WGS84-2D
	2-D	x/z	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	2-D	x/time	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	3-D	x/y/z	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	3-D	x/y/time	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS
	4-D	x/y/z/time	(unsigned) char	ImageCRS; WGS84-3D + time


  	all coverages have the same size (domain extent) per domain axis: 0..300; this defines their ImageCRS.
  
	coverage contents:

	for coverages with cell type char: for coordinates x, y, z, t in [0..300]: cell[x,y,z,t] = (x+y+z+t) mod 256
    
	for coverages with cell type RGB: for coordinates x, y, z, t in [0..300]: cell[x,y,z,t] = (x+y+z+t) mod 256;
    cell.green[x,y,z,t] = (x+y+z+t+1) mod 256;
    cell.blue[x,y,z,t] = (x+y+z+t+2) mod 256
    
	for coverages with cell type float: for coordinates t in [0..300]: cell[t] = t * 1,000,000 - 150,000,000
  




Schemas



  No schema is needed by this ATS for validation.
  However, for executing the tests a carrier protocol is needed which is specified in WCS Processing Extensions document.

        3. ProcessCoverages

      

    
  
  Purpose

  The ProcessCoverages test group consists of the assertions
  that validate the ProcessCoverages request type of the WCPS specification.
  

  




  
    
    Table 3.. ProcessCoverages - for loop	Test case identifier	WCPS.ProcessCoverage-for
	Test purpose	A for loop iterating over a specified list of coverages must apply its evaluation to every coverage enumerated in proper sequence.
          
	Test method	
            Send a request against more than one test coverages and check whether the responses matches in the number of elements returned as well as the value of each element.
            Pass if assertions hold; fail otherwise.
            

            In particular, this involves testing of these cases:
            	loop with a single variable, iterating over one coverage: check that result is valid for processing this coverage.
              
	loop with a single variable, iterating over >1 coverages: check that results are valid for the resp. coverages.
              
	loop with at least two (nested) variables, iterating over more than one coverages each: check that each coverage is evaluated, and combination of variables in the expression is evaluated correctly.

    Table 3.. ProcessCoverages - coverage filtering	Test case identifier	WCPS.ProcessCoverage-where
	Test purpose	Verify that the where clause fires properly.
          
	Test method	Send requests against more than one of the test coverages containing a where clause. Test the following cases:
            	"... where true ... "
              
	"... where false ... "
              
	"... where P ... " with P being a predicate which evaluates to true on at least one coverage given and to false on at least one coverage given
            


            Pass if assertions hold; fail otherwise.

    Table 3.. ProcessCoverages - response storage	Test case identifier	WCPS.ProcessCoverage-store
	Test purpose	If a request contains a store() function invocation then the server must store the response and deliver a URL under which said response can be retrieved.
          
	Test method	Send a request against one of the test coverages applying the store() function on the result. Check the URL retrieved whether (i) it can be opened to deliver a data file and (ii) the file retrieved contains the proper contents.
            Pass if assertions hold; fail otherwise.

    Table 3.. ProcessCoverages - data format encoding	Test case identifier	WCPS.ProcessCoverage-encode
	Test purpose	The server must properly encode a coverage-valued response in any of the data formats advertised in its capabilities.
          
	Test method	For each encoding format listed in the server's capabilities, send a request against one of the test coverages (whose dimension and range allows encoding in that format) applying the encode() function on the result using that data format.
           Check whether the result stream (i) can be opened using a standard tool and (ii) contains the proper contents.
           Pass if assertions hold; fail otherwise.

	Test method	
            Send requests against one of the test coverages which first sets a metadata property and then retrieves it.
            For several properties setting happens directly via the resp. metadata functions,
            for others - like the coverage's domain extent - an appropriate coverage manipulation has to be performed, such as trimming or slicing.
