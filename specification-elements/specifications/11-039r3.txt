i.  Abstract 
Common semantics support the reference of features to the concept they represent and 
the integration of data proceed using the semantic framework such mappings provide. 
However there is no standard conceptual model for hydrologic feature identification. 
Different models of hydrologic processes, and different scales of detail, lead to a variety 
of information models to describe these features, and to different and mostly 
incompatible sets of feature identifiers.  

This document describes requirements and a proposed design for a domain model of 
hydrologic features as a set of interrelated Application Schemas using the ISO 19109 
General Feature Model,

Introduction 

The WMO is the UN system's authoritative voice on the state and behavior of the Earth's 
atmosphere, its interaction with the oceans, the climate it produces and the resulting 
distribution of water resources. It facilitates the free and unrestricted exchange of data, 
products and services and contributes to policy formulation at national and international 
levels. 

The WMO promotes the utilization of international industry standards for transfer 
protocols, hardware and software enabling the routine data collection and automated 
dissemination of observed data as well as ad-hoc requests for data and products. Being a 
recognized international standardization body, WMO has the mandate to set standards in 
these areas.  

The water related activities of the WMO are shaped by the Commission for Hydrology 
(WMO-CHy). This includes advice on the standardization of various aspects of 
hydrologic observations, as well as on the sharing and exchanging of hydrologic data 
using modern information and communication technology. 

The need for a domain-specific feature model emerges from the requirement to integrate 
data and information across multiple systems, emerging from the global geographic 
distribution of jurisdiction over water resources and the multiple systems and sub-
domains that concern or interact with the hydrology domain. To communicate compatible 
data and information about a distinct state of a hydrologic process, to integrate multiple 
or cross-reference alternative representations of a hydrologic feature, it becomes 
necessary to identify the concepts shared in different application contexts and to express 
the semantics of hydrologic features commonly used in disparate and differently 
structured data products.  

1. Scope 

This is an OGC Discussion Paper for review by OGC members and other interested 
parties. It is a working draft document and may be updated, replaced by other documents 
at any time. It is inappropriate to use OGC Discussion Papers as reference material or to 
cite them as other than “work in progress.”  

This document was produced as part of the joint WMO/OGC Hydrology Domain 
Working Group activity. It is intended to become a candidate for a WMO Best Practice 
for implementation under the auspices of the WMO-CHy and release to the hydrologic 
community of WMO Member countries. 

This document describes a conceptual model for the identification of hydrologic features 
independent from geometric representation and scales. This model allows common 
reference to hydrologic features across scientific sub-disciplines in hydrology. The 
Hydrologic Feature Model, HY_Features, is designed as a set of interrelated Application 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC ix 
  

Schemas using ISO 19103 Conceptual Schema Language and ISO 19109 General Feature 
Model. It is factored into relatively simple components that can be reviewed, tested and 
extended independently. 

2. Conformance 

The standardization (conformance) target of the HY_Features model is a related  
application schema for a data product describing hydrologic features. Such an application 
schema may be either the direct encoding of HY_Features or another schema formally 
mapped to HY_Features equivalent classes and properties. The conceptual model 
addresses the general requirements to integrate hydrologic data and information available 
across the scientific and technical programs of the WMO, to assist the WMO Members to 
discover, access und use hydrologic data from different sources.  

However, the conceptual model raises a series of opportunities and requirements for 
testing in the context of many application domains related to hydrologic processes. 
Appropriate conformance requirements need to be defined in respect to the use of the 
model to support hydrologic referencing and system interoperability of information 
services and in data infrastructures. 

Conformance to the HY_Features model requires that an implementation is able to: 

 a) map the feature type of each implemented GF_Feature to the equivalent 
concept in HY_Features, wherever such an instance of such a feature may be 
referenced as a hydrologic feature 

 b) map all properties of the implemented feature to the equivalent property  
expressed by feature properties within the HY_Features model where such a 
mapping exists 

The precise mechanism for such a mapping is not defined at this stage.

4. Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply. 

The HY_Features model uses as far as possible the terminology recommended for use in 
the WMO Member countries and represented by the “UNESCO/WMO International 
Glossary of Hydrology” [1].Whenever an appropriate definition is provided in this 
glossary, the model captures this meaning and relationships to define relevant features 
and feature properties. 

4.1 application schema 
conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications 
[ISO 19101].  

NOTE:  In general, a schema is an abstract representation of an object's characteristics and relationship to 
other objects. An XML schema represents the relationship between the attributes and elements of an 
XML object (for example, a document or a portion of a document) 

4.2 basin 
hydrologic unit wherein all incoming water is channeled to a common outlet.  

NOTE:  The common outlet of a basin may be a particular location, but also a body of water. It may be a 
real place or a fictive one built from joining several places. 

4.3 catchment 
distinct unit catching something, e.g. water.   

NOTE:  Across scientific disciplines in the domain of hydrology, a catchment is commonly recognized as 
the basic unit of study and reporting. . 

4.4 domain feature 
feature of a type defined within a particular application domain. 
[ISO19156] 

4.5 feature 
abstraction of real-world phenomena 
[ISO19101] 

4.6 hydrographic network 
aggregate of water bodies, aggregated using a connecting system.  
 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC xi 
  

4.7 hydrography 
science dealing with the description and measurement of open bodies of water. 
[WMO1992] 

NOTE:  In this context, hydrography refers to the description of  water bodies. Its measurement in terms 
of surveying, e.g. for navigational purposes, is not in the concern of the HY-Features model.  

4.8 hydrologic feature 
abstract notion of the hydrology phenomenon. 

4.9 hydrology 
science that deals with the waters above and below the land surfaces of the Earth, their 
occurrence, circulation and distribution, both in time and space, their biological, chemical 
and physical properties, their reaction with their environment, including their relation to 
living beings.  
[WMO1992] 

4.10 hydrometric  feature 
real-world phenomenon which forms part of a hydrometric network. 

NOTE:  The hydrometric feature refers to a physical structure intended to observe properties of a 
hydrologic feature. Used to sample a hydrologic feature, a hydrometric feature may be considered a 
sampling feature of observation. A sampling feature is described in general in ISO 19156, the special 
monitoring point of hydrologic observation is described in the WaterML 2.0 Specification. 

4.11 hydrometry 
science of the measurement and analysis of water including methods, techniques and 
instrumentation used in hydrology. 
[WMO1992] 

4.12 mapping 
mapping of elements of disparate representations of a hydrologic feature.  

NOTE:  In the context of common semantics, it refers to concept mapping particularly to an agreed  
reference  concept. 

4.13 multilingual keyword 
keyword used in a multilingual context.  

NOTE:  A keyword is generally described in ISO 19115. 

4.14 named feature 
feature identified by a name. 

NOTE:  Hydrologic features and their real-world representations have names within common experience, 
but may have different names in their cultural, political and historical contexts. 

4.15 observable property 
characteristic of a phenomenon subject to observation. 
[ISO 19156]  



OGC 11-039r3 

xii Copyright © 2014 OGC 
 

NOTE:  The observable property may be indirect, relying on direct observation of a more convenient 
parameter [observed property], which is a proxy for the ultimate [observable] property of interest. 

4.16 representation 
real-world phenomenon representing an abstract feature. 

4.17 river positioning system 
linear system used to reference indirect positions along a watercourse.  

NOTE:  The concept of indirect position describes a location on the land surface relative to or as a 
distance to a reference point located in a hydrographic network on a hydrographic feature applying a 
linear coordinate system. Position may be described relative to the reference point as distance , 
percentage of this, , or expressed verbally.  

4.18 sampling feature 
artifacts of an observational strategy … intended to sample some feature of interest in an 
application domain. 
[ISO 19156] 

4.19 storage 
impounding of water in surface or underground reservoirs, for future use. 
[WMO1992] 

NOTE:  Storage refers to a water body in terms of a usable water resource. The management of the 
reservoir as human action with the objective to efficient and sustainable use the resource, is not in the 
scope of  the HY_Features model. Yet, often an indication is required whether a water body is used 
for storage. 

4.20 variable 
characteristic carried by a real-world phenomenon liable to change.  

NOTE:  Values expressing the change are usually obtained by observing the variable. A variable may 
take any value in a range of possible values.  

NOTE:  A variable may be a quantity having a magnitude, additive or non-additive, or multitude whose 
values can be expressed by a number, but also a nominal property expressed using words, alpha-
numeric codes, or Boolean values. 

4.21 water body 
mass of water distinct from other masses of water is considered a water body. 
[WMO1992] 

NOTE:  A water body represents a hydrologic feature in the real world. A water body may be segmented 
in single parts which are real-world phenomena itself.

6. HY_Features: A Common Hydrologic Feature Model 

6.1 Scope of the hydrologic feature model 
The HY_Features model defines the semantics of features which are the overall objects 
of study and reporting in hydrology and its associated scientific disciplines. It provides a 
means to identify these features independent from scale of geographic representation. It 
also enables multiple representations of these (real-world) features, with alternative data 
models,  to be linked to the ultimate object of study or reporting. 

The initial scope of this model is defined by the concerns of the WMO-CHy to facilitate 
the data sharing within the hydrologic community of the WMO Member countries and to 
improve the quality of data products based in these data. Interoperability of observing 
systems needs standardized formats and transfer routines, such as WaterML 2, however 
the compatibility of data products also requires agreed concepts to describe the features 
of shared interest. In the hydrology domain these features represent results of the 
hydrologic processes at various stages of the water cycle, relevant to study and report the 
“waters above and below the land surfaces of the Earth, their occurrence, circulation and 
distribution, both in time and space, their biological, chemical and physical properties, 
and their reaction with their environment”[1]. This scope includes well-established data 
models and patterns in use in the hydrology domain, since the intended goal is to support 
these using a common conceptual model. 

The HY_Features model is intended to sufficiently describe hydrologic features 
referenced in the various data sets in current use and to form a basis for a common and 
stable referencing of these features to assist the organization of their observation and 
modeling as well as the aggregation of generated data into integrated suites of datasets 
on a global, regional, or basin scale.  

The model encompasses different approaches of modeling hydrologic features, but 
enforces the semantics of relationships between different levels of detail. This provides a 
semantic framework for feature identifiers to be developed and embedded in individual 
data products without constraining the flexibility required to model complex 
hydrological processes at fine detail.  

6.1.1 HY_Features in the overall context of OGC standards 
The HY_Features model defines hydrology domain-specific implementations of the 
general FeatureType (aka GF_FeatureType) metaclass.  Since its concern is primarily 
the issue of feature identification, a basic class HY_HydroFeature is defined wherever 
hydrological features are required to be references. (Figure 1) This class is intended to 
specify the GFI_Feature in terms of the sampled feature of observation as currently 
required by the ISO 19156 Observation and Measurements model (O&M).  Specifically,

landscape. For applications in hydrology, particularly in the context of hydrologic 
observation and sampling, the proposed HY_HydroFeature will represent the ultimate 
subject of observation, the intended sampled DomainFeature and may be used by 
observation-centric applications such as WaterML2.  

6.1.2 HY_Features in the overall context of the WMO Information System 
WIS, the WMO Information System, provides mechanisms for the international 
exchange of information related to weather, climate and water. In this framework, the 
WMO Core Metadata Profile version 1.3 [4] was developed. This specification defines 
the content, structure and encoding of discovery metadata published within the WIS 
Discovery-Access-Retrieval (DAR) Catalogue. The metadata standard defined as an 
informal category-1 profile of the ISO 19115:2003 ‘Geographic information – Metadata’  

WIGOS, the WMO Integrated Global Observing System, is a coordinated system which 
is comprised of the present WMO global observing systems. Complementary to the 
WMO Core Metadata Profile, a WIGOS Core Metadata Standard is under development 
that allows the essential observational information to be exchanged unambiguously, 
regardless of the format used for the transfer. 

In this context,  the HY_Features model will provide a required component of a metadata 
model describing hydrologic data sets and products generated from observation. Other 
controlled vocabularies will be required, and a binding mechanism to specify how these 
independently governed and published components can be combined.  

An approach under consideration is the concept of GRDC Hydrologic Metadata [5] for 
the description of data sets, particularly time series, created by further processing of data 
from a preceding observation.  This concept under development by the Global Runoff 
Data Centre (GRDC) of the WMO refers to the basic concepts of the O&M model  [2] 
and will use ISO19115-1:2012 ‘Metadata-Fundamentals’ (under development) [6] and 
the time series description of WaterML2 [4]. The HY_Features features types are used to 
relate the spatial or temporal coverages to the river basin they represent (Figure 2 ) .

6.1.3 Properties of hydrologic features and its observation 
Hydrologic objects (real-world phenomena) have characteristic properties  that change 
according to continuous hydrologic processes. Values expressing this change are usually 
obtained by observing a Variable related to these characteristics. Such a Variable may 
have different roles in different contexts: observable property, observed property, 
measurand of an instrument, reported characteristic, base of a derived variable, a process 
variable under control, an assessment criterion, etc.. Different concepts at different levels 
of detail from different perspectives are in use to identify these variables, quantities as 
well as nominal properties.  



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 5 
 

O&M defines observation as “an act that results in the estimation of a feature property” 
[2], thus in principle each such Variable shall be an instance of the general PropertyType 
(aka GF_PropertyType) metaclass. The determination of what such a named property 
may be called or mean is bound to observation processes themselves, and the variety of 
these cannot be determined in advance, Thus, observable characteristics are not generally 
in the scope of the HY_Features model. The relation between the hydrologic feature and 
its observable variables needs to be specified at the application level. HY_Features 
supports this allowing alternative sets of properties to be bound to a common concept of 
a named feature.

6.2 General requirements for a Common Hydrologic Feature Model  
Hydrologic processes are constrained by and interact with the landscape and the medium 
in which they occur. These interactions are complex and variable through time. It is 
common practice to identify and refer to specific instances of a hydrologic feature when 
describing the state of any of these hydrologic processes or associated human activities. 
Persistent landscape features such as catchment, basin, watershed or water body are 
classic examples of concepts, common in many fields of discourse, but yet different 
according to the focus on various aspects of the hydrology phenomenon. 

Hydrologic processes commonly are studied and reported in logical units related to the 
behavior of water. Depending on application and scale these units are multiple 
represented in the real world by a variety of phenomena, either single objects or a 
composite or network of these. The reference to the shared unit of study by different 
applications may be challenging if different semantics and identifiers are used for 
different delineations. Stable and persistent identifiers are required to reflect hydrologic 
significance and topological connectivity of features across disparate representations and 
different scales. 

A re-usable core of generally applicable concepts, capable of being partially realized in 
existing implementations, may increase the acceptance of the model in the addressed 
community. The required governance by an accepted, internationally acting authority, 
like the WMO, will be supported by a canonical form, implementation neutrality and 
conformity to internationally recognized standards.  

6.2.1 General Applicability 
To be generally applicable to a wide range of applications where hydrologic feature 
identification needs to be persisted or shared, feature characterizations given in different 
systems must be supported without specifying what characteristics may be assigned in a 
specific context. Instead of being a comprehensive set of all, or commonly used 
characteristics, a re-usable core model is required that supports application specific 
specializations. For example, an application concerned with rainfall runoff could extend 
the model to include soil moisture and land cover parameters that are not necessary to 
define the unit of study itself. A representation such as a remote-sensed grid field can be 
added for any parameter, as could a simple attribute for a characteristic value. Numerical 
model starting conditions and parameters may be provided on the basis of 
characterization of e.g. basin features, and model outputs may be reported at basin scale 
or combined into a single result on the basis of the hydrologic connectivity of basins. 

In cross-border applications and as part of global information frameworks the naming of 
a feature within different cultures and languages is a fundamental issue. The same 
feature may be named differently according to locale and usage. Names may apply to 
part of a feature only. Provided practitioners in the field of hydrology can successfully 
share meaning and feature identifiers, a full conceptual model of toponymy is not 
required. Nevertheless, the cultural, political and historical variability and the 
relationships between alternative names needs to be handled.  



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 7 
 

6.2.2 Stability of Identifiers 
Stability of identifiers means that factors that change the representation of a feature in an 
information system, should not change the identifier of the feature itself. Such factors 
may be the improved resolution or accuracy of representation, minor changes to physical 
characteristics of the feature that occur over time, but also changes of technology 
platform, implementation or custodian. It is a core requirement of general applicability 
(6.2.1) to support stability of identifiers across different representations to allow multiple 
systems to use, or map to, these identifiers.  

With regard to hydrology, identifiers must be able to stably reflect the hydrologic 
significance of a feature regarding both its contributing catchment and its topological 
connectivity to upstream and downstream features. Those features that can be given 
stable identifiers in this context must be distinguished from those that are defined within 
the context of a specific representation. For example, a DEM derived drainage network 
will have many predicted flow lines, but these may be simply a function of the resolution 
of the DEM, and not reflect physical reality. Key features such as major confluences may 
be represented, often due to drainage enforcement from vector representations, but 
nevertheless identifiable features. 

6.2.3 Scale-independence 
Hydrologic features exist at any scale, from a continental scale river basin to the basin 
upstream of any point in a detailed river network. Whether observing, modeling or 
reporting, the choice of the scale made by the user depends on the special purpose of its 
study. Some scales seems to be more or less general because of their wide range of use, 
but always chosen for a specific purpose, e.g. for mapping or comparative reporting, they 
are still distinct.  

Scaling up or down leads to multiple representations of the same hydrologic feature. A 
common model must support simplifications at small scales and details at large scales 
allowing hydrologic feature complexes to be potentially encapsulated within simpler 
features at a less detailed scale. The co-existence of multiple hierarchical aggregations of 
features into alternative networks needs to be supported. 

The requirement for identifier stability (6.2.2) implies that the same features must be 
identifiable where present in different scales of mapping. Reporting on a coarse scale 
needs to be supported as well as aggregating features at finer levels of detail in a 
consistent fashion to generate information at coarser scales. 

6.2.4 Governance 
The introduction and enforcement of standard practices in a large, heterogeneous 
community require promotion, guidance and advice by an authority accepted within the 
addressed community. Being the authoritative voice of UN, the WMO provides the 
framework for the leadership of the WMO-CHy in administration and management of 
best practices in the hydrologic community of WMO Member countries. 



OGC 11-039r3 

8 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

To be accepted as a Best Practice by the WMO-CHy, a common model shall not 
contradict existing positions of the WMO. This implies two other requirements. The first 
and most important is conformity, where applicable, to existing definitions defined and 
endorsed by the WMO–CHy. The key reference here is the UNESCO/WMO 
International Glossary of Hydrology [1]. The second implication is that the model has no 
dependencies on aspects not recognized by the WMO within its standardization agenda. 
This is addressed by the plan to submit the model to the WMO-CHy for implementation 
into WIS and WIGOS, upon satisfactory results of testing.  

6.2.5 Implementation Neutrality 
Intended to be released to a community of sovereign WMO Member countries, no 
national data standard or proprietary technology for implementation should be directly 
referenced. Furthermore, existing standard implementations, industry or open, and 
implementations that are approved within the WMO standardization context are 
preferred. Implementation neutrality, i.e. no recommendation of a specific 
implementation or, particular technology, is fundamental to import new components in 
existing implementations.  

The use of ISO 19103 Conceptual Schema Language and Application Schema modeling 
idiom [7] is commonly expected as well as the provision of XML schema definitions of 
the individual model components. 

6.3 The Hydrology phenomenon and its abstract notion  

6.3.1 The Hydrology Phenomenon 
Hydrology is the science dealing with waters above, on and below the land surfaces of 
the Earth, their occurrence, circulation and distribution in time and space, their 
biological, chemical and physical properties, and their reaction with the environment [1].  
This definition applies to water in all of its phases moving from the atmosphere to the 
Earth and back to the atmosphere due to the processes forming the Water Cycle.  

The processes governing the continuous depletion and replenishment of water resources 
result at various stages in a wide range of hydrologic objects which are subject to 
monitoring, modeling and reporting in hydrology. Water from precipitation reaching the 
land surface is accumulated in water bodies occupying empty space on the land surface 
or in water bearing formations of soil and rock.  Due to continuous interaction with soil 
water and groundwater, a water body permanently gains or loses water.  

Water bodies interact with each other in basins wherein all incoming water is channeled 
towards a common outlet. Caused by gravity or by pumping water passes through soil 
and underground interstices, moves in open channels or closed conduits, or aquifers.  
The common outlet may be a particular location, but also a body of water. It may be a 
real place or a fictive one built from joining several locations. 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 9 
 

Water bodies may be aggregated into a hydrographic network using a connecting system 
of channels expressed in flow or drainage patterns.  This system of channels exists 
independently of whether water flows therein or not. It does not define whether a water 
body interacts with water bodies upstream and downstream. For example, normally 
stagnant waters may or may not be connected to streams during flood events, or streams 
may be interrupted to pools of stagnant water in periods of drought or not. Likewise, an 
aquifer system determines the potential connection between bodies of groundwater, but 
not causes the interaction.  

Water may be stored and managed in surface or underground reservoirs in terms of a 
resource for future use, for regulation and control. Conceptually, each water body, or the 
layers therein, may be managed as a reservoir.  Referring to the mass of water usually 
managed in particular layers, storage reservoirs are typically considered as stratified 
water bodies.  Also due to differences in thermal or salinity characteristics, or by oxygen 
or nutrient content a water body may be stratified vertically into distinct layers. 

Water bodies have individual names within common usage, but these may be variant in 
different cultural, political or historical contexts. In international programs and projects 
geographic names are usually fixed by convention. 

Water bodies are observed using monitoring stations and observing posts. Almost all 
stations are physical artifacts, or collections of these. Yet, some stations may be fictive 
ones. Monitoring stations may be connected logically in hydrometric networks which 
usually represent a distinct unit of monitoring or reporting at local or regional scale. It is 
common practice to locate a monitoring station with respect to local landmarks and 
permanent reference points, or in relation to the extent of the monitored water body. 

Water and water bodies are studied and reported in hydrologic „water“ units shared 
across disciplines and domains at national or international levels. Examples are the so-
called “River Basin Districts” of the European Water Framework Directive [8] 
designated not according to administrative or political boundaries, but rather according 
to the river basin as a natural hydrologic unit, or at national scale the “Hydrologic Unit 
Codes” (HUC) used by the US Geological Survey for the National Water Information 
System (NWIS) [9].

Figure 3 Processes of the Hydrologic Cycle 

6.3.2 The abstract notion: Catchment and Basin 
It is common practice in today’s environmental reporting to report the hydrologic 
processes and their results in a holistic approach at catchment scale. The catchment is the 
abstract notion of the hydrology phenomenon (Figure 3) commonly recognized across 
hydrologic disciplines and cross-domain. It is the shared unit of study usually addressed 
in inter-disciplinary programs, inter-program collaboration and cross-domain research 
projects, and also the management unit agreed across administrative jurisdictions and the 
unit of joint monitoring and reporting.  

A special type of catchment is the hydrologically determined basin. The term “basin” is 
used inconsistently in the literature, sometimes to denote an entire river system, 
sometimes a sub-basin or an inter-basin between key features such as major confluences 
in the river system. In terms of conformity to the WMO endorsed semantics, a definition 
is applied which refers to the physiographic unit wherein all incoming water is channeled 
to a common outlet.  

It is common practice to determine the position of the outlet in relation to a reference 
point. This reference point may be a permanent landmark, a station, or the point where 
groundwater enters the surface, but also a point projected onto the surface or created 
from collapsing individual points. For example, vertically arranged points may be 
aggregated and projected onto surface, the estuary of a stream may be logically 



OGC 11-039r3

aggregated to a point located at the mouth (Figure 4). The geometric representation 
varies with the application: it may be a point but also a curve or a surface.  

      

Figure 4 Many network nodes mapped to single logical node 

Basins are organized in hierarchies and related topologically in networks. They may be 
aggregated to complete river basins or to intermediate hydrologically discrete upper-level 
systems like management units. For example, generally recognized river basins are often 
partitioned in discrete sub-basins within a larger basin, with different approaches to 
aggregating up the lower level of hydrological detail. In terms of network connectivity, a 
basin gets inflow from a contributing upstream basin and flows out into a receiving basin 
downstream.  

Catchments and basins have inherent characteristics induced from interactions with other 
domains assigned in spatial, temporal or classification contexts. Almost all of these  are 
indicators of cross-domain applicability for example the geological region wherein the 
basin is situated, the shared space in an encompassing WMO Region, or a temporary 
reporting region.  

6.3.3 Multiple representations of catchment in the real world 
Depending on application and scale, the same catchment may be displayed in different 
ways. Reporting and analysis of landscape interactions refers typically to areas of study 
or its boundaries. A basin may be described geometrically e.g. by the bounding 
watershed, drainage area or streamlines, or topologically as a graph of nodes and links, a 
reporting region as member of a regional hierarchy. Some applications require 
cartographic representations while others are focused merely on topological relationships

(Figure 5). 

 

Figure 5 Cartographic representation vs. topology  

 

Cartographic representations without topology can still be partitioned using the boundary 
on the river-system scale, forcing a simple relationship between a trivial topology and 
the spatial representation of these coarse features (Figure 6). 

 

      

Figure 6 Alternative cartographic representations of a catchment / basin 

 

Cartographic representations do not always reflect the network connectivity of features 
explicitly. Even where connectivity is recorded (as opposed to unconnected lines) 
cartographic representations may be incomplete, as seen Figure 7. [10] This may be due 
to ephemeral nature of streams, land cover, underground connections or simply digitizing 



OGC 11-039r3

errors. Sometimes features may not be topologically connected, but represent the best 
available representation, another time the segmentation of features carries no semantic 
content in terms of representation or naming.

7.  HY_Features, conceptual model 

The HY_Features model describes the major components of the hydrosphere and their 
fundamental relationships according to the semantics expressed in definitions endorsed 
by the WMO.  It provides referencable concepts that may be addressed by applications 
reflecting a wide range of hydrologic features in different scientific disciplines in the 
hydrology domain and cross-domain. 

The model concept allows either the description of a logic hydrologic feature like the 
catchment, as often required in reporting applications, but also the identification of this 
ultimate hydrologic feature via its multiple real-world representations.  



OGC 11-039r3 

14 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

The conceptual model is expressed in the ISO 19103 Geographic Information 
Conceptual Schema Language [7] and ISO 19109 General Feature Model as a set of 
Application Schemas containing Feature Type definitions[11]). It is based on a broad 
industry standard, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) [12]. 

The model is developed in a multi-step process whereby the requirements for hydrologic 
referencing is reconciled with typical data set designs and semantics endorsed by the 
WMO-CHy. Module identification aims to simplify the scope of each part of the model 
in order to improve its accessibility and provide scope for testing. It is intended that each 
implemented data product needs to consider only those parts of the common model 
implicated by its scope. This is facilitated and made transparent by using only those 
modules that define concepts referenced by the data set. 

Differences in terminology may be explored through reconciling accepted definitions 
endorsed by the WMO-CHy and represented by the “UNESCO/WMO International 
Glossary of Hydrology” (IGH) [1], with the different aspects reflected in various data 
sets and products. It is intended to apply, wherever  appropriate, the terms from the IGH 
to the identified semantic constructs. This has the effect of augmenting the accepted 
definitions with explicit semantics for the relationships with other terminology.   

7.1 Basic concept 
A hydrologic feature is the abstract notion of the hydrology phenomenon. The core 
concept of HY_Features is that a study of the hydrology phenomenon will reflect 
common concepts of the real world by specific modeled features (as per ISO 19109 
General Feature Model). Depending on the scientific concern, the relevant hydrologic 
feature may represent different aspects of the hydrology phenomenon.  

Commonly recognized as the abstract unit of study and reporting in the hydrology 
domain, a catchment is considered as a hydrologic feature. Each catchment may be 
represented in any hydrologically meaningful sub-domain model, including by a simple 
tree network of „blue lines“, or the nested network of catchments. A catchment is 
multiple represented in the real world by a variety of hydrologic phenomena which are 
monitored, modeled and reported in typical applications.  Catchment area, catchment 
boundary, flowpath, hydrographic network, channel network, or hydrometric network are 
alternative views representing a catchment.  

The basin  is defined as the catchment special due to its hydrologic determination by the 
common outlet which may be an arbitrary location on, or projected onto, the Earth’s 
surface. A basin has by definition one single outflow node. It may have one single 
identified inflow node, which coincides with the outflow node of an upstream basin. The 
basic concept of a basin is that of a “link” between outflow nodes without knowing the 
complex hydrology between them. This concept requires a stable identifier that is not 
merely a function of an arbitrary delineation of the surface, and that basins are delineated 
within a simple hierarchy (tree structure).  



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 15 
 

Each basin may be nested in a containing basin in a simple “is-part-of” hierarchy as 
typically used for high order organization of management and reporting units. Each basin 
may be sub-basin of an all-encompassing basin, either as tributary basin without an 
identified inflow, or as inter-basin determined by inflow and outflow.   

By definition, the common outlet of a basin has no explicit location and no explicit 
geometry. A basin may be represented geometrically by an area (e.g. drainage area), a 
boundary polygon (e.g. watershed), or a curve (e.g. flowpath, or an indicative straight 
line). Since the geometry will vary with application, it needs to be defined there.  

7.2 Organization of the UML model 
The HY_Features model is a set of inter-related modules containing definitions for key 
aspects of hydrologic systems. The model is managed in sub-domain specific packages, 
allowing extension to the core set and involvement of relevant expert groups in the 
governance of individual models.  

The HY_ prefix follows the ISO naming conventions for UML elements. There is no 
explicit requirement that these names to be used in implementing systems for the same 
semantic elements. It is not yet specified how mappings between abstract element names 
and implementations should be recorded. Nevertheless it is expected that future 
interoperability will be facilitated by making such mappings available as a component of 
dataset documentation. 

NOTE:  The HY-prefix refers to the Greek “hydro” and means water in general because of “waters above 
and below the land surfaces of the Earth” (WMO 2010) is the principal object of study in hydrology.   

NOTE:  The EXT-prefix refers to “external”, common patterns that are required, but not hydrology-
specific, and should be imported when available from an external source. 

HY_Features model comprises the following packages: 

 HY_Utilities, containing utility classes for common patterns required by the domain 
model that are not hydrology-specific; 

 HY_HydroFeature,  incl. HY_Catchment, HY_HydrographicNetwork, 
HY_NamedFeature, HY_RiverPositioningSystem and HY_Storage; 

 HY_AtmosphericFeature; 

 HY_SubsurfaceHydroFeature, incl. HY_SubsurfaceWater and 
HY_SubsurfaceWaterConfines; 

 HY_SurfaceHydroFeature, incl. HY_SurfaceWater and HY_SurfaceWaterConfines; 

 HY_HydrometricNetwork. 

The organization into packages and their dependencies are shown in Figure 8.  



OGC 11-039r3 

16 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

 

Figure 8 HY_Features – Package dependencies 

7.3 HY_Utilities 
 
HY_Utilities package (Figure 9) contains utility classes for common patterns expected to 
be important for cross-domain harmonization. They should be provided in an external 
library for cross-domain usage. It is expected that future evolution of the ISO standards 
will provide a replacement for these components. At that point this package can be 
replaced with references to this library.  

These classes provide: 

 Cross-cultural name support (EXT_LocalisedName, 
EXT_MultilingualKeyword, EXT_TransliterationStandardCode, 
EXT_UsageType) 

 Context relationships, i.e. how different features may be related spatially, 
temporally or rank in a classification system (EXT_*Context)

7.4 HY_HydroFeature  
HY_HydroFeature schema (Figure 10) defines the fundamental properties and 
relationships between features governed by the physical laws of hydrology. It connects 
the disparate representations of the hydrologic feature in the real world, allowing the 
hydrosphere to be divided into a hierarchy of catchments.  



OGC 11-039r3 

18 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

 

Figure 10 HY_HydroFeature – Package dependencies 

 
HY_Catchment package defines a logical network of catchments. The catchment model 
is sufficient for the case of simplified hierarchies of catchments, particularly basins, 
without unnecessary detail of varying flow conditions and cartographic interpretation. It 
allows for the existence of basins to be recognized and identifiers assigned based on 
outflow nodes, even if stream networks, watershed boundaries and areas are not reliably 
determined.  It is intended that hydrological reporting applications may use this model 
without the full complexity of the HY_Features model.  

Figure 11 shows the hierarchy of Catchment and Basin allowing to address catchment or 
basin as part of a containing catchment, as well as a sub-basin (distinct from other sub-
basins) encapsulated an all-encompassing BasinAggregate, either as tributary basin or 
inter-basin connected with an upstream basin.

HY_Catchment defines the most common concepts of catchment representation including 
the formation of soil or rock with hydrologically significant characteristics 
(hydrogeologic unit). This allows the catchment concept to be referenced from a wide 
range of applications. If required, subtypes may be defined at the application level.  
Figure 12 shows the information model allowing the catchment to be represented 
differently in the real world.

The Outfall (Figure 13) is the topological concept which allows to consider an arbitrary 
location as the common outlet of a corresponding basin. Since the common outlet by 
definition has no explicit location and geometry, Outfall does not support a specific  
geometry attribute. For the Outfall to be positioned in the hydrographic network, a 
concept of IndirectPosition is introduced which provides a means to describe a position 
in relation to a ReferencePoint, either as the distance (length), or relative to as percentage 
of the total distance, or through verbal description of the spatial relationship.

Fixed by coordinates (related to the land surface via datum), the ReferencePoint itself is 
outfall of a corresponding basin in the network of basins. Defining typical reference 
points, such as fixedLandmark, crossSectionPoint, or extractionPoint, particular real-
world phenomena may be associated to the basin they represent.  The concept allows for 
the topological relationship between hydrometric stations to be established based on the 
positionOnRiver without detail of hydrography, hydraulic conditions, and cartographic 
interpretation.  

Figure 14 shows typical roles defined to support a semantic mapping with relevance to a 
water body (of at least one segment), the cross or longitudinal sections (of the channel 
network), or a well (extracting an aquifer). Further specific roles may be defined at the 
application level, if required.

HY_HydrographicNetwork package provides for the topological relationships to be 
declared between the major elements of the hydrosphere, including the segmentation of 
the hydrographic network into water bodies without imposing a particular network scale 
(Figure 15). It is defined in the context of a higher order identification of the network 
each element participates, hence the dependency on the abstract catchment model.  

HY_HydrographicNetwork introduces concepts of WaterBody and WaterBodySegments 
which may or may not be topologically connected at the representational level, as well as 
of the vertical partition into cross or longitudinal sections and the horizontal stratification 
into distinct layers. Liquid water (Water_LiquidPhase) may be accumulated in water 
bodies, ice (Water_SolidPhase) may be accumulated in glaciers, or cover a water body. 
Glacier is introduced here to provide a means to take the multiple relationships between 
glacier and water body into account at the application level. As glaciology is a science 
for its own, the relationships between glacier and water body are not in the scope of the  
HY_Features model, and need to be described in detail with implementation.

HY_NamedFeature package provides an abstract pattern shared by all hydrologic 
features where names are given to a feature, through common usage, without necessarily 
have a formal toponymy model. HydroFeatureName provides a model with to handle the 
issues of cultural, political and historical variability, HydroFeatureContext generally 
applicable characteristics assigned to the hydrologic feature in different spatial, temporal 
or classification contexts (Figure 16).

These named features are further elucidated in concrete feature types which specify the 
properties each representation uses to define one or more aspects of the hydrology of a 
feature. This includes related phenomena that participate in hydrologic systems but have 
specific characteristics. Given the complexity of the domain, and the nature of real world 
physical phenomena, for any given feature a wide range of possible characteristics, states 
and representations may be relevant.  

HY_RiverPositioningSystem (Figure 17) package provides a means to reference 
positions on a hydrographic feature via its topology and geometry.  The package 
introduces the concept of IndirectPosition where each location on the land surface may 
be described relative to, or as a distance to, a reference point located in the hydrographic 
network. The distance to the reference point is provided as Length, the relative position 
described as a percentage of the distance or using terms common in the hydrology 
domain such as “upstream”, “downstream”, “nearby”, etc..  

IndirectPosition requires a river mileage system whose origin is set at the position of the 
relevant point of interest, e.g. a water monitoring point, in the network. The coordinates 
are provided as distance upstream or downstream from this origin to the identified 
reference point. Since river mileage systems usually refer to a line (such as thalweg or 
stream centre line) assuming a horizontal curve, the river mileage system may use the 
one-dimensional CS_LinearCS of ISO 19111:Referencing by coordinates [4] . 
RiverMileageCS shall support at least one horizontal axis. The axis description should 
provide information about the direction (upstream, downstream) and the precision 
(smallest unit of axis division).

This concept supports basins to be related topologically and allows the hydrosphere to be 
divided into a network of basins (links between outfalls). Considering an arbitrary 
hydrometric station as Outfall of a basin, it may be located depending on its 
positionOnRiver without having local coordinates.  
 
HY_Storage (Figure 18) package provides an abstract pattern to describe a particular 
water body capable to store and yield water in terms of a resource for future use. This 
allows surface and subsurface reservoirs to be described independent of their 
representation within the hydrographic network, and hydrographic network elements 
without the details of storage capacities. Special types of reservoir may be defined with 
application.

7.5 HY_AtmosphericHydroFeature 
This application schema (Figure 19) defines concepts of the hydrology phenomenon 
above the Earth’s land surface without the complexity of a rainfall-runoff model.  

With respect to the hydrologic cycle, hydrometeors consisting of liquid or solid water 
particles falling through or suspended in the atmosphere are in the scope of the 
HY_Features model. Since water from precipitation is the main source of freshwater 
accumulated in water bodies, Hydrometeor is specialized into Precipitation consisting of 
liquid and solid water particles. Further specialization of is left to specific applications, 
as well as special concepts of water suspended in the atmosphere. 

The Precipitation concept (Figure 20) simply differentiates between the liquid and solid 
phase of water. This allows to separately address both water accumulated in water 
bodies, and ice accumulated in glaciers. It is intended that applications in surface water 
or glacier hydrology, particularly runoff modeling, may use the model to reference the 
represented hydrologic feature.

7.6 HY_SurfaceHydroFeature 
This application schema (Figure 21) defines concepts of the hydrology phenomenon on 
the Earth’s land surface with respect to water bodies aggregated in a hydrographic 
network using a connecting system of confining channels, but without complexity and 
detail of hydrologic and hydraulic models. 
 
 

       

Figure 21 HY_SurfaceHydroFeature – Package dependencies 

 

SurfaceWater (informative package) summarizes the most popular water bodies (mass of 
water) on the land surface each special by the property to permanently or temporarily 
move, by origin, by extent, by the phase of the contained water, or by their interaction 
with open sea. Depending on the implementation, each special type of hydrographic 
feature may be described by suitable attributes. 

SurfaceWaterConfines (Figure 22) package contains key elements confining a surface 
water body such as bed and banks of the watercourse. Depending on specific use cases, 
the channel (of at least one segment) through or along which water may move, may be 
associated with the hydrographic network of water bodies.

The SurfaceHydroFeature model allows to separately address the water body and the 
connecting watercourse, or parts of these. It is intended that applications in surface water 
hydrology, modeling hydraulics and morphology of streams use this model to reference 
the represented hydrologic feature.  
 

7.7 HY_SubsurfaceHydroFeature  
This application schema (Figure 23) defines concepts of the hydrology phenomenon 
below the Earth’s  land surface in respect to water accumulated in water bodies below 
the Earth's surface incl. their interaction with surface water bodies without the 
complexity of the groundwater or soil moisture models.

Figure 23 HY_SubsurfaceHydroFeature – Package dependencies 

SubsurfaceWater (informative package) summarizes the most popular types of liquid 
water occupying empty space in soil and aquifers. Depending on the implementation, the 
special types of subsurface water in the saturated and unsaturated zone may be described 
by suitable attributes. As hydrogeology is a science on its own, the special relationships 
between groundwater and a water body are not in the scope of HY_Features model. To 
take into account the effects of groundwater interaction on a gaining/losing water body (-
segment),  Groundwater may be associated with the relevant water body at the 
application level. 

SubsurfaceWaterConfines (Figure 24) includes the basic elements containing subsurface 
water such as a HydrogeologicUnit and Aquifer. Both are introduced here to provide a 
simple means for taking into account the hydrologically significant characteristics of 
geologic formations of soil or rock yielding water, particularly groundwater. Well is 
introduced to consider the well extracting water from aquifer as ReferencePoint that may 
be used to locate the Outfall of a basin.

Figure 24 UML class diagram: SubsurfaceWaterConfines 

The SubsurfaceHydroFeature model allows to separately address types of subsurface 
water as well as the containing aquifer without details of accumulation and movement of 
water. It is intended that applications dealing with groundwater and soil moisture may 
use this to reference the represented hydrologic feature.   
 

7.8 HY_HydrometricNetwork 
NOTE:  Not to be confused with the natural network of hydrographic features.  

NOTE:  Not to be confused with network sampling as distinct method of sampling. 

This application schema (Figure 25) defines a hydrometric network as an aggregate of 
hydrometric features which are logically connected, for example along a hydrographic 
feature. Hydrometric features may be physical artifacts, or a collection of these. Yet, 
some hydrometric features may be fictive ones. They may have localized names, typical 
properties and individual characteristics. In the observation context, the 
HydrometricFeature represents a sampling feature. 

The HydrometricFeature itself is free from any position. It is located in the hydrographic 
network using the concept of positionOnRiver which associates the hydrometric feature 
with a reference point which coincides with the Outfall of a corresponding basin 



OGC 11-039r3

mandatory positioned in relation to a reference point fixed by coordinates.  
 

 

      

Figure 25 HY_HydrometricNetwork – Package dependencies 

The HydrometricNetwork model allows to address a hydrometric network as a whole but 
also individual parts of this. Applications capturing the monitoring of hydrologic 
features, the observation and measurement of their properties may use this model to 
locate a WaterMonitoringPoint (as of WaterML2) [2] on the sampled hydrologic feature, 
as well as to reference the logic network of (fictive) hydrometric features representing 
the ultimate hydrologic feature like a catchment or basin. This is often required in the 
context of processing primary data, observed using real-world stations, into a new set of 
secondary data obtained using stations related to these. 

8. Discussion  

8.1 Compatibility of concepts 
NOTE:  Compatibility of concepts means that similar concepts are able to exist or perform together in 

combination without conflicts. 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 33 
 

The HY_Features model is intended to form the basis for standard practices for feature 
identification under the auspices of the WMO Commission for Hydrology (WMO-CHy). 
To achieve this goal, compatibility to similar concepts must be supported. HY_Features 
provides generally applicable concepts for reference, to which application-specific 
concepts may refer either by specialization or by mapping. 

8.1.1 Basin vs. DrainageBasin as of INSPIRE 
The INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community) 
Directive addresses the Hydrology issues in the data specification “D2.8.I.8: INSPIRE 
Data Specification on Hydrography“ v.3.0.1 [8] as the basic reference for use within the 
INSPIRE context.  This specification defines an abstract HydroObject covering all 
Physical Waters including the relation between DrainageBasin and SurfaceWaters 
(Figure 26).  DrainageBasin has  1..* outlets which are SurfaceWaters, and may contain 
sub-basins.  
 

 

Figure 26 INSPIRE Hydrography, v3.0.1 [13]– HydroObject 

NOTE:  SurfaceWaters refers to any physical body of water.  

NOTE:  DrainageBasin refers to the area having a common outlet for its surface runoff.  

This definition corresponds to the definition of BasinAggregate (in HY_Features), rather 
than Basin which is defined as a link between single inflow and outflow nodes. 
Therefore, for referencing BasinAggregate may be addressed, which aggregates (1..*) 



OGC 11-039r3 

34 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

subBasins each of them identified by an Outfall whose location may be a surface water 
body. 

8.1.2 Outfall vs. Contracted Node as of AHGF 
Australian Hydrological Geofabric (AHGF) [13] identifies important water features in 
the landscape as well as the connections between these features. Identifying persistent 
ContractedNodes that are points of hydrological significance that carry identity, the 
AHGF supports multiple representations of water features. Such a contracted node  may 
be the Outfalls of a basin as defined in the HY_Features model. 

The concepts of Catchment, BasinAggregate, Basin and Outfall of the HY_Features 
model have been implemented within the Geofabric as “HR_Catchments” (in terms of 
Catchment), as “Contracted Catchments” (in terms of BasinAggregate) and “AHGF 
Node” (in terms of Outfall). “Link” (in terms of Basin as a link) represents the 
topological connection between the catchment hierarchy.  

 

 

Figure 27 AHGF Hydrological Reporting Catchment 

A hierarchical set of catchments from individual stream segments to Contracted 
Catchments are defined in the SH_Network and HR_Catchments products with each 
catchment defined by a polygon shape draining to an outfall contracted node. Contracted 
Catchments are then aggregated to create stable Hydrology Reporting Regions, as shown 
for the Tasmanian Forth River Basin. 

 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 35 
 

8.1.3 IndirectPosition vs. NetworkPosition as of ISO19133 
IndirectPosition is introduced to describe the position of Outfall in the hydrographic 
network using a river mileage system as linear reference system (LRS). The underlying 
concept is that of a distance between two locations. One, which is the origin of the LRS, 
is the Outfall determined by its network position; the other is the (geometric) 
ReferencePoint fixed directly by coordinates. Since Outfall may be of any geometry, 
IndirectPosition  may address (via ReferencePoint) both the node or the link the position 
is on. IndirectPosition  associates a ReferencePoint, as a specific “marker” and the 
MileageSystem in sense of a  “link measure” (see also Figure 17) 

Even if navigation on watercourses is not in the scope of the HY_Features model, this 
similarity allows to address Outfall or ReferencePoint as start and stop positions of a 
Route as of ISO19133 [14]. 

 

8.1.4 HydrometricFeature vs. WaterMonitoringPoint as of WaterML2 
NOTE:  WaterMonitoringPoint is defined within WaterML 2.0 Part 1:Timeseries as (point) location 

where water flow or properties are reported, such as a stream gauge, rainfall gauge, or water quality 
monitoring site.  

Hydrologic observations make use of hydrometric stations as proxy to measure the 
characteristic properties of the ultimate object of study. WaterML2 [3] defines a 
WaterMonitoringPoint using the sampling features concept of ISO19156 [2].  Against 
this background, the description of sampling features is not in the scope of HY_Features. 

However, a HydrometricNetwork is introduced to provide a means to relate a logic 
network of (fictive) hydrometric stations to the catchment they represent, without the 
detail of the observation strategy, as usually required in the context of processing 
primary data from preceding observations into new data products. HydrometricFeature is 
introduced to provide a means to define a persistent identifier  positioned in the 
hydrographic network (see also 7.8). 

 

8.1.5 RiverML (under development) 
NOTE:  The development of a RiverML is under discussion in the framework of the WMO/OGC 

Hydrology DWG for exchanging river channel and floodplain geometry in a standardized way.  

Against the background of an evolving RiverML, the channel hydraulics and river 
morphology are not in the scope of HY_Features.  

However, Channel and ChannelSegment as well as RiverBed and Bank are introduced to 
provide a means to generally take into account the hydrologically significant hydraulic 
and morphological characteristics of conduits and open channels.  CrossSection and 
LongitudinalSection are introduced to provide a means to define a persistent identifier at 
longitudinal and transversal bed profiles (see also Figure 22) 



OGC 11-039r3 

36 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

 

8.1.6 GroundwaterML (under development) 
NOTE:  A groundwater interoperability experiment (GW2 IE) will develop and test the GroundWater 

Markup Language 2, by harmonizing and advancing existing modeling initiatives such as: GWML1, 
relevant EU-INSPIRE models (Geology, Hydrogeology, Environmental monitoring facilities), 
GeoSciML, and others. This IE is established in the framework of the WMO/OGC Hydrology DWG 
and will produce an engineering report for movement of the draft GWML2 specification to an OGC 
data standard.  

Against the background of the evolving GroundwaterML [15], the accumulation of 
groundwater as well as the interaction between surface water and groundwater are not in 
the scope of HY_Features. Bodies of groundwater, or parts of these, may be related to  
WaterBody, -Segment or –Stratum for reference, or in case of storage to (underground) 
Reservoir. 

However, HydrogeologicUnit is introduced to provide a means to generally take into 
account the hydrologically significant geologic characteristics of a formation of rock or 
soil representing a catchment.  VadoseWater, Groundwater, Aquifer and Well are 
introduced to provide a means to define a persistent identifier at the representation level 
for groundwater and soil water related features (see also Figure 24) 

 

8.1.7 Outfall vs. Pour point of ArcHydro GIS 
Outfall is defined under the premises that all waters in the basin are channeled to a 
common outlet. The same meaning is applied to the “eight-direction pour point” of 
ArcHydro GIS [16], defined to model the flow from a grid cell into the adjacent cell 
according to the flow paths. Consequently, the drainage lines, catchment and watersheds 
created using ArcHydro GIS are representations of a Basin in terms of HY_Features. 

. 

8.2 Hydrologic referencing and linked data 
Hydrologic features are the sampled features of observation, the allocated features in 
water use, the reported features at local or regional scales, and as such key criteria for 
discovery of hydrologic data and products. Even if the Feature is recognized as the 
abstract notion of a real-world phenomenon, different semantic concepts from different 
perspectives at different levels of detail are applied when modeling the hydrology 
phenomenon. It is expected that the HY_Features model will support the alignment of 
different perspectives on the shared hydrologic feature and the linkage of application-
specific concepts to hydrological features using standard patterns. 

The HY_Features model provides commonly agreed concepts of the fundamental 
relationships between the most important hydrologic features, particularly of the 
relations to the catchment they represent. It provides a concept of persistent identifier 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 37 
 

across multiple representations independent from application and scale.  Expressed in a 
platform-independent form, the model may be used as a basis for referencing hydrologic 
features that have persistent identity across multiple data systems. It is intended that 
applications in hydrology refer to the common concepts to relate specific features to the 
shared unit of study, management or reporting. Each concept may be specialized at the 
application-level for more detail, e.g. for groundwater, hydraulic or hydrometric features.  

Figure 28 shows the example of the Australian Hydrological Geofabric (AHGF) [13], a 
set of consistent spatial data products that are stored in GIS, where alternative 
representations are linked through a set of common 'contracted nodes'  persisted between 
representations, versions and scales of the Geofabric products. HY_Features is used to 
handle the semantics and to describe how 'contracted nodes' fit together. 

 

     

Figure 28 AU Hydrologic Geofabric - set of alternative representations 

 

Linking data across multiple systems, e.g. on the Web, means “linking references”. With 
respect to hydrologic data, topologic and hydrologic references are needed, rather than 
geometry. Identifiers must be able to stably reflect the hydrologic significance and 
network connectivity. Common semantics are required declaring these relationships. 



OGC 11-039r3 

38 Copyright © 2014 OGC  
 

Independent from specific application, scale and platform, HY_Features allows to realize 
the Linked Data principle: a hydrologic feature can be cross-referenced to a base concept 
and linked to a particular representation. For example, the name (URL) for a particular 
Basin may link to a resource (WFS) that provides information on what is known about 
the identified basin and “things” that relate to this (e.g. blue lines). This will support the 
development of common tools for discovery, access and sharing of hydrologic 
information. 

9. Further work 

9.1 XML Encoding 
 
The HY_Features model is specified using UML according to ISO 19103. This allows a 
GML Application Schema to be generated by following the encoding rules in ISO DIS 
19136 to assure conformity with GML requirements. 
 
HY_Features is not intended for direct implementation as a data product, but the features 
it defines may be used as inline references to hydrologic features to avoid introducing 
platform specific schemas for referenced features into independent data products.  

HY_Features classes may also be exposed from underlying data products using 
HY_Features to provide a well-known schema for hydrological features in distributed, 
federated contexts. 

The GML schemas for HY_Features are provided in a separate download as an annex to 
this document.  

 

9.2 OWL encoding 
HY_Features specifies how instances of hydrologic features may be associated. Such a 
model may be encoded using formal semantics. A draft encoding of HY_Features model 
using a set of standard encoding rules being developed under ISO 19150 has been 
created, and is available along with the XML schemas. 

A Feature Type Catalog service is being developed to provide a means to access the 
definitions of, and mappings between, conceptual models and multiple implementation 
models. It is intended to use this work to support validation and exploitation of the 
HY_Features model. 

 



OGC 11-039r3 

Copyright © 2014 OGC 39 
 

9.3 Validation 
The conceptual model should be validated through establishing mappings to application 
schemas and implementation models of data products realizing similar concepts. 
Mappings can be exercised and tested by delivering HY_Features instance data from 
data repositories holding data that can itself be mapped to alternative implementations. 

CSIRO is currently exploring using HY_Features to establish stable URL identifiers for 
features in the Australian Geofabric Data Products, and to link such identifiers to 
multiple representations of the concepts defined by HY_Features within different 
hydrologic data products, This work intends to use the relationships in HY_Features to 
characterize and associate related hydrologic features and establish a means to discover 
and access such data using the Linked Data principles.
