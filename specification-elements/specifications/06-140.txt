Introduction 

This document describes Feature Styling, that is mechanisms of software components 
that are capable to query, store and display symbology descriptions. It is based on the 
work described in 05-112 Symbology Management System that was created in the OWS-
3 initiative. 

The portrayal of feature and coverage data using XML-based encodings and OGC Web 
Services is an old subject in OGC. The first specification that addressed this issue in its 
entirety was the Styled Layer Descriptor Implementation Specification (SLD) (OGC 02-
070) that can be seen as an add-on to WMS 1.1.1. Those two specifications were linked 
in the sense that WMS 1.1.1 had defined some connection points to SLD. SLD 1.0.0 is 
very comprehensive, it encompasses: 

1. an XML based grammar for styling information 

2. an XML based language for map composition 

3. extensions for WMS operations to allow them to use SLD 

4. additional operations for legend creation and storage/retrieval of styling 
information. 

SLD was successful in its own right as there are a number of implementations of the 
specification now in the marketplace. There were a number of change requests for SLD 
1.0.0 that were the starting point of the development of a 1.1.0 version of SLD. Because 
of organisational issues the development of SLD 1.1.0 took longer than originally 
expected. 

During the OWS initiatives following the publication of SLD 1.0.0 a number of 
developments took place that were and are important for the development of SLD. One of 
these important developments was the specification of Catalogue Services to store 
portrayal rules and symbols. Another was the definition of the Feature Portrayal Service 
(FPS), an interface specialised on portraying feature data from WFS servers, using the 
mentioned Catalogue Services for retrieval of symbology and symbols. FPS though has 
so many characteristics in common with a component SLD-WMS as defined in SLD 
1.0.0 that it can be seen as a specialised component WMS. 

The use of portrayal registries based on OGC catalogue services motivated that the SLD 
specification was divided into two parts, one of them defining only the pure styling 
information (Symbology Encoding, OGC 05-077r4, see 1. above) and another part that 
allows WMS services to use Symbology Encoding in its service interface (SLD profile of 
WMS, OGC 05-078r2). 



OGC 06-140 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  vii
 

This document brings these developments together in a common conceptual model, 
taking into account the new ideas from the OWS initiatives while trying to retain as much 
backwards compatibility with SLD 1.0.0 as possible. 

The specific operations of FPS and integrated SLD-WMS are described in more detail in 
05-078r2 and its successor documents. The SLD profile of WMS again brings the ability 
to style features using extended GetMap requests and to create legends to the current 
WMS specification of version 1.3.

Feature Styling 

1 Scope 

Feature Styling is based on a distributed computational platform that employs a number 
of standard interfaces and encodings to allow for flexible, scalable and interoperable 
management of symbology (styles and symbols) in the process of producing maps from 
different kinds of data, most important being source GML data.

5  Feature Styling 

5.1 System context and the structure 

The structure of the a system for portrayal feature data is shown in the following figure: 

 

 

Figure 1 -- Relationship of FPS and Integrated SLD-WMS 

Two related services are able to portray feature data, these being the Feature Portrayal 
service and integrated SLD-WMS (for a more detailed explanation of these terms refer to 
OGC document 05-078r2). The following components are part of the overall system: 

Component SLD-WMS – a service for producing map images from feature and coverage 
data that is provided by WFS or WCS. Feature Portrayal Services and Coverage Portrayal 
Services are subclasses of component WMS, specialized on Feature or Coverage data. 

Feature Portrayal Service (FPS): a specialised component SLD-WMS able to portray 
GML data from WFS services.

Integrated SLD-WMS- An integrated SLD-WMS is a basic WMS that allows clients to 
apply Symbology Encoding to all or a subset of its layers. In addition to the WMS 
operations of GetCapabilities, GetMap and GetFeatureInfo, an integrated WMS has to 
support the DescribeLayer and DescribeFeatureType operations. It basically is a 
specialised WMS Service allowing Symbology Encoding to be applied to its internal data 
store. An integrated WMS only supports named layers (the layers it supplies in its 
GetCapabilities document). 

Web Feature Service (WFS) – a service for storing and retrieving GML feature data.. 
The role of the Web Feature Service is to serve as the data source in the context of a 
system for Feature Styling. Thus, its role in this context does not differ from a general 
purpose of WFS in Web-based scenario. Clients send the feature requests to WFS service 
instance and receive data (features) in GML form.  

However, it should be noted that the focus on portraying features (as opposed to other 
abstract data forms) is stronger in this initiative than in some previous ones, and 
subsequently the role of WFS is that much more significant. 

Catalog Service for Web (CS-W) – a cataloguing web service used in this context 
primarily for cataloguing symbol and style entities. It uses a specific ebRIM package for 
description of its information resources. Alternatively, the role of the CS-W can be 
fulfilled by a simple web server that supplies symbols and styles using URLs. 

The role of the Catalog Service for Web is to support registering, management, discovery 
and access Symbology Encoding style specifications. In addition, CS-W can store symbol 
libraries. The service is required to provide the following functionality in the context of 
Style Management: 

− Support for construction and publication of style type taxonomies  

− Ability to publish and find metadata about styles. 

− Ability to associate style instances to classification nodes in a style taxonomies  

− Ability to bind styles to feature types  

 

Additionally, the following elements are managed and processed: 

Style – a generic term for a description of styling attributes applied to a particular feature 
data in the portrayal process. This system (specifically, the WMS and FPS component) 
uses Symbology Encoding (SE) to encode the styles. 

Symbol – a generic graphical entity referenced in the styles and used by WMS/FPS in the 
styling process.

Feature – objects/phenomena on the Earth that are normally represented as graphical 
entities on a map (e.g., a house, political boundary, lake). The term GML Feature in 
addition implies that the feature and its properties are encoded using GML 

Styled Layer Descriptor - an XML grammar for map composition using Symbology 
Encoding (SE) to encode the styles.

Register Style 

User uses a client application to create a Symbology Encoding (SE) style for a particular 
feature type. The SE Editor client can be a visual style editor client  or a simple text or 
XML editor. 

The feature information required by the style, comes from capabilities and data schema 
obtained from WFS(s) or integrated WMS services. 

User uses a client application to send the SE document(s) to the CS-W that classifies 
them in its repository and makes them available for querying and retrieval.  

Find Style 

A user uses a client application to find a style (SE) in a CS-W instance or a simple web 
repository. Types of queries that can be submitted to the CS-W include queries by feature 
type, CS-W classification, assigned symbology standard (such as EMS or Geosym), and 
others. 

If only a simple web repository is used (a web server that supplies Symbology Encoding 
documents in a web-accessible directory) a suitable style can only be identified by 
browsing the XML documents and analyzing the description and FeatureTypeName 
elements. 

GetCapabilities 

User uses the client application to retrieve the capabilities information from the WMS in 
order to decide whether and how to use the service in the map creation process. The user 
can this way select a number of appropriate WMS services. 

The client application can, in the process of performing the GetMap (or some other) 
action, send the GetCapabilities request to the FPS service in order to obtain necessary 
information for the task. 

GetMap 

User uses the client application to construct a GetMap request and to send it to the WMS 
(FPS) service. The request includes information about the data source, styling reference 
and map properties (bounding box, size, etc). The service responds with the styled image 
of the data. 

The client can issue multiple requests, potentially to multiple WMS/FPS services, thus 
retrieving multiple map images which it composes into a single map. 

GetFeatureInfo 

User uses the client application to retrieve object information about portrayed features. 

 



OGC 06-140 

10 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

DescribeLayer 

An integrated SLD-WMSs only serves named layers and is not able to support arbitrary 
feauture types. A client application can therefore only apply styling information to 
available (“named”) layers. To do this, the client has to be able to find out about the 
feature types that compose the layer. The DescribeLayer-Operation supplies the names of 
the feature types pertaining to a layer that then can be used to issue a 
DescribeFeatureType request against the server. 

Get Capabilities 

A user uses a client application to query a WFS of his choice for the capabilities. This 
information is used to issue DescribeFeatureType requests. 

DescribeFeatureType 

A user uses a client application to query a WFS or integrated WMS of his choice for the 
data schema. These two information elements are used by the client for subsequent 
preparation of queries to CS-W and WMS/FPS. 

GetStyle 

WMS/FPS service interacts with the CS-W service to retrieve the style referenced in the 
GetMap request issued by the client. The style can be retrieved using the style id. It is 
assumed that the client performs the discovery and selection activities and supplies the 
FPS service with the direct reference (ID) of the style. 

Alternatively an SE can be stored flatly under a URL on the web and then be referenced 
by the GetMap request. Style and Symbol Provider is, in this context, an abstract term 
denoting any kind of agent against which a simple query can be made to retrieve a 
symbol. This can include File System, HTTP Web Server, other kinds of web services, 
etc.  

GetSymbol 

The symbol is referenced in the SE document using URI scheme and the CS-W or 
Symbol Provider must be able to accept such references and return appropriate result. 

GetFeature 

Component WMS/FPS service interacts with the WFS service to retrieve the data 
referenced in the GetPortrayal request issued by the client.

5.3 Sequence diagrams 

In the following the typical sequences for feature styling are described using UML 
notation. The sequences describe the registering of styles and the styling process itself 
using a FPS and an integrated SLD-WMS. 

5.3.1 Register Style 

The sequence diagram in the Figure 3 shows the RegisterStyle action activity. 

 

Figure 3 – Register Style sequence diagram

request and submits the GetFeature request to it. 

10. WFS returns the data (GML features) 

11. Retrieve style. FPS extracts the style reference from the request and submits the 
appropriate request to the CS-W.  

12. CS-W responds with the SE document 

13. FPS extracts the symbol references from the SE style. 

14. FPS makes the request to retrieve the referenced symbol 

15. FPS receives the symbol 

16. FPS portrays the features using the retrieved style and symbol 

17. FPS returns the image to the client. 

 

5.4 GetMap using integrated SLD-WMS 

The sequence for a GetMap operation using an integrated SLD-WMS is slightly different, 
as the SLD-WMS itself acts partly as a WFS.

5.5 Symbology Encoding documents and Symbols 

Symbology Encoding (SE) is an XML language for describing styling information that 
can be applied to digital Feature and Coverage data. 

The goal in designing Symbology Encoding was to isolate the feature style description 
from other information relevant to map creation. The scope of the SE encoding can be 
visually depicted as in the following diagram:

6 Outlook and future directions 

With Symbology Encoding and SLD-profile of WMS the missing link between SLD and 
WMS is again established. Publications of both documents as public standards is 
expected in the near future. As SLD-profile of WMS also defines the interfaces of 
Feature Portrayal Service and Coverage Portrayal Service, the need for a separate 
specification does not exist any more. 

Additional work for the future lies in a definition of a well-defined registry model for 
portrayal information and harmonization between SE/SLD and other OGC standards 
defining portrayal-related information e.g. Web Map Context or the default styling 
mechanism of GML. Another issue worth considering is the definition of conformance 
classes for Symbology Encoding, because its complexity (e.g. use of functions) results in 
the fact that almost no implementations of it will support all constructs defined and 
therefore interoperability is hard to achieve. Definition of a set of “basic” SE constructs 
(similar to GeoRSS or the Simple Feature profile of GML) might therefore be helpful.
