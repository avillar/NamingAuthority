Preface 

This document is a deliverable for the OGC Web Services 8 (OWS-8) testbed activity. 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate standards or revisions to existing standards into OGC's Standards Program, 
where they are formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, 
international teams of technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing 
interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC 
Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments 
and interoperability support services - all designed to encourage rapid development, 
testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards. 

The OWS-8 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommend to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-8 initiative be organized around 
the following threads: 

    * Observation Fusion 

    * Geosynchronization (Gsync) 

    * Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 

    * Aviation

3 EO-WCS 

The OGC® Web Coverage Service 2.0 Interface Standard - Earth Observation 
Application Profile (EO-WCS) defines a profile of WCS 2.0 [OGC 09-110r3] for use on 
Earth Observation data. An Application Profile bundles several specifications and 
possibly adds additional requirements on an implementation. Extra requirements can be 
additions (for example, Dataset Series and Stitched Mosaics are introduced by this 
specification) or constraints (for example, coverages offered are restricted to 2-D rasters).  

This Engineering Report describes progress on EO-WCS in the course of OWS-8. 

4 Specification changes 

The WCS.SWG currently discusses a corrigendum version 2.0.1 to WCS 2.0. Some of 
the corrigenda are needed for EO-WCS. 

In particular the addition of an <any> element to the <Contents> element of the 
GetCapabilities response as shown below is needed to report 
<DatasetSeriesSummary> elements: 

<any minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" processContents="lax" namespace="##other"/> 

The full definition of the <Contents> element reads as follows: 

<element name="Contents" type="wcs:ContentsType"> 
    <annotation> 
        <documentation>This element redefines the OWS Common [OGC 06-121r9] Contents 
section with a CoverageSummary, in accordance with the rules for modification laid down 
there. In addition it allows WCS extensions or application profiles to extend its 
content.</documentation> 
    </annotation> 
</element> 
<complexType name="ContentsType"> 
    <complexContent> 
        <extension base="ows:ContentsBaseType"> 
            <sequence> 
                <element ref="wcs:CoverageSummary" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> 
                <any minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" processContents="lax" 
namespace="##other"/> 
            </sequence> 
        </extension> 
    </complexContent> 
</complexType> 

Below an example of a XML instance is given: 

<wcs:Contents> 
    <wcs:CoverageSummary> 
        <wcs:CoverageId>someEOCoverage1</wcs:CoverageId> 
        <wcs:CoverageSubtype>RectifiedDataset</wcs:CoverageSubtype> 
    </wcs:CoverageSummary> 
    <wcseo:DatasetSeriesSummary> 
        <ows:WGS84BoundingBox> 
            <ows:LowerCorner>-180 -90</ows:LowerCorner> 
            <ows:UpperCorner>180 90</ows:UpperCorner> 
        </ows:WGS84BoundingBox> 
        <wcseo:DatasetSeriesId>someDatasetSeries</wcseo:DatasetSeriesId>

5 Adoption progress 

The specification document OGC 11-140 was reviewed by the OAB and the public RFC 
period was announced on July 21st 2011 and closed on August 20th 2011 without any 
comment submitted via the official means. Only some comments sent via e-mail on June 
17th 2011 will be considered by the WCS.SWG for the version released for voting and 
IPR period. The goal of the authors is to have the final version ready for SWG voting at 
the Boulder TC in September 2011. 

6 Implementation progress 

The EO-WCS specification is known to be currently implemented by at least two Open 
Source software tools namely EOxServer and GMU Earth Observation WCS v2.0. 

6.1 EOxServer 

EOxServer (http://eoxserver.org) is a server for Earth Observation (EO) data. EOxServer 
implements the OGC Implementation Specifications EO-WCS and EO-WMS on top of 
MapServer's1 WCS and WMS implementations. 

EOxServer is released under the EOxServer Open License a MIT-style license and is 
written in Python2 and entirely based on Open Source software including MapServer, 
Django3, GDAL4, SpatiaLite5, or PostGIS6, and PROJ.47. Prior versions up to 0.1.x are 
released under the GNU General Public License. 

The currently available functionality includes: 
� Support of GML AP – Coverages for RectifiedGridCoverages 
� Support of adopted WCS 2.0 specification (Core including GetCapabilities, 

DescribeCoverage, and GetCoverage requests, KVP-, and XML/POST protocol 
binding) 

� Anticipated support of envisaged extensions: Coverage format, GeoTIFF encoding, 
predefined (or EPSG) CRSs, scaling & interpolation, and non-referenced access.

By "anticipating" we mean to reflect the latest WCS.SWG discussions as well as to 
apply the relevant parts of the previous 1.1 and 1.0 versions of WCS. 

� Support of 2-D EO Coverages derived from gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage 
� Support of Dataset Series as a collection of EO Coverages e.g. in a time series 
� Support of new DescribeEOCoverageSet operation on Dataset Series and EO 

Coverages 
� Support of Stitched Mosaic of Rectified EO Coverages including concept of 

contributingFootprint 
� Support of EO Metadata (retrieval and evaluation in DescribeEOCoverageSet 

operation) 
� Protocoll bindings supported: 

o KVP 
o XML/POST (used together with SOAP2POST Proxy to support XML/SOAP 

protocol binding)  
� Coverage formats supported: 

o GeoTIFF 
o Formats supported by the GDAL library (support needs to be verified for 

each required format separately)  
� Support of EO-WMS for EO Coverages 

EOxServer packages can be downloaded from http://eoxserver.org/wiki/Download and 
the source code is available at http://eoxserver.org/browser or via any Subversion client 
from http://eoxserver.org/svn. The documentation is available at http://eoxserver.org/doc/ 
including a demonstration of the functionality at 
http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/users/demonstration.html. 

EOxServer is run in a community process lead by a project steering committee (see 
http://eoxserver.org/doc/en/rfc/rfc0.html). Discussions mostly take place on the dev 
mailing list http://eoxserver.org/mailman/listinfo/dev/. 

At the time of writing EOxServer is released in a stable 0.1 branch (latest version is 0.1.2, 
GPL license). Development is ongoing in trunk which will be released in a 0.2 (MIT 
license) branch and will include lots of enhancements and new features. The stable 0.1 
branch is the version tested against the CITE tests (see clause 7). 

In a joint code sprint, undertaken by EOX, rasdaman, and Jacobs University, an initiative 
has been started to use rasdaman as a pixel store instead of flat files. The resulting 
coupled system will be provided as a preconfigured VM for download. 

6.2 GMU Earth Observation WCS v2.0 

GMU EO-WCS is an OGC Web Coverage Service for Earth Observation data. GMU EO-
WCS implements the OGC WCS 2.0 Interface Standard – Core, and the WCS 2.0 
Application Profile – Earth Observation specifications.  



OGC 11-096 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 5 
 

GMU EO-WCS is released under the Open License a MIT-style license and is written in 
the C++ programming language, and entirely based on Open Source software including 
GDAL, PROJ.4 and HDF-EOS library.  

The currently available functionality includes: 
� Support of adopted WCS 2.0 specification (Core including GetCapabilities, 

DescribeCoverage, and GetCoverage requests, KVP-, and XML/POST protocol 
binding) 

� Anticipated support of envisaged extensions: Coverage format, GeoTIFF encoding, 
predefined (or EPSG) CRSs, scaling & interpolation, and non-referenced access. 
By "anticipating" we mean to reflect the latest WCS.SWG discussions as well as to 
follow the relevant parts of the previous 1.1 and 1.0 versions of WCS. 

� Support of Dataset Series as a collection of EO Coverages e.g. in a time series 
� Support of new DescribeEOCoverageSet operation on Dataser Series 
� Support of EO Metadata (retrieval and evaluation in DescribeEOCoverageSet 

operation) 
� Protocol bindings supported: 

o KVP/GET 
o XML/POST  

� Coverage formats supported: 
o GeoTIFF (image/tiff) 
o NetCDF (application/x-netcdf) 
o HDF-EOS (application/x-hdfeos) 
o JPEG2000 (image/jpeg2000) 
o Raster formats supported by the GDAL library  

GMU EO-WCS source code can be downloaded from 
http://geobrain.laits.gmu.edu/ows8/wcseo/code/gmu_eowcs_v0.1.tar.gz. The 
documentation is available at http://geobrain.laits.gmu.edu/ows8/wcseo/doc/, and a 
demonstration of the functionality at 
http://geobrain.laits.gmu.edu/ows8/wcseo/demo/wcseodemo.html. 

6.3 Limiting result size 

In order to prevent the server hardware hosting an EO-WCS service from being blocked 
by single requests the EOxServer currently applies a limitation on the number of pixels 
per axis for resulting coverages. This limitation defaults to 2048 pixels for each axis. 
However, this is maybe not the most appropriate solution especially because it is not 
standardized but also because it doesn't take into account the rangeType of the coverage. 

Thus it is proposed to standardize a limitation possibility in a WCS extension that can be 
used by service instances based on the rangeType, which means a limitation of the size of 
the rangeSet. 

EO-WCSs serve only 2 dimensional sub-types of GridCoverages. Thus the exact number 
of pixels (grid points) of a GetCoverage result is known a priori. Multiplied by the 
number of bands (elements of the rangeType) and the amount of bits each pixel value 
needs (e.g. 8 for byte, 16 for int16, etc.) this results in the exact number for the size of the 



OGC 11-096 

6 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

rangeSet. Of course different encodings and compression techniques may significantly 
reduce this number but it is perfectly suited for a specification on service protocol level. 

The server should include such a limitation in the GetCapabilities response in a similar 
way to the limitation of the number of CoverageDescriptions returned in a 
DescribeEOCoverageSet response. This can be taken into account by a client requesting, 
with some basic calculations, only small enough subsets via GetCoverage operations. 

7 Conformance testing 

7.1 EOxServer 

Conformance testing of the EOxServer is done using the stable 0.1 branch. Currently the 
two OWS-8 demonstration service endpoints (see clause 8) pass all tests up to the test 
named "wcseo:req46" which happens to be the first one testing an exception. 

The current CITE tests run into a problem with the TEAM engine whenever a response 
reports a HTTP status codes different than 200. However, this behavior is required by 
OWS Common 2.0, OGC 06-121r9 section 8.6 "HTTP STATUS codes for OGC 
Exceptions" which is used by WCS 2.0 and thus EO-WCS. For example the request: 
http://ows.eox.at/cci/ows?service=WCS&VERSION=2.0.0&request=DescribeEOCovera
geSet responds with the following: 

Headers: 

HTTP/1.1 400 BAD REQUEST

For more details see this e-mail thread on the CITE forum mailing list: 
http://lists.opengeospatial.org/pipermail/cite-forum/2011-August/000594.html 

8 Demonstration 

A demonstration of the EO-WCS functionality is available at the two service endpoints 
http://ows.eox.at/cci/ows? and http://ows.eox.at/ofc/ows?. A summary of the available 
data and some sample requests can be found at http://ows.eox.at. Note that these

demonstration services serve data for the OWS-8 demonstration scenarios namely the 
"Monterey Earthquake emergency response scenario" in the Cross-Community 
Interoperability (CCI) thread and the "Amazon Drought analysis" scenario in the 
Observation Fusion – Coverages (OFC) sub-thread.
