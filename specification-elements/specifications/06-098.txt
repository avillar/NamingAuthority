1. Introduction 
Version 1.0 of the Web Coverage Service (WCS) Specification does not address how coverage data gets 
added to or deleted from a server; it is assumed that some implementation-specific process exists for 
handling this, likely on the back end (server-side).  One of the goals of OWS-4 was to extend WCS to 
support these operations, generally referred to as “WCS-T”. 
Early on in the OWS-4 process, however, the WSC RWG independently produced a Change Request 
targeted against the WCS 1.1 effort for the addition of a “harvest” operation.  This change (document 06-
043, by Arliss Whiteside) initially described how a client could pass a server a coverage description and a 
URL pointing to some coverage data.  It did not originally consider the other operations or address adding 
coverage data directly, performing update operations, or deleting data. 
As a result of the OWS-4 project, the 06-043 document has evolved to incorporate the larger WCS-T goals 
under WCS version 1.1.  (Earlier drafts of this document discussed ‘043 and the changes required.) 
Due to time constraints, LizardTech’s implementation is not able to support the full 06-043 specification.  
Instead, we have chosen to implement a subset of the 06-043 functionality under WCS 1.0, as a proof of 
concept.  This document gives the specification for this WCS 1.0 implementation; it also provides some 
discussion of certain general WCS-T issues.

OpenGIS Project Document 06-098 8/13/2007 Page 2 



Changes to GetCoverage: 

• (none) 
Addition of AddCoverage. 
Addition of UpdateCoverageMetadata. 
Addition of ReplaceCoverage. 
Addition of DeleteCoverage. 

2.2 GetCapabilities Changes 
2.2.1 Addition of New Request Operations 
Four new capabilities request types are added (change to WCS 1.0, section 7.3.3.7): 

• AddCoverage 

• UpdateCoverageMetadata 

• UpdateCoverage 

• DeleteCoverage 

Note that these four operations are independent of each other; for example, a server may support coverage 
replacement and metadata updates, but not support coverage addition or deletion. 

2.2.2 Addition of SupportedInputFormats 
The WCS-T server shall specify the input formats it supports for the AddCoverage transaction request.  
In the Capabilities document, SupportedInputFormats will be located in WCS_Capabilities / 
Capability, parallel to the Request element.  It will contain any number of inputFormat elements, 
one for each format the server supports. 
Implementation Note: The LizardTech WCS-T server does not provide a list of supported input formats.  
It supports the following formats: 

image/jp2;subtype="gmljp2" 
image/jp2 

2.2.3 Addition of SupportedInputCRSs 
The WCS-T server shall specify the input CRSs it supports for the AddCoverage transaction request.  In 
the Capabilities document, SupportedInputCRS will be located in WCS_Capabilities / 
Capability, parallel to the Request element.  It will contain any number of inputCRS elements, 
one for each format the server supports 
Implementation Note: The LizardTech WCS-T server does not provide a list of supported input CRSs.  It 
will support any CRS given. 

2.3 DescribeCoverage Changes 
This work entails no changes to the DescribeCoverage request or response. 

2.4 GetCoverage Changes 
This work entails no changes to the GetCoverage request or response. 

OpenGIS Project Document 06-098 8/13/2007 Page 3 



2.5 AddCoverage Addition 
This operation corresponds to the “Add” operation in 06-043. 
The AddCoverage operation supports these parameters: 

• InputFormat – file format of input coverage (optional) 

• InputCRS – CRS of input coverage (optional) 

• InputMetadataURL – location of input coverage metadata (optional) 

• InputDataURL – location of input coverage data (optional) 
Either HTTP GET or HTTP POST may be used.  For POST, enctype=”multitype/form-data” 
should be used. 
If the URL parameters are used, POST is not necessary.  If POST is used, the labels InputDataBody 
and InputMetadataBody may be used to identify the corresponding data sections. 
The input format and CRS must be in the list of supported input formats and CRSs.  If either of these two 
optional parameters is not specified, the values will be inferred from the file’s contents. 
The InputMetadataURL points to a location providing metadata for the coverage. 
The response to an AddCoverage request will be the coverage description, or an appropriate error signal 
if the add operation fails for some reason, e.g. the file format is not supported. 
Implementation Note: LizardTech’s WCS-T server ignores the InputMetadataURL value if it is 
supplied. 
Implementation Note: LizardTech’s WCS-T server does not support coverages made up of multiple image 
files. 

2.6 UpdateCoverageMetadata Addition 
This operation corresponds to the “Update” operation in 06-043. 
The UpdateCoverageMetadata operation supports these parameters: 

• Coverage – the ID of the coverage to be updated (required) 

• InputMetadataURL – location of input coverage metadata (optional) 
Either HTTP GET or HTTP POST may used.  For POST, enctype=”multitype/form-data” 
should be used. 
The coverage ID must be a valid ID for the server. 
The response should be an acknowledgement of success, or else an appropriate error signal if the update 
operation fails for some reason, e.g. the coverage ID is not valid. 
Implementation Note: LizardTech’s WCS-T server does not support this operation. 

2.7 UpdateCoverage Addition 
This operation corresponds to the “Update” operation in 06-043. 
The UpdateCoverage operation supports these parameters: 

• Coverage – the ID of the coverage to be updated (required) 

• InputMetadataURL – location of input coverage metadata (optional) 
Either HTTP GET or HTTP POST may used.  For POST, enctype=”multitype/form-data” 
should be used. 
The coverage ID must be a valid ID for the server. 

OpenGIS Project Document 06-098 8/13/2007 Page 4 



The response should be an acknowledgement of success, or else an appropriate error signal if the update 
operation fails for some reason, e.g. the coverage ID is not valid. 
Implementation Note:  In the LizardTech WCS-T implementation, the operation is named 
ReplaceCoverage instead of UpdateCoverage. 
Implementation Note:  In the LizardTech WCS-T implementation, the coverage ID parameter is named 
CoverageID instead of Coverage.  
Implementation Note:  In the LizardTech WCS-T implementation, the new coverage data must match the 
old coverage data with respect to such properties as width and height, colorspace, bit-depth, etc. 

2.8 DeleteCoverage Addition 
This operation corresponds to the “Delete” operation in 06-043. 
The DeleteCoverage operation supports these parameters: 

• CoverageID – the ID of the coverage to be removed (required) 
Either HTTP GET or HTTP POST may used.  For POST, enctype=”multitype/form-data” 
should be used. 
The coverage ID must be a valid ID for the server. 
The response should be an acknowledgement of success, or else an appropriate error signal if the update 
operation fails for some reason, e.g. the coverage ID is not valid. 

3. Discussion 

3.1 Security and Authentication 
WCS-T makes no restrictions with respect to security or authentication of clients modifying the server’s 
coverage offerings.  Such control is left to other OWS mechanisms (as is the case for WFS-T). 

3.2 “Coverage-Based” vs. “Region-Based” Semantics 
The extensions in this proposal operate on entire coverage offerings, as opposed to regions within a 
coverage.  That is, only an entire coverage layer may be added or deleted; no support is given for 
modifying or updating a subset of an existing coverage. 
In the future, however, it is likely we will want to be able to perform transactions on subsets of a coverage.  
If so, several issues will need to be addressed: 

• Not all file formats used by storage on the back end are readily amenable to updating, e.g. 
compressed JP2 images.  It would be useful for the server to be able to indicate via the capabilities 
document or a coverage description whether a given coverage is updatable by region. 

• The incoming data must be of the same type and format as the existing data, e.g. bit depth, number 
of bands, etc. 

• The incoming data must match the existing data with respect to its coordinate reference system, 
etc. 

• What should the behavior be if you delete part of the interior of a coverage?  For example, would a 
newly-created “hole” appear as a no-data region?  Similarly, what happens if you add coverage 
data such that the geographic origin or bounding box is changed? 

3.3 “Update” for “Versioning” 
It is likely that some workflows will require using the Update operation as a mechanism for “versioning” 
the file.  For example, the concept of coverage IDs could be extended to include version numbers; an 

OpenGIS Project Document 06-098 8/13/2007 Page 5 



update would then really be just an AddCoverage of a new version.  However, this is likely to require 
better understanding of expected workflows and would in any case have a significant impact on WCS in 
general; versioning is out of scope for WCS-T.  Guidance should be taken from prior art in other W*S 
specifications. 

3.4 Separation of Add and Update 
Add and Update are treated as distinct operations within the Capabilities document.  This allows a server 
to support only insertions and not updates, or vice versa, depending on implementation issues or security 
concerns. 

3.5 Lack of Support for Nongeoreferenced Images 
It was requested that attention be paid to the question of nongeoreferenced images.  We did not do so, 
however, as WCS 1.0 does not support coverages that are not georeferenced; WCS 1.1 will.  (There is also 
no support for this in GMLJP2 1.0, although the RWG is aware of the issue.) 

3.6 Atomicity and Locking  
The atomic nature of the “transaction” should be explicitly addressed in a subsequent version of this 
proposal.  Specifically, where there is more than one operation requested, if any operation fails then none 
of the others are to be committed.  (This proposal only allows for one operation per request.) 
If providing such commit-or-rollback semantics is not going to be feasible for some server 
implementations, it may be desirable to provide a mechanism for a server to indicate that it does not 
support these semantics, and/or provide a client-side mechanism for indicating that a sequence need not be 
performed atomically. 
We also do not support locking in this proposal.  Subsequent work involving support for multiple 
operations per single transaction, or for region-based semantics, might require locking semantics.  We 
would expect using an approach similar to that supported by WFS.
