Preface 

This document contains a data content specification for Local Mission Specific Data 

(MSD) and is based on the GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile (GSIP) developed 

by the NGA. This document defines the GML 3.2.1 (ISO 19136) encoding requirements 

for Local MSD. The structure of the document is based on ISO 19131 (Geographic 

Information – Data Product Specification). 

The Local Mission Specific Data Data Content Specification (DCS) was developed as 

part of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Interoperability Program. 

OGC employs a variety of innovative techniques to enable developers and integrators to 

rapidly and efficiently test, validate, and document specifications based on user 

requirements. One technique that is part of the Interoperability Program is the Open Web 

Services (OWS) Testbed. This document was developed as part of the testing, evaluation 

and implementation process, within the OWS phases 4 and 5 (OWS-4, OWS-5), designed 

to evaluate the encoding of MSD in Geography Markup Language (GML) as well as test 

the use of MSD within a web services architecture.  

Suggested additions, changes, and comments on this draft report are welcome and 

encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message or by making 

suggested changes in an edited copy of this document. 

The changes made in this document version, relative to the previous version, are tracked 

by Microsoft Word, and can be viewed if desired. If you choose to submit suggested

4.3  

Mission Specific Data (MSD)  

MSD provides the required geospatial detail (at the needed density/resolution and 

accuracy) and features and/or attributes to meet specialized mission needs. MSD can be 

of many types – to include elevation data, imagery, or vector features. 

4.4  

Global Mission Specific Data (Global MSD) 

Low density global coverage of essential features used for strategic planning and 

monitoring. This data is the underlying layer of feature data that will be intensified into 

mission specific data. Global data depicts only the general character of the terrain and 

features of considerable prominence. These features change rarely or slowly. Global 

information supports initial planning level and reference data views. 

4.5  

Regional Mission Specific Data (Regional MSD)  

Medium density regional coverage used for operational planning to meet mission 

requirements. Regional Mission Specific Data will have the same geometry as Local 

Mission Specific Data, but different (less) content. It is responsiveness data which is 

mission dependent and requirements driven. These features change rarely or slowly and 
include lines of communication consisting of transportation networks (road, railway, 

pipeline, air and waterway), communications networks and power distribution networks. 

4.6  

Local Mission Specific Data (Local MSD)  

High density local coverage of focused areas used to meet specific geospatial 

requirements. Local MSD has more densification and greater detail than regional data 

(more feature classes, attributes, and attribute values). It is responsiveness data, which 

has mission dependent requirements and is usually time-sensitive. It is generally used for 

planning and operations of a tactical nature. The level of detail is sufficient for infantry 

and reconnaissance units to navigate in various environments. 

4.7  

Specialized Mission Specific Data – Urban (Specialized MSD – Urban)  

Very high density local coverage of focused areas used to meet specific geospatial 

requirements. Used for special operations and disaster relief. Urban data encompasses 

greater detail (density, accuracy, and resolution), or additional features and/or attributes 

to meet greater operation requirements. It is a responsiveness data, which is mission 

dependent, requirements-driven, and usually time-sensitive. 

4.8  

National System for Geospatial Intelligence Entity Catalog (NEC) 

The National System for Geospatial Intelligence Entity Catalog (NEC) is a collection of 

GEOINT data requirements as determined by NSG partners. The NEC serves as the 

Logical Data Model (LDM) from which specific data content can be physically 

implemented. The data content outlined in Mission Specific Data conforms to the latest 

version of the NEC.

4.9  

GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile (GSIP) 

Defines the methods for identifying and encoding Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) data 

in the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). The GSIP integrates the 

conceptual schemas from the ISO/TC 211 19100 series of standards for modeling. The 

GSIP also draws on the relevant content standards, specifications and profiles from the 

Digital Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG), International Hydrographic 

Organization (IHO), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as well as others 

with the intent to unify multiple domain-specific content models.

6 Overview  

Mission Specific Data (MSD) provides the required geospatial detail (at the needed 

density/resolution and accuracy) and features and/or attributes to meet specialized 

mission needs. MSD can be of many types – to include elevation data, imagery, or vector 

features. 



OGC 08-077

Local Mission Specific Data (Local MSD) is extracted to support high-density local 

coverage of focused areas used to meet specific geospatial requirements. Local MSD has 

more densification and greater detail than regional data (more feature classes, attributes, 

and attribute values). It is responsiveness data, which has mission dependent 

requirements and is usually time-sensitive. It is generally used for planning and 

operations of a tactical nature. The level of detail is sufficient for infantry and 

reconnaissance units to navigate in various environments. 

Local MSD is equivalent in data content to what was formerly known as MSD3. It is 

equivalent to the content of 1:50K and 1:100K products including Harbor / Approach / 

Coastal Charts. While the scale and content correlates to current Topographic Line Map 

(TLM) products, they are not a one-for-one match. Local MSD will utilize data from 

existing NGA data stores. Local MSD contains three themes that consist of aeronautical 

data pulled from the Aeronautical Digital Data Environment (ADDE); topographic data 

pulled from the Geospatial Intelligence Feature Database (GIFD); hydrographic data 

pulled from Digital Navigation Chart (DNC) products. All three are compiled separately, 

then de-conflated, and merged. 

The exact feature, attribute and geometry requirements for a Local MSD extraction are 

mission specific. However, the framework for all MSD levels is defined as part of the 

National System for Geospatial-Intelligence Application Schema (NAS) version 2.5 

(draft). The data stores used as source for data collection do not represent the latest 

version of the NAS that defines Local MSD therefore mapping tables are created to 

transform existing data structures to NAS-compliant data. 

Local MSD is not to be used for navigation purposes, but supports navigation, mission 

planning, initial preparation of the battlefield (IPB), etc. 

7 Formal data product specification 

7.1 General remark 

This clause contains a description of the Local MSD Data Content Specification based on 

the formal structure of ISO 19131. 

7.2 Specification scope 

In principle, a data content specification may not be homogeneous across the whole data 

content, but may vary for different parts of the data. Given that Local MSD extraction is a 

user driven requirement not all Local MSD data collections will contain exactly the same 

features, and/or attributes. For Local MSD, however, the same specification scope applies 

to all parts of the data content specification that are described in the subsequent sub-

clauses.

7.4 Data content and structure 

Local MSD is a feature-based product. Content information is described in terms of an 

application schema, an entity catalog and a feature concept dictionary.  

An overview of the Local MSD feature types, their properties (attributes and association 

roles) and their grouping into packages is included as Annex A. 

The process of creating the application schema and feature catalog consists of the 

following steps which are described in detail in the document “GSIP Schema Processing 

ER (OGC 08-078)”: 

- Local MSD is a subset of the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence Application 

Schema (NAS).  

- The content of the NAS plus information which subset of the NAS belongs to Local 

MSD (or other data content specifications) as well as other relevant information is 

represented in the NEC. 

- A script developed by NGA is used to automatically create the NAS as a ISO 19109 
Application Schema in UML from the NEC. The UML model is a Rational Rose or 

Eclipse model. 



OGC 08-077 

Copyright © 2008 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 9 
 

- The UML model is exported from Rational Rose as a XMI 1.0 file (XMI provides a 
vendor independent XML encoding of a UML model). 

- Using the open source ShapeChange tool (http://www.interactive-
instruments.de/ShapeChange/) for UML-to-GML-Application-Schema conversions 

(UGAS), a GML 3.2.1 application schema of the NAS is derived automatically from 

the XMI file. The tool documentation includes one document describing the mapping 

rules from UML to GML application schemas as implemented by the tool. A second 

document describes the implementation of the ShapeChange tool, its installation and 

guidelines for using the tool. 

Application schema The application schema provides the formal description of 

the data structure and content. It is a conceptual model, 

described using UML as the conceptual schema language in 

accordance with ISO 19109 (Geographic information — 

Rules for Application Schemas) and ISO/TS 19103 

(Geographic information — Conceptual Schema Language). 

 

The NAS application schema can be obtained as a Rational 

Rose UML model at the URL of the GEOINT Structure 

Implementation Profile (GSIP), see clause 4. 

 

Only a subset of the full NAS is part of Local MSD. The 

constraints imposed by Local MSD on the full NAS are 

documented in Annex A. 

 

Entity catalog The entity catalog provides the semantics of all feature and 

other information entity types, together with their attributes 

and attribute value domains and association types between 

entity types contained in the application schema. The entity 

catalog is realized in accordance with ISO 19110 

(Geographic information — Methodology for feature 

cataloguing) and is encoded as a Microsoft Excel 

Workbook. All information entity types are treated as feature 

types in the catalog. 

 

The feature types, attribute types and attribute value domains 

are derived from the NSG Feature Data Dictionary (NFDD). 

The NFDD is based on the DGIWG Feature Data Dictionary 

(DFDD) with some national extensions. 

The Local MSD feature catalogue can be obtained as an 

Excel workbook at the URL of the GEOINT Structure 

Implementation Profile (GSIP), see clause 4.  
 

A tabular overview of the Local MSD entity types and their 

properties is included as Annex A. 



OGC 08-077 

10 Copyright © 2008 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

 

GSIP also provides a loose grouping mechanism, called “Views”. There are currently 

about 100 views defined that are related to Local MSD. Information entities, in particular 

feature types, are associated with one or more views, and those views are organized into 

groups. Entity views are provided as a means to organize subsets of the NAS for the 

purposes of inspecting "similar entities". 

Views are also encoded as DDMS metadata elements which can be registered and 

published in a registry. This allows clients to discover them and use them, for example, to 

create queries of all features that are part of that view. 

NOTE Views are NOT "coverages" in the sense of coverages in existing FACC based data product 
specifications and do not in any manner affect the content of the NSG FC. 

The views are listed in Annex B.  

7.5 Reference systems  

Reference systems used in Local MSD data provide a reference frame for spatial and 

temporal coordinate values. 

Spatial reference system The use of WGS84 geographic coordinates for horizontal 

coordinates and Mean Sea Level (MSL) for vertical 

coordinates is mandated. 

Temporal reference system Gregorian calendar 

 

For attribute values that are associated with a unit of measure, the unit of measure is 

specified in the documentation of the respective attribute.  

7.6 Data quality  

Local MSD datasets have to meet the data quality requirements as described in this 

subclause. The data quality requirements for the three “themes” of data source that make 

up Local MSD, aeronautical, topographic and hydrographic are defined and verified 

during the data collection phase of these three individual themes. These requirements are 

defined by the respective production elements. The data quality requirements for Local 

MSD following the data deconfliction and merging are described in accordance with ISO 

19113 (Geographic information - Quality principles) and include a statement on 

acceptable conformance quality levels defined by the mission specific user requirements. 

The data conformance to these mission specific quality requirements will be reported 

based on adherance to the data quality measures as defined in ISO 19114 (Geographic 

information — Quality evaluation procedures) and ISO/TS 19138 (Geographic 

information - Data quality measures). 

 



OGC 08-077 

Copyright © 2008 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 11 
 

Metadata reporting of data quality for Local MSD will be done in accordance with the 

ISO documents described above. Reporting will be done for only those data quality 

measures where measurements are actually completed and will be based on the user-

defined set of quality requirements for the mission specific extraction. This DCS does not 

attempt to define the acceptable values for data quality, but rather defines the mechanism 

for reporting the results. 

A formal definition of data quality information is given in ISO 19131 Annex E.4, which 

provides a UML model and the corresponding data definitions. 

An absolute horizontal positional accuracy for Local MSD feature data has been 

established as 23 Meters Circular Error. No linear positional accuracy requirement has 

been predefined for Local MSD. However, user defined requirements may identify an 

alternative acceptable positional accuracy. Local MSD extractions will report on the 

positional accuracy of the feature data in conformance with ISO 19115 metadata and 

measured in conformance with ISO/TS 19138 data quality measures. 

Regional MSD requirements include the ability to support network analysis. Local MSD 

being a densification of a Regional MSD is therefore expected to also support network 

analysis. Given this requirement an evaluation of the data content to support topology is 

necessary. ISO 19138 Data Quality Measures provides guidelines on topological 

consitency measures, examples 1 and 2 below describe measures to evaluate connectivity 

requirements.

While no absolute horizontal or linear positional accuracy requirement has been 

predefined for Local MSD, user defined requirements will likely identify a minimum 

acceptable positional accuracy.  However, Local MSD extractions will report on the 

positional accuaracy of the data regardless of an established requirement. Reporting of 

positional accuracy will be in conformance with ISO 19115 metadata and measured in 

conformance with ISO/TS 19138 data quality measures.

7.7 Data capture  

Local MSD will utilize data from existing NGA data stores. Local MSD contains three 

themes that consist of aeronautical data pulled from the Aeronautical Digital Data 

Environment (ADDE); topographic data pulled from the Geospatial-Intelligence Feature 

Database (GIFD); hydrographic data pulled from Digital Navigation Chart (DNC) 

products. All three are compiled separately, then deconflated, and merged. 

Local MSD will then be densified to meet specific user-defined geospatial requirements. 

Rules for densified data capture for extraction are defined in the Topographic Feature 

Extraction Guide for Regional and Local Data (TFEG-RL). The primary purpose for 

developing the TFEG-RL is to provide a logical approach to extraction that will support 

collection of digital data and population of a product-neutral digital database. The 

guidance document is intended to standardize the feature extraction process, promote a 

consistent approach to data collection for NGA and NGA digital data producers and 

reduce "clutter" as a result of over-collection. 

NOTE The NAS profile covered by the TFEG-RL differs from the Local MSD profile. 

 

7.8 Data maintenance  

There is no predescribed maintenance cycle identified for mission specific data. 

However, the NGA Foundation-Based Operations Strategic Implementation Plan which 

provides an assessment of NGA’s ability to enable GEOINT by reviewing the key 

enablers of technology, metrics, corporate communication, governance, processes, 

standards, and workforce development clearly identifies a need for a data maintenance 

strategy. Development of a coordinated production strategy for NGA that encompasses a 

repeatable business process for developing agency data production and maintenance 

plans (i.e.annual and multi-year plans) is required.

7.9 Portrayal 

This sub-clause is a placeholder for a future specification of the portrayal rules for Local 

MSD data. 

 

7.10 Data product delivery  

This document specifies the rules for data delivery of Local MSD using GML 3.2.1 as an 

encoding and Web Feature Service (WFS) as a service interface. 

NOTE 1 In the future, additional delivery formats may be added to this document, e.g. ESRI Shapefile, 
ESRI Personal Geodatabase, other relational database output, WMS layers based on portrayal rules, etc.  

This delivery mechanism targets the on-demand use of up-to-date information from the 

GKB-F or other online-accessible data repositories in cases where network connection is 

available.  

The NAS GML Application Schema is a GML application schema according to GML 

3.2.1 and is further described in Annex C. 

The Web Feature Service version that currently supports GML 3.2.1 is WFS 1.1.0 with 

the candidate corrigendum specified in OGC document 08-042. 

 

Delivery medium information  

Units of delivery Feature (with associated information entities) 

Transfer size not applicable 

Medium name Online via Web Feature Service 1.1  

The following additional requirements apply: 

- Web Feature Services that only deliver data shall support 

the Basic Xlink WFS profile. The use of Xlinks shall be 

limited to links within the dataset. 

- Web Feature Services that have to receive updated data 

shall support the Transactional Xlink WFS profile. The 

use of Xlinks shall be limited to links within the dataset. 

- HTTP POST shall be supported for all operations. 

NOTE: It is expected that support for HTTP SOAP will be 

a future requirement. 



OGC 08-077 

Copyright © 2008 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 19 
 

- All HTTP connections shall use HTTPS. 

- Every property that has a GML object as its value that is 

not a feature shall have the object embedded inline. The 

only exception is when an object occurs multiple times in 

an XML document when the first occurance shall be 

embedded inline and the other instances shall be 

referenced using a bare name Xpointer referencing the 

gml:id value in the same document (e.g., 

xlink:href="#fe_132"). Note that this approach has been 

taken due to limitations in the Web Feature Services which 

only provides limited support for objects that are not 

features. 

- Every property that has a feature as its value shall not 

embed the feature inline, but used a xlink:href reference. 

- The DescribeFeatureType operation shall maintain all 

annotations as currently included in the GML application 

schema. 

- The WFS shall announce that it accepts and delivers the 

Local MSD profile of the NAS using its metadata. The 

response to the GetCapabilities operation shall include for 

each feature type a MetadataURL element with the type 

“19139” and the format “text/xml”. The referenced 

metadata entity shall be encoded in accordance with 

ISO/TS 19139 where contentInfo property includes a 

feature catalogue description and the 

featureCatalogueCitation property with citation with the 

identifier with the code  

“http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/schemadcs/lmd/0.9.

0”. 

NOTE: More detailed requirements, e.g. on minimum filter 

capabilities, may be added at a later time.

7.11 Additional information  

7.11.1 General remarks 

This subclause includes any other aspects of Local MSD data not provided elsewhere in 

this document. 

7.11.2 Security classification of data 

The information contained in Local MSD datasets varies in classification depending on 

the geographic location and collection requirements of the data. The classification for 

every feature or feature property that is not UNCLASSIFIED is attached as feature level 

metadata to the respective data element. 

7.11.3 Registers/registries 

Information that is important to interpret the data is maintained in registers and which 

may be made online accessible through the DoD Metadata Registry 

(https://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/) or an OGC Catalogue Service according to the ebXML 

RIM Application Profile. This includes 

- CRS register: The coordinate reference system is referenced from data using a unique 

identifier. The CRS registry contains a full description of every coordinate reference 

system that may be used in Local MSD data.  

If coordinate reference systems are used that are contained in the EPSG register then 

these can be referenced using URNs in the OGC namespace using the guidance in 

OGC document 07-092r1, Definition identifier URNs in OGC namespace version 

1.1.2, http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=24045). Similarly, if other 

organizations like NGA or DGIWG set up such a CRS register, then the coordinate 

reference systems registered there can be used as well. 

- Units register: Units of measurements are referenced from data using a unique 

identifier. The units registry contains a full description of every unit that may be used 

in Local MSD data. 



OGC 08-077 

Copyright © 2008 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 21 
 

The same comment made for coordinate reference systems and registers maintained 

by third parties applies to units as well. 

- NSG Entity Catalog: In some delivery formats, data elements may be encoded using 

shortnames or codes that are defined in the NSG Entity Catalog. This may be done 

due to limitations of the delivery format (i.e. character limitations in current GIS 

software) or to reduce the size of encoded data. In this case, it is required to access the 

contents of the NSG Entity Catalog to understand the meaning of a particular data 

item, for example, the meaning of a code of an enumerant in a coded attribute value 

domain. 

- GSIP View registry: Views do not have an impact on the Local MSD application 

schema or any Local MSD dataset. However, views are useful to provide user friendly 

access to MSD data. MSD data includes a larger number of feature types and views 

allow access to groups of feature types based on categories. This involves accessing 

views from a registry in order to compile WFS queries that select feature based on 

views.  

As this applies to all GSIP-based data content specifications in the same way, more 

detailed information is provided in the document “GSIP Schema Processing”. 

7.12 Metadata  

Local MSD implements metadata at the dataset and feature levels. These metadata shall 

be implemented in conformance with NSG Metadata Implementation Specification 

(NMIS) – Part 2 – XML Exchange Schema, version 1.0.  

All data delivery of Local MSD data (through a WFS or otherwise) shall include the 

appropriate dataset and feature level discovery metadata encoded according to NSG 

Metadata Implementation Specification (NMIS) – Part 2 – XML Exchange Schema, 

version 1.0.
