Abstract 

This OGC® Engineering Report provides guidelines for the harvest, registration and 
retrieval of aviation resources from an OGC web catalogue/registry service (OGC CSW-
ebRIM), with particular emphasis on ISO metadata resources. Alternatives for selective 
and efficient retrieval of such resources are also described along with lessons learned. 
The OGC CSW-ebRIM registry interface is evaluated against SESAR registry 
requirements, documented as a gap analysis, to assess whether there are any obstacles to 
implementing SESAR registry with an OGC CSW-ebRIM interface.

What is OGC Web Services 9 (OWS-9)? 

OWS-9 builds on the outcomes of prior OGC interoperability initiatives and is organized 
around the following threads: 

-   Aviation: Develop and demonstrate the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange 
Model (AIXM) and the Weather Exchange Model (WXXM) in an OGC Web Services 
environment, focusing on support for several Single European Sky ATM Research 
(SESAR) project requirements as well as FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) 
Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) and Aircraft Access to SWIM (System 
Wide Information Management) (AAtS) requirements. 

-   Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI): Build on the CCI work accomplished in 
OWS–8 by increasing interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, 
focusing on semantic mediation, query results delivery, data provenance and quality and 
Single Point of Entry Global Gazetteer. 

-   Security and Services Interoperability (SSI): Investigate 5 main activities: Security 
Management, OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard 
Application Schema UGAS (UML to GML Application Schema) Updates, Web Services 
Façade, Reference Architecture Profiling, and Bulk Data Transfer. 

-   OWS Innovations: Explore topics that represent either new areas of work for the 
Consortium (such as GPS and Mobile Applications), a desire for new approaches to 
existing technologies to solve new challenges (such as the OGC Web Coverage Service 
(WCS) work), or some combination of the two.

1.4.1 Standardize WSDL documents for OWS 

In OWS-9 Aviation, ISO 19119/19139 Service Metadata was automatically generated 
from OWS Capabilities Documents to improve OWS interoperability of service 
discovery applications. There were several non-OWS component service 
implementations (and some OWS service implementations) in OWS-9 that only 
published service descriptions as WSDL documents. However, it was found that the 
WSDL documents provided: 

 Did not follow any common implementation guidelines 

 Ranged widely with respect to organization and level of completeness 

 Tended to have lighter service descriptions compared to Capabilities and ISO 
Service metadata 

 Most did not pass schema validation. 

Therefore, we it is currently not possible to properly automate the creation of ISO Service 
Metadata from WSDL documents as was done for OWS Capabilities in OWS-9. The 
proposed future work items shall improve the interoperability of WSDL-capable 
applications in OWS environments (e.g. SESAR Registry) by: 

1. Developing an OWS/ISO profile of the WSDL standard. 

2. Developing best practices for the creation/transformation of WSDL documents 
in/to the OWS/ISO profile of WSDL. 

3. The automatic generation of OWS/ISO profiled WSDL directly from OWS 
Capabilities documents and ISO 19139 Service Metadata. 

1.4.2 Harmonize/Bridge Profiles of CSW that support ISO Metadata 

Perform a Gap Analysis and Design and Implement an Interface bridge between the two 
profiles of CSW that support the ISO 19115/19119/19139 Metadata information model, 
namely CSW-ISO and CSW-ebRIM (loaded with the CIM Registry Package). Both of 
these OGC CSW profile standards already support the common CSW GetRecord 
interface, OGC Filter Encoding, and the ISO Metadata information model. The outcomes 
of this task shall provide: 

1. Harmonized Implementation/Deployment Guidelines (OGC Best Practice) to 
enable interoperability between the CSW ISO and ebRIM-CIM profile 
implementations. 



OGC 12-144

2. A registry/catalogue Client Component to demonstrate that common requests and 
transactions of the harmonized Service Interface Standard work with both CSW-
ISO and CSW-ebRIM Service implementations.

5 Executive Summary/Overview 

Aviation resources such as AIXM features, portrayal rules, schemas, and metadata for 
datasets and services, were harvested in the OWS-9 project and published into the Galdos 
INdicio web registry service (OGC CSW-ebRIM) to enable optimal discovery and 
retrieval of these resources. The SESAR Registry Demonstrator supported only service 
metadata and so the same service metadata was loaded in both registries (see Section 8.5 
for further details on the SESAR Registry Demonstrator). Over one million registry 
objects representing the aviation resources and associations between them were loaded 
into the OGC registry service. The associations/relationships between the aviation 
resources were captured in conformance with the ISO TC211 19101-2001 Domain 
Reference Model applied to the aviation domain as illustrated in the following annotated 
diagram. The white boxes that annotate each of the shaded resource type boxes represent 
sample instances of resources that were deployed and managed. 

 

The Domain Reference Model from ISO 19101-2001 (Figure 5), adapted to the aviation 
domain as shown above, was also discussed in the OWS-9 Metadata & Provenance ER 
([10], Section 4.3) from the perspective of modeling of aviation metadata resources. In 
this Registry ER, the focus is on publishing the aviation resources to registry service 
implementations in a standardized way to optimize discovery and retrieval. 

As part of the registry task in OWS-9, the OGC Cataloguing ISO Metadata (CIM) 
registry model was used to publish the aviation resources as registry objects. The CIM 
registry model (currently a draft specification being developed by the OGC CIM SWG) 



OGC 12-144

provides a standardized way to represent ISO 19115 and 19119 metadata as registry 
objects for the discovery of datasets and services. The loaded registry object instances 
were used to represent the resource types (service, dataset, metadata, application schema, 
feature instance, and geometry) and the association types (operates on, describes, defines 
the content of, contained feature, contained object, and spatial representation).  

The following registry client screenshot displays the result of a registry query with a 
spatial filter (using OGC Filter) for metadata in a region surrounding the Bradley 
International Airport in Connecticut, USA. Dataset metadata from several AIXM features 
are returned including: the airport/heliport, runways, taxiways, aprons, etc. The geometry 
was harvested along with the ISO dataset metadata from each of the WFS Services to 
enable OGC CSW-ebRIM spatial queries. The client view screen is rendered by styling 
the registry’s XML response to graphical form. 

 

Similarly, spatial searches can be executed on service metadata and the response results 
can be displayed in the map view showing the bounding box extent of the service’s data 
offering (harvested from the OWS Capabilities documents). The following screenshots 
from left to right show the map view results of the ifGI OGC Event Service (full global

coverage) and the Snowflake WFS (half globe coverage containing Europe/Asia), 
respectively: 

     

The following registry client screenshot displays the summary of an AIXM runway 
feature’s time slice metadata. In particular, the properties shown on the following landing 
screen, include the contents of the ‘summary’ XML view (‘brief’, ‘summary’ and ‘full’ 
views can be requested from CSW-ebRIM), such as the name, description, type, life-
cycle status, issue date, parent runway feature identifier info, and any other ‘slot’ 
properties of the object.  

 

Additional information can be seen in the client by clicking on the other tabs such as 
‘Aliases’, ‘Tags’, ‘Associations’, ‘Repository Item’, and ‘XML’. Associations can be 
shown in either graph view or list view. An example screenshot showing the associations 
in graph view, between a service metadata record and its associated operations and 
constraints, in the case of the 52North Event Service (SES), is as follows.

The OWS Capabilities or WSDL documents were used to automatically generate ISO 
19139 service metadata for each service and published into the registry. A request for all 
services in the registry returns the services as listed in the table above as shown in the 
following registry client screen shot.

Note that the service metadata corresponding to the list of services shown above was also 
loaded in the SESAR Registry Demonstrator using WSDL documents as inputs (WSDL 
is required by the SESAR Registry). In the cases where a WSDL document was not 
published, it was automatically generated from an OWS Capabilities document. 

The complete resource inventory of feature and metadata instances offered by OGC Web 
Feature Service implementations (by Comsoft GmbH and Snowflake Software Ltd.) was 
also captured to supplement the feature type service metadata found in OGC WFS 
capabilities documents. A screen shot showing the result of the request for the entire 
resource inventory of the Snowflake WFS as a dataset collection is shown in the registry 
client as follows:

The Snowflake and Comsoft WFS inventory consists of AIXM 5.1 datasets (EAD, 
Estonia, etc.). Each WFS dataset collection was organized into a hierarchy using the ISO 
19115/19139 Dataset Metadata model, in this case, divided into a collection of feature 
type datasets, which are subsets of the WFS Dataset, shown as ‘Subset’ associations in 
the above screenshot. The feature type dataset collection metadata was further divided 
into feature instance metadata subsets as shown for the aixm:AirportSuppliesService 
feature type dataset in the following registry client screenshot. The ‘Subset’ association 
with direction ‘from’ the WFS dataset, in the highlighted row of the screenshot indicates 
that the feature type dataset is a sub-collection of the WFS dataset collection. The 
‘Subset’ associations with direction ‘to’ the AirportSuppliesService_* feature 
instance metadata in the rows following the highlighted row indicate that the feature 
instance metadata is a subset of the feature type dataset collection.

Since the dataset and service records in the registry are linked in the registry model by the 
‘OperatesOn’ association, a stored query can be issued that finds all services that operate 
on a dataset record given a feature id (either the gml:id or gml:identifier values can 
be used). For example, if we want to find all services that operate on the feature with 
gml:id=”gid-634788952283357863”, the following stored query (called 
ServicesByFeatureId) can be issued in any web browser: 

 
http://wrs2.galdosinc.com/ows9/query/stored/ServicesByFeatureId?id=gid-634788952283357863 
 
 

This query returns the COMSOFT CADAS-AIMDB WFS 2.0 Metadata Service record 
(with id=urn:uuid:8d6f51ad-cbc1-4672-8fea-4ac2c7d1b77c), which when retrieved 
using the registry client has the following screenshot:

The loaded metadata representing dataset collections and dataset instances capture all of 
the fields specified by the requirements and guidance for the Aviation ISO 19115 
metadata profile (OGC 11-171 and OGC 11-172). In addition, the registry captures other 
useful metadata including feature instance counts, metadata instance counts, and raw 
XML document size, as summarized in the following table for the Snowflake WFS.

Further details of how CIM was used to publish aviation resources are contained in 
section 6. The harvest objects are summarized using deployed examples in sections 6.1.1 
and 6.2.1 and the corresponding registration process is described in sections 6.1.2 and 
6.2.2. A CIM deficiency related to lineage/provenance registration was identified and the 
proposed CIM extensions to meet the aviation requirements are documented in section 
6.1.3. The proposed CIM extensions were a welcome submission to the CIM SWG and 
the status to date is that they have been accepted without modification for addition to the 
CIM candidate standard by the CIM SWG chair to be voted on through the OGC SWG 
consensus process. 

The selective and efficient retrieval study, discussed in the Aviation Metadata & 
Provenance ER, was investigated using the deployed OGC CSW-ebRIM registry service 
and the results include a fast and iterative Metadata X-Ray retrieval implementation (as 
described in the OWS-9 Metadata and Provenance ER) in section 7.  

Finally a gap analysis was conducted between the SESAR and CSW-ebRIM registries 
and the results discussed in section 7.2.1.1. 

6 Use of OGC Cataloging ISO Metadata (CIM) Registry Model 

The CIM registry model consists of an XML registry package that can be loaded into any 
CSW-ebRIM registry service to manage ISO metadata for datasets, services, and 
associations to other discoverable objects. In CIM, dataset and service metadata are both 
represented as a type of resource metadata object with an association between them, as 
depicted in CIM ([7], Fig 16), shown below: 



OGC 12-144 

16 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

The service metadata object is further described by attributes (slots) and classified by 
multiple taxonomies (represented by the ebRIM classification and ClassificationScheme 
stereo-types) for optimal discovery as shown below, from CIM ([7], Fig 8): 

 

Similarly, the CIM dataset metadata object is described by attributes and classifications. 
The dataset hierarchy can also by represented as a dataset collection containing subsets of 
more elementary datasets as shown below, from CIM ([7], Fig 15):

6.1 Dataset Metadata (ISO 19115) 

In order to load and manage the complete dataset metadata model meeting the 
requirements of the Aviation and NNEW metadata profiles using CIM, an extension for 
the ISO Data Quality component in CIM was required and developed in OWS-9. In 
particular, the lineage/provenance metadata is a required subcomponent of Data Quality 
in Aviation. The extension of CIM developed in OWS-9, was contributed to the OGC 
CIM SWG and is the topic of the formal OGC Change Request ([11]), OGC CIM CR: 
LI_Lineage (Provenance) Components (OGC 13-013). After deploying the Data Quality 
extension, documented in Section 6.1.3 (and in [11]), the dataset metadata instances were 
harvested and published to the Aviation Registry. The steps involved in publishing to the 
CIM model are described in the next sections.  

6.1.1 Resource Metadata Harvested in OWS-9 

Several types of discovery metadata were harvested into the OWS-9 Aviation Registry 
including application schemas, ISO 19115/19139 Metadata, feature geometry (to enable 
discovery by spatial filters) including associations between these resources. Multiple 
instances (in the case of dataset metadata, several hundred thousand) of each of the 
following resource types shown in the following aviation domain reference model, were 
harvested in the OGC CSW-ebRIM registry service for a total of over a million registry 
objects. 



OGC 12-144 

18 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

Several examples including some registry client screenshots are shown in Section 5 
(Executive Summary/Overview). 

Dataset metadata from the WFS service AIXM feature instances were harvested, 
including: the airport/heliport, runways, taxiways, aprons, etc. If ISO 19139 metadata 
was not provided with the feature or its time-slice instances, then a minimal encoding 
was automatically generated during the harvest operation. The feature’s geometry was 
also harvested at the same time as the ISO dataset metadata from every feature instance 
in each of the WFS Services to enable OGC CSW-ebRIM spatial queries. A sample 
search result displayed in the ‘map’ view of the registry client is as follows.

6.1.2 Publication Process 

The different components of the CIM model are typically published by different actors, 
as shown for one OWS-9 aviation scenario illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

6.1.3 Data Quality Extension to CIM 

In OWS-9, it was necessary to make use of the ISO 19139 Data Quality model for 
registration in CSW-ebRIM, in order to properly discover/query for data quality and its 
subcomponents in the CSW-ebRIM service. The latest version of the Cataloguing ISO 
Metadata (CIM) document (OGC 07-038r3, v0.1.11, 2009-07-14) had not specified a 
mapping for the lineage/provenance components contained in ISO 19139 
DQ_DataQuality  (including LI_Lineage, LI_ProcessStep, and LI_Source) to the 
CIM ebRIM model. The extent of the data quality mapping information in the CIM 
standard was very limited and is shown in the following table: 

CIM Table 39: - From DQ_ConformanceResult to QualityConformanceInformation 

ISO 19115/ ISO 19119 CIM Comments 
Title <<slot>>specTitle  
dateType <<classification>> DateType  
Date <<slot>>specDate  
Pass <<slot>> specPass  

In OWS-9, we used this opportunity to extend the CIM registry model and deployment 
package to include the necessary lineage/provenance components.  

The focus of this proposed extension was to support ISO DQ_DataQuality elements 
relevant to the metadata provenance scenario, including capturing the metadata 
corresponding to a Data Management Service (DMS) processing a WFS request for re-
distribution to the DMS clients.

The details of the CIM registry model extension for data quality are documented in data 
dictionary and mapping tables in the following sub-sections. The new additions were 
developed in this extension following the same pattern as the existing CIM mappings and 
are proposed additions to the CIM standard.

6.2 Service Metadata (ISO 19119) 

ISO 19119 Service metadata provides complementary metadata to ISO 19115 dataset 
metadata and uses the same XML element 19139 gmd:MD_Metadata element for its 
representation. The core information contained in the ISO service metadata are the 
properties of the service instance that vary among instances of the same service type, 
such as the name, endpoint URL, supported inputs, operations, and output offerings. 

The OGC CIM registry model supports ISO 19119 service metadata. However, the OWS-
9 deployed services were predominantly OGC Web Services (OWSs), so the majority of 
the service metadata content was captured by the mandatory OWS Capabilities 
documents. Therefore, the mapping of OWS capabilities documents to ISO 19119/19139 
service metadata was investigated in OWS-9 and the corresponding transformation was 
executed during the registry harvest operation. This mapping to ISO service metadata 
was conducted for the different OWS types (e.g. WFS, FPS, WPS, CSW-ebRIM, etc.) 
that were deployed in OWS-9. The following sections provide examples of harvested 
metadata resources and the methodology used to publish and access the resources.

6.2.1 Resource Metadata Examples Harvested in OWS-9 

As with dataset metadata, spatial filters in a registry query can be applied to the service 
metadata record and the response can be displayed in the ‘map’ view of the registry client 
showing the bounding box extent of the service’s data offering (typically harvested from 
the OWS Capabilities documents). The following screenshots from left to right show the 
map view results of the ifGI OGC Event Service (full global coverage) and the 
Snowflake WFS (half globe coverage containing Europe/Asia), respectively: 

     

Service metadata is associated to other registry objects representing operations supported 
by the service and constraints/limitations of use. Associations can be shown in registry 
client in either the graph view or list view. An example screenshot showing the 
associations in graph view, between a service metadata record and its operations and 
constraints, in the case of the 52North Event Service (SES), is as follows. 



OGC 12-144

The list view showing the same associations is as follows: 

 

The following OWS services were harvested for service and dataset metadata by using 
either OWS Capabilities or WSDL documents as inputs (see 1.4.1 and 8.5 for additional 
details on the use of WSDL inputs).

The OWS-9 AIXM 5.1 Demonstrator WFS provides access to a 
wide range of AIXM 5.1 features for the EUROPE sector. 
DISCLAIMER: This data should be used for research and 
development purposes only. It is not suitable for operational 
purposes. 

 

The OWS Capabilities or WSDL documents were used to automatically generate ISO 
19139 service metadata for each service and published into the registry. A request for all 
services in the registry returns the following results in the registry client. 



OGC 12-144 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 33 
 

 

The service metadata corresponding to the list of services shown above was also loaded 
in the SESAR Registry Demonstrator using WSDL documents as inputs (WSDL is 
required by the SESAR Registry). In cases where a WSDL document was not provided, it 
was automatically generated from an OWS Capabilities document. 

The complete resource inventory of feature and metadata instances offered by OGC Web 
Feature Service implementations (by Comsoft GmbH and Snowflake Software Ltd.) was 
also captured to supplement the feature type service metadata found in OGC WFS 
capabilities documents. A screen shot showing the entire resource inventory of the 
Snowflake WFS as a dataset collection is shown in the registry client as follows: 



OGC 12-144 

34 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

The Snowflake and Comsoft WFS inventory consists of AIXM 5.1 datasets (EAD, 
Estonia, etc.). Each WFS dataset collection was organized into a hierarchy using the ISO 
19115/19139 Dataset Metadata model, in this case, divided into a collection of feature 
type datasets, which are subsets of the WFS Dataset, shown as ‘Subset’ associations in 
the above screenshot. The feature type dataset collection metadata was further divided 
into feature instance metadata subsets as shown for the aixm:AirportSuppliesService 
feature type dataset in the following registry client screenshot. The ‘Subset’ association 
with direction ‘from’ the WFS dataset, in the highlighted row of the screenshot indicates 
that the feature type dataset is a sub-collection of the WFS dataset collection. The 
‘Subset’ associations with direction ‘to’ the AirportSuppliesService_* feature 
instance metadata in the rows following the highlighted row indicate that the feature 
instance metadata is a subset of the feature type dataset collection.

Since the dataset and service records in the registry are linked in the registry model by the 
‘OperatesOn’ association, a stored query can be issued that finds all services that operate 
on a dataset record given a feature id (either the gml:id or gml:identifier values can 
be used). For example, if we want to find all services that operate on the feature with 
gml:id=”gid-634788952283357863”, the following stored query (called 
ServicesByFeatureId) can be issued in any web browser: 

 
http://wrs2.galdosinc.com/ows9/query/stored/ServicesByFeatureId?id=gid-634788952283357863 
 
 

This query returns the COMSOFT CADAS-AIMDB WFS 2.0 Metadata Service record 
(with id=urn:uuid:8d6f51ad-cbc1-4672-8fea-4ac2c7d1b77c), which when retrieved 
using the registry client has the following screenshot:

The loaded metadata representing dataset collections and dataset instances capture all of 
the fields specified by the requirements and guidance for the Aviation ISO 19115 
metadata profile (OGC 11-171 and OGC 11-172). In addition, the registry captures other 
useful metadata including feature instance counts, metadata instance counts, and raw 
XML document size, as summarized in the following table for the Snowflake WFS.

6.2.2 Publication Process 

The Harvest operation enables a ‘pull’ style of registration, whereby ISO 19139 metadata 
and other resources are retrieved from a remote location and inserted into the registry. 
Registration of aviation resources can also be pushed into the registry via the standard 
Insert/Update Transaction operations. Alternatively, an event notification could be sent to 
a registry service when a registered resource changes, to invoke a pulled harvest update. 
In OWS-9, the aviation registry implemented the harvest/pull registration of aviation 
resources. 

6.2.2.1 Publishing ISO Service Metadata by Harvesting OWS Capabilities  

The service metadata from any OWS can be retrieved or harvested via a GetCapabilities 
operation (also discussed in the broader context of OWS in Section Error! Reference 
source not found.). The service metadata is then loaded into a CSW-ebRIM registry by 
transforming the OWS capabilities document response to ISO 19139 service metadata, 
along with any other metadata useful for the discovery and access/binding to the service. 

Starting with the OGC Capabilities document for each OWS type as an input, an XSLT 
transformation was created to generate the corresponding ISO 19139 service metadata, 
which gets automatically transformed by the CSW-ebRIM service implementation to the 
appropriate registry objects in the OGC CIM registry model. 

The following diagram illustrates publish/harvest methodology.  



OGC 12-144 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 39 
 

 

Pre-existing associations defined in the CSW-ebRIM standard are also instantiated when 
service metadata is published, using the CIM registry model as summarized in the 
following table.

7 Results of Selective and Efficient Retrieval of Metadata 

The typical problem reported in the aviation threads of past OWS initiatives (Phases 6, 7, 
8) was that when a feature’s metadata is retrieved encoded as ISO 19139, the full inline 
encoding of gmd:MD_Metadata was retrieved, which is typically a significant portion of 
the size (~40%)  of the feature instance. There is currently no general or common OWS 
support for the selective and efficient retrieval of ISO 19139 metadata, even though most, 
if not all, of the metadata was not used by the OWS aviation clients. In order to address 
the selective and efficient retrieval of metadata, user control over the size of the response 
should be enabled in the request.  Details of the discussion (at a conceptual level) of 
efficient and selective retrieval of metadata were introduced in the OWS-9 Aviation 
Metadata & Provenance ER ([10], Section 7). In the Registry ER, efficient and selective 
retrieval of metadata is demonstrated using OGC CSW-ebRIM registry queries and 
documented in the following sub-sections 7.1 and 7.2. In Section 7.1, the implementation 
results of efficiently returning metadata in the ‘Metadata X-Ray’ encoding are described. 
In Section 7.2, the implementation results of selectively retrieving sub-components of 
metadata inline or by-reference are shown, including examples of returning metadata in 
the ‘Data Quality X-Ray’ and ‘Lineage X-Ray’ encodings. 

7.1 Efficient Retrieval of Metadata 

The minimum size of a valid encoding of ISO 19139 metadata occurs when all metadata 
child elements are encoded by reference – this encoding is referred to as the ‘Metadata X-
Ray encoding’ in the OWS-9 Metadata & Provenance ER ([10]). Note that ISO 19139 
allows for many different valid encodings of metadata. An illustrative example of the 
Metadata X-Ray is as follows:

The relative size comparison of the full inline metadata encoding vs. the Metadata X-Ray 
encoding is quite significant, the latter being roughly 20 times smaller for a typical 
aviation metadata instance. The size comparison for typical metadata instances are 
provided in the following table.

7.1.1 Implementation Methodology 

The full inline encoding of ISO 19139 was first harvested as a repository item in the 
OGC CSW-ebRIM registry. A basic GetRepository item request would return the full 
inline encoding by default, if a more efficient encoding is not requested. A new 
parameter, called the view parameter was added to the request to further refine the 
output, i.e. transform the default encoding to an alternate valid response (e.g. the 
Metadata X-Ray encoding). The value of the view parameter is simply the id of a 
registered transformation in the registry, which gets executed on the default response 
output. 

An HTTP GET/KVP query using a view parameter has the following form: 

 
http://some.GetRepositoryItem.request&view=ID 
 
 

The ID value above is the repository item id value of the transformation to be used to 
view the result, in the case of the Metadata X-Ray it is: 

 
urn:x-ows9:def:script:OGC:MetadataXray 
 



OGC 12-144 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 43 
 

The registered transformation corresponding to the Metadata X-Ray was an XSLT script 
(MetadataXRay.xsl) that transforms the gmd:MD_Metadata instance in the repository to 
another valid gmd:MD_Metadata instance encoded by-reference everywhere, i.e. with 
every xlink:href attribute value populated by a URI request that points to the content 
of the child element. The xlink:href URI value is set to a registry request that returns 
the child element. The MetadataXray.xsl transformation is contained in the 
ouputTransformations.zip archive accompanying this ER 

An example request and response are shown in the following sub-sections. 

7.1.1.1 Full Inline Metadata Request 

The standard GetRepositoryItem request by id returns the full in-line metadata encoding, 
the default representation.

    &id=urn:uuid:8d6f51ad-cbc1-4672-8fea-4ac2c7d1b77c 
 

 

7.1.1.2 Metadata X-Ray Request 

A GetRepositoryItem request with the following view parameter returns the Metadata X-
Ray encoding (see the following response).

7.1.1.3 Metadata X-Ray Response 

 

7.2 Selective Retrieval 

To address the selective retrieval of metadata, the query should enable the parameter 
selection of pertinent metadata to be encoded inline, and the remaining metadata 
compactly encoded with references that a client can resolve in a subsequent step, if 
desired. Two important categories of selection parameters are: ‘selection by name’ 
parameters and ‘selection by id type’ parameters.  

An example of a ‘selection by name’ parameter is illustrated by the DataQuality X-Ray 
and Lineage X-Ray retrieval mechanisms, where a query returns a result with some 
selected metadata child objects (e.g. DQ_DataQuality and LI_Lineage) encoded in-line 
while others are referenced (introduced in the OWS-9 Metadata & Provenance ER [10]).  

The Data Quality X-Ray is the case where ‘selection by name’ parameter is set to the 
element gmd:DQ_DataQuality and is illustrated in the following figure. 



OGC 12-144 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 45 
 

 

See Section 7.2.1.1 for the implementation of the Data Quality X-Ray retrieval. 

The Lineage X-Ray is the case where ‘selection by name’ parameter selects the element 
names: gmd:DQ_DataQuality and gmd:LI_Lineage is illustrated in the following figure.

See Section 7.2.1.1 for the implementation of the Lineage X-Ray retrieval. 

The ‘selection by id type’ scheme is to request that all sub-objects in the MD_Metadata 
encoding of metadata that have a populated id value (e.g. the optional id and uuid 
attributes in 19139 metadata) to be encoded by-reference; and all objects without an id, 
to be encoded in-line. Note that in OWS-9 a significant number of metadata instances had 
a mix of objects with and without an id attribute. In this case, the metadata author 
determines which objects get returned in-line by the population of id values on objects.  

 

7.2.1 Implementation Methodology 

As described in Section 7.1.1, the CSW-ebRIM GetRepositoryItem request can be used 
to retrieve ISO 19139 metadata and the view parameter identifies a registered 
transformation to be apply to the output response. A registered transformation, 
ObjectSkeleton.xsl, selectively encodes, through a parameter input, some element objects 
inline and some using xlink:href with a URI value to a registry request that resolves 
the object. The ObjectSkeleton.xsl transformation is contained in the 
ouputTransformations.zip archive accompanying this ER and is invoked by the Lineage

X-Ray representation using a ‘selection by name’ parameter ObjectsWantedInline. The 
value of the ObjectsWantedInline parameter is a list of desired element object names to 
be encoded in-line. The Lineage X-Ray encoding requires that both the gmd:DQ_Quality 
and gmd:LI_Lineage elements are retrieved in-line. The following section 7.2.1.1 shows 
an example request, where Lineage metadata is selected for in-line retrieval. 

7.2.1.1 Data Quality X-Ray Request 

In the case that only Data Quality metadata is desired to be encoded in-line (i.e. the Data 
Quality X-Ray representation), the parameter value would be 

 
ObjectsWantedInline = ‘gmd:DQ_DataQuality’ 
 
 

The DataQuality.xsl transformation (in the ouputTransformations.zip archive 
accompanying this ER) invokes the registered ObjectSkeleton.xsl using the parameter as 
shown above. A CSW-ebRIM GetRepositoryItem request with the following view 
parameter returns the Data Quality X-Ray representation.

8 OGC CSW-ebRIM Interface and SESAR Registry Requirements 

This section provides a gap analysis between the SESAR Registry Demonstrator and the 
OGC CSW-ebRIM 1.0.1 registry specification.  The purpose of this Gap Analysis is to 
determine how well aligned these two registry service specifications are currently. The 
analysis considered various aspects of these registry services, such as:  supported entities 
and relationships types, available service methods, user roles, as well as processing (use 
cases) and security features. 

The primary aspects of the registry services that will be reviewed here are summarized in 
the following table.

8.1 Overview of the Candidate Registries 

The SESAR Registry Demonstrator, also called the SWIM Registry, is described in the 
“SWIM Registry Concept of Operations V1” as follows: 

The SWIM registry aims at improving the visibility and accessibility of ATM information and 
services available through SWIM. This enables service providers, consumers, and 
regulatory authorities to share a common view on SWIM. 

The SWIM registry is a one stop shop for service information. It describes the complete set 
of services enabled by SWIM (like the service that allows getting the reference business 
trajectory for a flight) with qualitative, consolidated and structured information. The registry 
is also the source of reference for other service related information such as standards, 
policies and certifications. 

The SWIM registry will enable direct ATM business benefits to all of its stakeholders by: 

 Allowing providers (mainly those sharing information over SWIM) to increase 
visibility (and consequent adoption) of their services. It will also support them in 
managing their relationship with consumers and managing dependencies with other 
services, standards or regulations.

 Improving the efficiency of consumers (mainly those getting information from other 
stakeholders over SWIM) in identifying the right provider and reducing their effort in 
setting up everything required prior to start using a service. 

 Facilitating a collaborative evolution of services by enabling all relevant stakeholders 
to share a common view and participate in the lifecycle of these. 

By comparison, the CSW-ebRIM registry is described in “CSW-ebRIM Registry Service 
- Part 1: ebRIM profile of CSW” as: 

CSW-ebRIM Registry Service: a profile of the CSW part (Clause 10) of the OpenGIS® 
Catalogue Service Implementation Specification (v2.0.2, OGC-07-006r1).  It applies the 
CSW interfaces to the OASIS ebXML registry information model (ebRIM 3.0) so as to 
provide a general and flexible web-based registry service that enables users—human or 
software agents—to locate, access, and make use of resources in an open, distributed 
system; it provides facilities for retrieving, storing, and managing many kinds of resource 
descriptions. 

8.2 Gap Analysis 

The following sections provide the tabulated results of the gap analysis. The shaded non-
header rows indicate a gap between the SESAR registry requirements and support by the 
CSW-ebRIM interface standard. A discussion of the gaps is provided in section 8.4.

with its related sub-types: 
ServiceBinding and 
SpecificationLink. 

Additional object-

ClassificationScheme concept 
which is a tree of 
ClassificationNodes.  Each 
ClassificationNode defines a 
“category”.  ClassificationNodes 
are used in ebRIM to classify any 
RegistryObject (multiple times, 
as required).   

CSW-ebRIM 
supports the 
definition of 
unlimited schemes 
which may be flat 
(1 level deep) or 
deeply nested, as 
needed. 

Participant A support entity used to 
generically refer to all 
actors relevant to the 
system:  Systems 
(software agents), 
Persons, Users 
(authenticated persons) 
and Orgranizations. 

Use the ebRIM object-types:  
Person, User and Organization.   
Users are typically authenticated 
Persons in ebRIM. Where it is 
necessary to identify specific 
sub-groups of Persons, they can 
be segmented by Classification.  
A RegistryObject may classified 
multiple times via the addtion of 
Classification object.

RegistryObjects to

own links and does not 
require any additional 
Associations. 

 

8.2.3 User Roles 

The CSW-ebRIM specification does not specify a particular identity management 
approach for registry implementations, nor does it define any User Roles.   

The minimal requirement for CSW-ebRIM registries would be to integrate with a 
standard identity management component (e.g. for example, an LDAP service) that 
provides User and Role information and to support its provisioning to the configured 
Access-Control service.  The Access-Control service would perform the policy decision 
evaluation (e.g. act as XACML PDP) while the policy enforcement (e.g. act as XACML 
PEP) would need to be performed by the registry sevice, possibly at multiple different 
processing points. 



OGC 12-144 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 55 
 

 

Therefore the integration requirement for supporting multiple new User Roles is quite 
low.  The primary effort for such integration would be in Policy definition to ensure that 
each Role was appropriately constrained. 

8.2.3.1 High Level SESAR Roles: 

SESAR 
Registry User 
Role Name 

Description 

Service 
Consumer 

It is mainly interested in finding information about services in the registry.  More 
specifically it discovers and subscribes to follow the evolution of services in the 
registry. It is also able to register via the registry for the consumption of 
services. 

Service Provider It is mainly interested in sharing with other registry users its service offer. It is 
also able to manage the service lifecycle in the registry including the publication 
of different versions of a service, the management of dependencies with other 
services or regulations (e.g. standards, policies…) as well as the management 
of its different consumers. 

Regulation 
Authority 

It regulates the service network with the publication of standards, policies, 
certifications and categories. It is able to control and enforce via the registry the 
compliance to these regulations. From the registry point of view, this is just 
another user of the registry, but from a SWIM perspective this role uses the 
registry to manage the governance of the SWIM environment. 

Certification 
Provider 

It provides the service of certification assessments. This role is granted by a 
regulation authority responsible for the certification specification. The 
certification provider conducts assessments (certification provision) of the 
compliancy of participants or services to certain certifications. 

Identity 
Authority 

It is the provider of identities for all users that participate in the service network 
and this includes the users that interact directly with the registry. 

Registry 
Authority 

Equivalent to the role of the regulation authority that is aiming to regulate the 
services of the network, the registry authority issues standards, policies and 
certifications for the regulation of the registry. 

Registry 
Manager 

This role is responsible for the operation of the registry as well as for the 
alignment to the regulations set by the regulation authority 

 

8.2.4 Service Methods 

The SESAR Registry defines multiple similar Service methods that are specific to an 
Entity type.  The getXXX methods typically differ in method-name and filter criteria.  
The putXXX methods differ in method-name and input-type parameters.  In CSW-ebRIM 
such groups of similar methods typically map to a single service method that operates on 
all of the specified Entity types, thus reducing the large number of methods used in 
SESAR Registry to a much smaller, more manageable number.

There is a conceptual gap 
here, because SESAR 
does not define a concept 
of an Entity of type 
‘request’.   
However, this method can 
be readily accommodated 
in CSW-ebRIM by 
modeling requests AND 
grants of accessibility as 
different states of an 
Association between an 
Entity and a Participant.

SWIM. 
Management of 
information 
integrity in the 
registry 6.6 

The registry as an enabler of service 
information integrity, with controls in 
place to manage a multi-user shared 
repository. This implements a 
consolidated access control to service 
information.  
Mandatory business process for SWIM. 

CSW-ebRIM does not require nor 
preclude that an implementation 
be a Policy Enforcement Point 
(PEP) for access control policies. 
The extensibility of ebRIM can 
define the information objects that 
could support the implementation 
of any access control system. 

Management of 
information 
confidentiality in 
the registry 6.7 

The registry as an enabler of service 
information confidentiality, with controls 
in place to manage a multi-user shared 
repository. This implements a 
consolidated access control to service 
information.  
Mandatory business process for SWIM. 

Same as with 6.6 (above) 

Delegated run-
time policy 
enforcement 
managed at the 
registry 6.8 

This use case considers the registry as 
the source of reference for policy 
information for those policy agents 
responsible for the runtime enforcement 
(e.g. application firewalls). This enables 
a consolidated management and control 
of policy enforcement information.  This 
requires a high availability of the registry 
for policy and service information.  
Optional business process for SWIM. 

Supported. 
High availability is not addressed 
by the CSW-ebRIM specification 
and will depend on the registry 
implementation. 
 

Run-time service 
discovery 6.9 

This use case considers the registry as a 
provider of run-time service information. 
This enables a loose coupling with 
services and improves flexibility. This 
requires a high availability of the registry 
for service information.  
Optional business process for SWIM. 

Supported. 
High availability is not addressed 
by the CSW-ebRIM specification 
and will depend on the registry 
implementation. 

 

8.3.1 Security 

This section addresses the security requirements for the registry from two different perspectives: 

 The role of the registry in support of the SWIM security framework. In other words, the supporting 
role of the registry for the implementation of security services in SWIM. 

 The requirements to secure registry held content and access to operations. This describes what is 
needed to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the registry (i.e. data and the 
services that the registry provides).

8.4 Addressing the Gaps – Implementing a SESAR Registry with the OGC CSW-
ebRIM Interface  

The gaps between the scope of the OGC CSW-ebRIM interface and the SESAR registry 
requirements fall into two categories: subscription management and access control 
enforcement, neither of which is prohibited by CSW-ebRIM. The CSW-ebRIM interface 
standard focuses on broader interoperability of the publication and retrieval of resources 
by query/filter over the web. The CSW-ebRIM standard does not specify any type of 
subscription (or registration) procedure and does not preclude any of the choices for 
specific implementations of such procedures. CSW-ebRIM also does not require nor 
preclude that an implementation be a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) for access control 
policies. Alternatively a CSW-ebRIM implementation could participate in a network 
portal where access control is enforced external to the registry at a single sign-on point of 
the portal.  The extensibility of ebRIM can define the information objects to support the 
implementation of any subscription or access control system. 

 

8.5 SESAR Registry Demonstrator 

The starting point for loading service metadata in the SESAR Registry Demonstrator was 
to retrieve/create Web Service Description Language (WSDL) documents for each of the 
service resources. This is one of the differences with respect to loading service metadata 
compared to the CSW-ebRIM aviation registry – a combination of OWS Capabilities and 
WSDL documents were used to harvest metadata from the latter. In the case where a 
service resource (e.g. Snowflake Software WFS 2.0) did not publish a WSDL document, 
but rather the OWS required Capabilities document, a WSDL document needed to be 
generated by some means to load the metadata into the SESAR Registry Demonstrator.  

In OWS-9, several services did publish the required WSDL documents, but not all. In 
OWS-9, the WSDL documents that were produced by service providers, did not follow 
any particular implementation standard, ranged widely with respect to organization and 
level of completeness, and most did not pass schema validation. In the absence of WSDL 
documents, the information in the OWS Capabilities documents was used to generate the 
WSDL. Note that the ISO Service metadata could also have been used to generate WSDL 
documents and this could be explored further as part of the future work item on 
standardizing WSDL for OWS proposed in Section 1.4.1. The WSDL documents that 
were created from OWS Capabilities documents were hand crafted, however it was noted 
that it would be possible to develop and automate the process to generate WSDL in a 
consistent and comprehensive manner with respect to both organization and level of 
completeness. In section 6.2.2 (Publication Process), it was described how ISO 
19119/19139 Service Metadata was automatically generated from OWS Capabilities 
Documents to improve OWS interoperability of discovery applications. However due to 
the lack of standardized structure of WSDL, it is not possible to properly automate the 



OGC 12-144 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 67 
 

creation of ISO Service Metadata from WSDL documents as was done for OWS 
Capabilities. The proposed future work items listed in section 6.2.2 will go a long way to 
improving the interoperability of WSDL-capable applications in OWS environments. 
This list includes: developing an OWS/ISO profile of the WSDL standard, developing 
best practices for the creation/transformation of WSDL documents in/to the OWS/ISO 
profile of WSDL, and automatic generation of OWS/ISO profiled WSDL directly from 
OWS Capabilities documents and ISO 19139 Service Metadata. As a starting point the 
following WSDL structure for OWS is proposed: 

 
 WSDL Definition Structure 
  Types (required) 
   Schemas (required) 
  Messages (optional) 
  Port Type (required) 
  Binding (required) 
   Operations (required) 
  Service (required) 
 
 

The following services were harvested into the SESAR registry demonstrator using the 
input WSDL documents:
