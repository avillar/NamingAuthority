1. Introduction

1.1. The Abstract Specification
The purpose of the Abstract Specification is to create and document a conceptual model sufficient
enough to allow for the creation of Implementation Specifications. The Abstract Specification
consists of two models derived from the Syntropy object analysis and design methodology [1].

The first and simpler model is called the Essential Model and its purpose is to establish the
conceptual linkage of the software or system design to the real world. The Essential Model is a
description of how the world works (or should work).

The second model, the meat of the Abstract Specification, is the Abstract Model that defines the
eventual software system in an implementation neutral manner. The Abstract Model is a description
of how software should work. The Abstract Model represents a compromise between the paradigms
of the intended target implementation environments.

The Abstract Specification is organized into separate topic volumes in order to manage the
complexity of the subject matter and to assist parallel development of work items by different
Working Groups of the OGC Technical Committee. The topics are, in reality, dependent upon one
another each one begging to be written first. Each topic must be read in the context of the entire
Abstract Specification.

The topic volumes are not all written at the same level of detail.  Some are mature, and are the basis
for Requests For Proposal (RFP). Others are immature, and require additional specification before
RFPs can be issued. The level of maturity of a topic reflects the level of understanding and
discussion occurring within the Technical Committee. Refer to the OGC Technical Committee
Policies and Procedures [2] and Technology Development Process [3] documents for more
information on the OGC OpenGIS™ standards development process.

Refer to Topic Volume 0: Abstract Specification Overview [4] for an introduction to all of the topic
volumes comprising the Abstract Specification and for editorial guidance, rules and etiquette for
authors (and readers) of OGC specifications.

1.2. Introduction to Feature Collections
The Open GIS Consortium has not yet achieved consensus on many issues surrounding Feature
Collections.  On the one hand, perhaps Feature Collections are not needed at all.  This is because:

•  a feature can be a composite of other features,

• a “tile” may be a feature composed of the features it contains

• a feature may be “divided” by tile boundaries, yet be “reassembled” on demand by an
interface on Feature or by a service.

On the other hand, the real world seems full of Feature Collections that need to be addressed.
These include:

• projects, which have assignment boundaries and feature capture criteria and thresholds

• products from Government agencies, such as VPF, ADRG, SDTS, ATKIS, and similar files

• GIS database files

• the persistent or non-persistent ad hoc collection of features present at any moment in a GIS
workspace.

Feature Collections seem to need important interfaces in order to support the needs of Catalogs and
Catalog Services.  These interfaces seem to be tightly coupled with Feature Collection Metadata.

2. The Essential Model for Feature Collections

Editor’s Note: This Section, while Baseline Open GIS Abstract Specification, has been assembled
from portions of earlier versions of the Abstract Specification.  As a result, it is somewhat
disjointed, and needs unification.

We have already introduced the notion of a Feature Collection in Topic 5.  We present here a
deeper abstraction.

2.1. Introduction to Feature Collection
An OpenGIS Feature Collection is an abstract object consisting of  Feature Instances, their Feature
Schema, and Project Schema. Figure 2-1 shows OpenGIS Feature Collections in a Syntropy
diagram.

2.2. Feature Schema are the Key to Feature Collections
Figure 2-1 can be simplified by collapsing the Geometry Schema and the Attribute Schema into the
Feature Schema, as we did in Topic 5.  Doing this yields Figure 2-2.

2.3. Interfaces on Feature Collections
The interface between the OpenGIS Feature Collection World and the OpenGIS Feature World is
called the Project Structure Interface.  This interface is transparent, but it is derived from paths
through the Project World.  This is because the members of the OpenGIS Feature Collection World
correspond directly to phenomenon in the Project World, not to a feature in the OpenGIS Feature
World.  Never-the-less, the methods across the Project Structure Interface, called member and
include, are obvious.

The interface between the OpenGIS Feature Collection World and the Project World is called the
Project Schema Interface.  Its methods are also obvious, and are called realize and represent.

As a summary of the above, and as a reformulation of Figure 2-1, we present Figure 2-3.

4. Future Work
Much fundamental work on Feature Collection is needed.  What are the fundamental classes and
subclasses of Feature Collection.  How do they behave? What are the relations between them and
Features, Catalogs, Metadata, Schema, and other objects, and between themselves?  What are the
essential temporal and spatial behaviors of Feature Collections?
