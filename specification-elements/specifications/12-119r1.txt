Abstract 

This engineering report represents the results of the OWS-9 innovations thread on mobile 
applications. Initially, the goal was to help understanding the requirements for developing 
standards-based geospatially-enabled mobile applications. The report describes how 
OGC Enabled Mobile Apps can be integrated into information architectures based on 
OGC standards. Particular emphasize has been put on the future work section, as it 
provides valuable recommendations for further standardization work (and, equally 
important, highlights aspects that could be excluded from standardization)

What is OGC Web Services 9 (OWS-9)? 

OWS-9 builds on the outcomes of prior OGC interoperability initiatives and is organized 
around the following threads: 

-   Aviation: Develop and demonstrate the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange 
Model (AIXM) and the Weather Exchange Model (WXXM) in an OGC Web Services 
environment, focusing on support for several Single European Sky ATM Research 
(SESAR) project requirements as well as FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) 
Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) and Aircraft Access to SWIM (System 
Wide Information Management) (AAtS) requirements. 

-   Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI): Build on the CCI work accomplished in 
OWS–8 by increasing interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, 
focusing on semantic mediation, query results delivery, data provenance and quality and 
Single Point of Entry Global Gazetteer. 

-   Security and Services Interoperability (SSI): Investigate 5 main activities: Security 
Management, OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard 
Application Schema UGAS (UML to GML Application Schema) Updates, Web Services 
Façade, Reference Architecture Profiling, and Bulk Data Transfer. 

-   OWS Innovations: Explore topics that represent either new areas of work for the 
Consortium (such as GPS and Mobile Applications), a desire for new approaches to 
existing technologies to solve new challenges (such as the OGC Web Coverage Service 
(WCS) work), or some combination of the two. 



OGC 12-119r1

-   Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation (CITE): Develop a suite of 
compliance test scripts for testing and validation of products with interfaces 
implementing the following OGC standards: Web Map Service (WMS) 1.3 Interface 
Standard, Web Feature Service (WFS) 2.0 Interface Standard, Geography Markup 
Language (GML) 3.2.1 Encoding Standard, OWS Context 1.0 (candidate encoding 
standard), Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards, Web Coverage Service for Earth 
Observation (WCS-EO) 1.0 Interface Standard, and TEAM (Test, Evaluation, And 
Measurement) Engine Capabilities.

OWS-9 OWS Innovations Mobile Apps Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This engineering report represents the results of the OWS-9 innovations thread on mobile 
applications. Initially, the goal was to help understanding the requirements for developing 
standards-based geospatially-enabled mobile applications. The following elements had 
been identified to be of particular interest: 

 Certification and accreditation of mobile apps 
 Communication technologies, issues, solutions 
 Data loading and synchronization 
 Security and data privacy 
 Mobile apps distribution options 
 Quality of results and services 
 Metadata aspects for mobile apps and web-based services 

During the context of OWS-9, it became clear that a much more important key question 
has to be answered first: “What is an OGC Enabled Mobile App?” Therefore, this 
engineering report first defines the OGC Enabled Mobile App and focuses on the key 
characteristics of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps. The report describes how OGC Enabled 
Mobile Apps can be integrated into information architectures based on OGC standards. 
Particular emphasize has been put on the future work section, as it provides valuable 
recommendations for further standardization work (and, equally important, highlights 
aspects that could be excluded from standardization).

1.4 Future work 

This document was developed in the context of OWS-9. Future initiatives shall define the 
various aspects of mobile apps more precisely to improve ease of use, market acceptance, 
and interoperability between system components related to mobile applications. In 
particular, the following aspects shall be addressed:  

Synchronization 

Synchronization aspects have been briefly addressed in OWS-9, but require further 
discussion. In addition, it was not clear if the synchronization mechanism for large data 
sets, e.g. new tiles for satellite imagery, is a topic for OGC standardization at all. 
Distributing image tiles might rather be a typical situation of rapid distribution of large 
data sets than a geo-sync scenario. 

Independently of the distribution of large data sets (and given the growing computing 
power of and the opportunity to connect external sensors to cell phones, a two-way 
synchronization may become relevant), the two-way synchronization of feature data sets 
is already a topic that requires further OGC testbed activities. Two general patterns are 
applicable, i.e. either service oriented messaging to send update requests to service 
endpoints with or without dedicated synchronization services (which would require 
explicit knowledge about all service endpoints and the data origin at the endpoint in case 
of sets of data layers), or subscription to update feeds on both sides. 

Once the GeoPackage specification is fully endorsed, the two-way synchronization can 
be elaborated in full detail. GeoPackage is a powerful tool for offline data handling, but 
makes a two-way synchronization challenging: Who submits the changes to the feed/sync 
service, the geopackaging service or the GeoPackage itself? Who really understands 
which base data corresponds to what type of data in a GeoPackage? Wouldn’t that be a 
tough requirement for a geopackaging service? Keeping track of all mappings between 
original data sources and created GeoPackages? What kind of extensions would be 
necessary for the geosync-service to support the feed approach? 



OGC 12-119r1

In addition, updates to base data sets need to get communicated through all layers. Let’s 
assume a typical scenario to illustrate this requirement: Routes are stored on the device in 
a GeoPackage If new road data gets in, the synchronization approach should not only 
take care of the new underlying road data, but needs to handle the routes data as well, 
which is usually built on top of the underlying road data. This is not a trivial problem, as 
– in particular in the enterprise world – lots of aspects are in fact layered on the base data.  

In addition to the synchronization of feature data, the synchronization of raster data might 
become a topic. Here, initial questions based on requirements need to be answered first: 
What happens if only a subset of the raster get updated? Do we restrict synchronization to 
full raster data sets? In any case, the current geosync-service is optimized for vector data. 
It does not handle map tile synchronization or raster layer sub-set synchronization yet.  

 

OWS Context 

The role of OWS Context: Is it possible to use OWS Context as it is currently defined to 
organize situation specific data source organization, i.e. to point to online and locally 
installed data sources? Does this really play a role for OGC Enabled Mobile App 
development? Though it has been discussed in OWS-9, there was general hesitance to 
develop something like a descriptive format for data source definition. Due to their 
smaller screen, touch gesture control, and mobile device sensor integration, it is more 
expected to see specialized applications rather than generic applications that could be 
loaded on demand as defined in a context document. Therefore, a proper requirements 
analysis is recommended before OWS Context is further explored. 

GeoPackage Packaging Service 

A GeoPackage service shall be developed that allows packaging data into GeoPackages. 

Security 

OWS-9 recommends running a requirements-analysis to better understand the targeted 
level of granularity and access control. For the time being, a page-level encryption 
service on the data base side (for GeoPackages) using a passphrase protection has served 
all requirements mentioned so far. Secure communication with OGC service endpoints 
can be realized by using application servers as part of the communication design. In this 
case, no changes to OGC security standards occur. Applying the full OGC security 
portfolio directly on mobile phones seems less practical. 

Branding and Accreditation 

The definition of OGC Enabled Mobile App allows the development of the two-step 
testing and accreditation process as described further below. The OGC CITE program 
could be extended.

3 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this report, the definitions specified in Clause 4 of the OWS Common 
Implementation Standard [OGC 06-121r3] shall apply. In addition, the following terms 
and definitions apply. 

3.1  
Mobile app 
Mobile applications (mobile apps) are software products developed for mobile devices, 
such as mobile phones or smart phones. These applications can be pre-installed on 
phones during manufacture, downloaded by customers from various mobile software 
distribution platforms, or delivered as web applications using server-side or client-side 
processing (e.g. JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience within a Web 
browser.

3.2  
OGC Enabled Mobile App 
The term OGC Enabled Mobile App is used to differentiate from mobile applications in 
general. A detailed definition is provided and discussed in section 5. 

3.3  
Mobile Device 
A mobile device (also known as a handheld device, handheld computer or simply 
handheld) is a small, hand-held computing device, typically having a display screen with 
touch input and/or a miniature keyboard and weighing less than 2 pounds (0.91 kg). A 
handheld computing device has an operating system (OS), and can run various types of 
application software, known as apps. Most hand held devices can also be equipped with 
WI-FI, Bluetooth and GPS capabilities that can allow connections to the Internet and 
other Bluetooth capable devices. (Wikipedia, 12/2012).

5 Management Summary 

OWS-9 produced a very vivid discussion on the nature of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps, 
resulting in a clear definition (see clause 6.1), an integration into the OGC architecture, 
usage scenarios, and a detailed description on future work items. After several months, 
agreement has been reached on most aspects. Saying that, it has to be emphasized that the 
OWS-9 innovation thread/mobile applications group followed a rather pragmatic 
approach, means that only requirements resulting from group members’ other projects 
have been brought to the table.  Requirements à la “I could imagine that” have not been 
taken into account. In summary, OGC Enabled Mobile Apps are characterized as follows: 

 OGC Enabled Mobile Apps do not require any change to existing data serving 
Web service interfaces, such as WMS, WMTS, WFS, WCS, SOS, etc. 

 OGC Enabled Mobile Apps do not require any change to existing processing Web 
service interfaces, such as WPS or SPS. 

 OGC Enabled Mobile Apps may require changes to synchronization services to 
handle vector, raster, and tile date in all situations of varying and potentially 
intermittent connectivity   



OGC 12-119r1

 OGC Enabled Mobile Apps behave in REST-ful architectures the same way as 
desktop applications 

 The smaller screen size leaves less room to render versatile messages retrieved 
from a server, e.g. GetCapabilities responses, but this remains an implementation 
detail less relevant to standardization activities 

 GeoPackage is a central new piece to the architecture, as it enables working 
offline (map cache, locally collected/updated data, essential data needed to 
support working in the field) and serves as a cache for deferred synchronization 

The following aspects express more general impressions and anticipations, rather than 
being hard facts about OGC Enabled Mobile Apps. Nevertheless, they provide valuable 
insight into the modern approach of designing, developing, and using OGC Enabled 
Mobile Apps in OGC architectures.  

 We see a paradigm shift: Away from ever enriching the server side interfaces and 
data exchange encodings towards more emphasize on the client side and protocol 
simplification 

 OGC Enabled Mobile App to application server communication becomes an 
essential part of OGC Enabled Mobile App architectures that facilitates lots of 
communication, client role handling, billing, security, etc.  

 It is anticipated that the nature of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps is less explorative 
(in terms of what is available), but rather a production oriented 

 It is more likely to find five OGC Enabled Mobile Apps running on the same 
device than a one-app-fits-all situations 

6 OGC Enabled Mobile Applications 

6.1 Definition 

An OGC Enabled Mobile App runs on a mobile operating system; has a user 
interface optimized for a touch screen on a mobile device; utilizes the device's 
sensors as contextual input; implements one or more OGC services and/or data 
container specifications; and visualizes or updates those data. 

The definition of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps given above emphasizes the key 
characteristics of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps. Whereas the first part applies to almost all 
mobile apps that are currently available, the second part addresses OGC specific aspects, 
as there are the visualization and potential modification of data either served by OGC 
services or OGC data containers.  

OWS-9 has produced long discussions about what aspects shall be relevant for OGC as a 
standardization organization, and which aspects are implementation specific and shall not 
be addressed by OGC. Those discussions resulted in the definition provided above, and 
highlight the fact that an OGC Enabled Mobile App is seen as a client application that 



OGC 12-119r1 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 7 
 

operates within the OGC architecture framework. If those requirements are fulfilled, an 
app shall be labeled OGC Enabled Mobile App.  

One of the key differences between mobile apps and desktop apps is the connectivity 
between the client application and distributed data sources. Whereas desktop applications 
are usually developed under the premises of continuous connectivity to the Internet and 
subsequently their distributed data sources, mobile applications have to deal with 
intermittent connectivity and potentially high communication costs.  

6.2 Role in the OGC Architecture 

The following architectural sketches illustrate the role of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps 
within infrastructures implemented using the OGC standards portfolio. In summary, OGC 
Enabled Mobile App fit well into existing spatial data infrastructures. They do not require 
modifications to existing systems, and still provide the advantage that continuous 
connectivity to other services is not required any longer. This is realized by combining 
HTTP based Web service communication with in-file data storage, implemented as OGC 
GeoPackage. An OGC Enabled Mobile App may support any number of additional 
features, such as communication with remote Web services, application servers, or data 
stores using proprietary protocols, or access and manipulation of locally stored 
proprietary data files or data bases. 

 

Figure 1: Role of OGC Enabled Mobile App in the OGC Architecture 

Any OGC Enabled Mobile App shall at least support the communication with OGC Web 
services, or with OGC data containers such as GeoPackage. The app interacts with those 
services/formats and makes the data available to the user. OGC Enabled Mobile Apps 
cover the full range from locally installed data usage up to fully synchronized Web 
service communication in intermittent connectivity scenarios.  

6.3 Access to Data 

6.3.1 Data Made Available at OGC Web Service Interfaces 

In the simplest scenario, the OGC Enabled Mobile App accesses OGC standards 
compliant Web services such as WMS, WFS, WMTS, etc. according to the various OGC 
standards. The app communicates with those Web services either directly or via an 
application server.

Figure 2: OGC Enabled Mobile App to OGC Web service communication 

The communication between the OGC Enabled Mobile App and the application server 
might use OGC standards compliant or proprietary protocols. At this stage, the OGC 
Enabled Mobile App definition is slightly stretched, as an app is still called OGC Enabled 
Mobile App, even if the communication to OGC Web services uses proprietary protocols 
on the app to application server communication leg.  

The OGC Enabled Mobile App may include the links to the Web services or application 
servers by default; provides a list of potentially linked services, or allows the user to add 
additional services manually. Analogue to traditional spatial data infrastructures, the 
OGC Enabled Mobile App may make use of catalogue services. Due to the limited screen 
size and the resulting exploration experiences, catalogue interfaces shall provide small-
screen optimized result representation. Practically, it is currently expected that this 
approach will only play a minor role in service discovery. 

6.3.2 Local Data 

OGC Enabled Mobile App can use data stored locally on the mobile device, if the data is 
compliant with OGC container formats. Theoretically, an OGC Enabled Mobile App may 
access data served by a locally installed Web service. Practically, performance aspects 
will most likely negate such a solution.

If on-device data handling is supported, then OGC Enabled Mobile Apps shall support 
the data container format GeoPackage (see OGC 12-128r1, OpenGIS® GeoPackage 
Implementation Specification). 

6.3.3 Combined Local and Remotely Available Data 

OGC Enabled Mobile App may integrate both solutions described above. This most 
complex form supports scenarios with intermittent connectivity. 

 

Figure 4: OGC Enabled Mobile App combined data handling 

As long as connectivity and bandwidth allow, the OGC Enabled Mobile App uses 
remotely stored data. If the connection gets interrupted, the app switches to the locally 
stored data and optionally synchronizes as soon as connectivity is reestablished.  

6.4 OGC Enabled Mobile App Deployment & Discovery 

Mobile apps as products are already well established and matured outside of the OGC 
realm. Usually, the different operating system providers operate different flavors of app 
stores allowing discovery, deployment and maintenance of mobile apps. Among the most 
important app stores, there is the Google Play Store for Android, the Apple App Store for 
iOS, the Windows Store for Windows 8 and Windows RT, the Blackberry App World for 
BlackBerry OS, and a number of stores operated by the mobile device manufacturers. 
Essentially, all stores follow the same principle, including catalogues and browsing 
platforms for app discovery as well as app updating mechanisms. Any OGC Enabled 
Mobile App will be distributed either using an app store, directly by the software 
developer, or using proprietary mechanisms in case of enterprise device management.

Figure 5: Deployment options for OGC Enabled Mobile Apps 

In the first case, the OGC Enabled Mobile App will be registered in the app store by the 
developer similar to any other non-OGC app. Following standard app store procedures, 
the user can discover, (purchase), download and install the OGC Enabled Mobile App.  

In the second case, the software developer provides a download link to the user. Users 
can use this link to download and install the OGC Enabled Mobile App locally. In this 
case, the exact procedure differs slightly form operating system to operating system. 
Some operating systems do not support manual app installation in general. Alternatively, 
app (and data) are provided on a memory card. The installation procedure remains the 
same, just that the download link points to a local resource.   

In case of enterprise device management, the device is controlled by a central device 
management system. Once connected to the private network, the device manager takes 
over control and deploys software and data. The following use case diagrams illustrate 
the potential solutions.  

6.4.1 App Store 

The first use case illustrates the most common scenario for personal use. The user 
explores the apps provided by the app store using app store exploration tools and selects 
the identified OGC Enabled Mobile App. This process can be controlled either using the 
mobile device or a Web-based browsing platform optimized for larger screens.

Figure 6: OGC Enabled Mobile App discovery and deployment, app store scenario 

Following the app store procedures, the app will be downloaded and automatically 
installed on the local device. All modern devices support automated checks for updates, 
which could be downloaded and installed upon user confirmation. OWS-9 participants 
disliked the idea of a dedicated OGC App Store, as the various stores already provide all 
required functionality.  

The app stores with their in-built evaluation and commenting system helps dealing with 
trust issues as well. All OS-providers have their specific approach to authenticate app 
developers. For example, Android requires developers to sign their code. Android code 
signing usually uses self-signed certificates, which developers can generate without 
anyone else’s assistance or permission. One reason for code signing is to allow 
developers to update their application without creating complicated interfaces and 
permissions. Applications signed with the same key (and therefore by the same 
developer) can ask to run with the same UID. This allows developers to upgrade or patch 
their software easily, including copying data from existing versions. The signing is 
different than normal Jar or Authenticode signing however, as the actual identity of the 
developer isn’t necessarily being validated by a third party to the device’s user. 
Developers earn a good reputation by making good products; their certificates prove 
authorship of their works. [Burns 2008] 

6.4.2 Manual Download 

The second scenario circumvents the app store. The software developer makes the app 
available to the user by offering the installation file on the Internet or on a memory card.

Figure 7: Use case direct app download 

The user discovers the app by using a search engine or by retrieval of the download link. 
The installation file will be downloaded and installed. Currently, the operating systems 
do not support regular update checks for apps manually installed. The user has to initiate 
those checks manually if the software does not have an in-built update handler. Updates 
can be provided by the software developer simply by making new versions of the 
software available on the Internet.  

6.4.3 Enterprise Device Management 

In the third scenario, the user does not have direct control over the mobile device. 
Instead, the device gets managed by a device management system, which is usually 
operating on the private company network.

Figure 8: Use Case Enterprise Device Manager 

The user simply connects the device to the network. All app and data installation and 
updating will be handled by the enterprise device manager. The user may has the option 
to select software and data, or is provided with software and data depending on his 
specific mission or role in the company.  

6.5 Data Access & Data Loading 

6.5.1 Local Data 

OGC Enabled Mobile Apps can access data stored locally on the mobile devices as well 
as data made available on the Internet. Locally stored data shall be provided in the form 
of GeoPackages. The OGC GeoPackage specification ensures that spatial feature data, 
tiles, and raster data gets in and out of a data container consistently. An OGC Enabled 
Mobile App may support access to a single or to many GeoPackages. Data sets, packaged 
as GeoPackage can optionally be 

 Downloaded directly together with the OGC Enabled Mobile App during initial 
install,  

 Referenced from within the OGC Enabled Mobile App and downloaded on 
demand, 

 Made available on the Internet and downloaded using third party tools and 
eventually manually linked to the OGC Enabled Mobile App, 

 Deployed using an enterprise mobile device management system 

As handling multiple GeoPackages on a single device causes more management 
overhead than a single GeoPackage, an interesting option is the GeoPackage on demand 
server. This server allows defining the individual data sets that will be packed into the on-
demand generated GeoPackage.

Figure 9: Use Case GeoPackage Packaging Server 

During the order process, the user defines the required data sets to be contained in the 
GeoPackage. The GeoPackage server generates the GeoPackage, which will be made 
available to the user. As the generation of the GeoPackage might be a time consuming 
task, asynchronous communication between the user and the GeoPackage server is 
recommended.  

6.5.2 Data Provided at OGC Web Service Interfaces 

Any OGC Enabled Mobile App may communicate with other OGC Web services. This 
communication does not differ from desktop-based applications communicating with 
OGC Web services. The following Web services have been analyzed: WMS, WMTS, 
WFS, WCS, SOS, WPS, and SPS. The analysis checked all operations defined in the 
various standards for specific characteristics of mobile applications that would require 
changes to the standards. 

6.6 Usage, Editing & Synchronization 

In the editing phase, the user uses the app to add additional data items to either the local 
data store or an online source. Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) support is 
important for a wide range of scenarios.  

On a mobile device, there might be any number of GeoPackages. It has been agreed that 
it will be impossible to integrate GeoPackages provided by different providers into a 
single GeoPackage. Though a GeoPackage server can integrate different data sets into a 
single GeoPackage (and therefore ensures an easy to manage single package on the 
device situation), GeoPackages will rather stand for themselves once created. It is general 
consensus among OWS-9 participants that it will be impossible to get sufficient 
coordination between GeoPackage providers to create one super GeoPackage that 



OGC 12-119r1 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 15 
 

contains all data of all providers. Experiences made during past attempts to create 
something like a merge operation between any number of data containers have proven 
that merging data containers is a very complex task that can barely be handled by a 
standard covering a wide portfolio of situations. If the GeoPackages allow, updates shall 
be handled in all affected GeoPackages. 

For OWS-9, it was agreed that creation, updating, and deletion of items only applies to 
feature data, not to any raster or tile data. Though in future, it is imaginable that a user 
has additional sensors, models, or other technology at hand that allow creating data that 
should be added to existing tile or raster data sets. For example, the camera of a phone 
may create an image or stream of images that get tiled on the fly and should be added to 
an existing tile data source; or the user makes a number of observations in the field, runs 
an interpolation model and updates an existing raster data source.  

The current synchronization pattern, which is used for example by the geo-
synchronization service (and applies to vector data exclusively), foresees changes to be 
made on the device to get forwarded to the sync service in order to update the original 
service.  

Keeping track of new or changed items compared to the original data in a remote data 
store is another effort that becomes necessary in case that data needs to be synchronized 
in chunks due to limited bandwidth or even intermitted connectivity. There are different 
options to support this capability. Either the GeoPackage would contain the necessary 
aspects to support this functionality, or a separate sync service in combination with a 
dedicated data format is used. There is a preference of the latter, though this aspect 
requires further discussion. Keeping all potential synchronization scenarios in line is 
subject to another testbed, as a range of single and multiple user as well as low and high 
bandwidth scenarios have to be differentiated. 

 

 

7 Usage Scenarios 

The usage scenarios illustrate the potential usage of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps by three 
different types of users: The general user, the power user, and the expert. The purpose of 
this clause is to understand OGC Enabled Mobile Apps from the user’s point of view.  

Simplicity is key for the general user. The user uses the app store exploration software 
provided by the app store operator to discover the app, downloads and installs it, and 
starts using it. Either the data required to operate the app has been downloaded during the 
initial install, or the app features online access to data. In both cases, the general user is 
not even aware of the fact that the app is an OGC Enabled Mobile App that corresponds 
with OGC compliance servers and/or makes use of a local data container such as 
GeoPackage. Updates to feature data sets get communicated directly to the server in 
online mode, whereas no synchronization is supported without connectivity.  



OGC 12-119r1

The power user understands the general principles about data containers for map tiles, 
raster and feature data. This user selects the required data sets either by using OGC 
Enabled Mobile App’s capabilities, or uses a third party data generation tool to package 
all required data into one or many data containers. Once generated, the user loads the data 
and links it to the OGC Enabled Mobile App. The OGC Enabled Mobile App may 
support offline update caching and full two-way synchronization.  

The third type of user is the expert. This type is rather the developer than the user of 
OGC Enabled Mobile Apps. The user can manipulate data containers directly issuing 
SQL commands and interacts with OGC Web services on the command line. This user is 
not addressed here any further. 

8 Further Aspects 

8.1 Certification 

Certification of OGC Enabled Mobile Apps is a two-step process, as OGC Enabled 
Mobile Apps may be optimized for a specific subset of OGC Web services or data 
containers. Therefore, standard compliancy of the service or container has to be ensured 
first, then the communication between the OGC Enabled Mobile App and the 
service/container will be tested. If both work well, certification could be credited.  

8.2 Security 

This section discusses security and privacy aspects on a platform independent level. It 
does not address aspects that are specific to any particular operating system. A detailed 
analysis of the security models of the various platforms needs to be subject of future 
initiatives if necessary. 

There are two main categories of mobile application risks. The category of malicious 
functionality is a list of unwanted and dangerous behaviors that are stealthily placed in a 
Trojan app that the user is tricked into installing. Instead of installing the intended 
software, users get hidden spyware, phishing UI, or other malicious functionality instead, 
such as: 

 Activity monitoring and data retrieval 
 Unauthorized dialing, SMS, and payments 
 Unauthorized network connectivity (exfiltration or command & control) 
 UI Impersonation 
 System modification (rootkit, APN proxy configuration) 
 Logic or time bomb 

The category of vulnerabilities includes errors in design or implementation that expose 
the mobile device data to interception and retrieval by attackers. Vulnerabilities can also 
expose the mobile device or remotely provided applications used from the device to 
unauthorized access.  



OGC 12-119r1

 Sensitive data leakage (inadvertent or side channel) 
 Unsafe sensitive data storage 
 Unsafe sensitive data transmission 
 Hardcoded password/keys 

It can be stated that in general, the same concepts apply as for non-mobile applications. 
In OWS-9, we tested a SQLite based page-level encryption library called SQL cipher. 
“SQLCipher is a security extension to the SQLite database platform that facilitates the 
creation of encrypted databases. It uses the internal SQLite Codec API to insert a 
callback into the pager system that can operate on database pages immediately before 
they are written to and read from storage” (http://sqlcipher.net). SQL cipher worked well 
in combination with GeoPackage files. 

To better understand the security requirements for mobile devices, a full requirements 
analysis becomes necessary. Though a number of potential situations can be imagined, it 
was general consensus among OWS-9 participants that a wide range of typical security 
aspects can be covered by using a page level encryption mechanism with a pass phrase 
that needs to be provided by the user. Additional role-based authorization settings are 
often better handled in system designs featuring application servers as part of the 
communication chain between mobile apps and Web services.  

8.3 File Size of Local Files 

Currently, the maximum file size is often limited to 4GB on many devices due to 
constraints set by the file system used on the mobile device, which makes the case for 
multiple data packages on a single device. In the future, if exFAT or other file systems 
will be used more widespread, this limitation will go away. exFAT (Extended File 
Allocation Table) is a proprietary file system designed especially for flash drives. It is 
used in cases where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution, due to data structure 
overhead, or where the file size limit of the standard FAT32 file system (without FAT+ 
extension, the limit is 4GB) is unacceptable. exFAT has a recommended maximal disk 
size of 512 TB, though the theoretical max is 64 ZB and a maximal file size of 16 EB. 
The Android operating system version 4 makes use of exFAT, for example.
