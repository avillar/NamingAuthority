i. Abstract 
This OGC® Best Practices document specifies the interfaces, bindings, requirements, 
conformance classes for online download of Earth Observation products. This protocol 
covers several scenarios implemented by European Space Agency - ESA for providing its 
products to users: 

 The EO Product to be downloaded is already available and can be downloaded as 
it is. 

 The EO Product is not online available but is stored in a near online archive. 
 The EO Product is advertised in a Catalogue, but it is not physically available and 

it has to be generated on the fly by a processing facility. 
 The EO product is archived in several distributed online archives and it can be 

downloaded in parallel. 

The basic scenarios can be simply supported by Web Browsers, the most complex ones 
need a dedicated client (download manager) supporting Metalink and multisource 
download. 

This Best Practice document has been prepared basing on the work performed in the 
frame of ESA’s Next Generation Earth Observation user services and it was initially 
produced during the ESA HMA (Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility) initiative [OR1] 
and related projects.

iii. Preface 
This Best Practice document summarizes the scenarios implemented by European Space 
Agency – ESA for supplying its products to the users. These scenarios cover different 
needs of different Satellite’s missions, and then they have been taken into account in 
separated requirements & conformance classes. In this way the developers can choose the 
conformance class that fits their needs without mandating the compliance with all 
requirements. 

Actually two requirements classes have been defined, distinguishing between Download 
Servers dealing with already available products (Core class) and other servers supporting 
on-the-fly production (On-Demand Download class). 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held 
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

1. Scope 

This OGC® Best Practices document specifies the interfaces, bindings, requirements, 
conformance classes for online download of Earth Observation products.  

This document describes several ways for downloading EO Products starting from their 
HTTP URLs generally retrieved from an EO Product Catalogue.  

Basically it distinguishes between 2 cases: 

 The product is already physically on-line available for download; 
 The product is NOT already physically on-line available (for various reasons e.g. 

the product has to be retrieved from an Offline archive, or it has to be generated 
from ancillary data). 

Additionally, in both cases, the following alternatives are supported: 

 Product file is available from multiple sources (parallel download); 
 The product is composed of multiple files, each possibly available from multiple 

sources (multiple download); 
 The product file is reachable via several HTTP redirections from the original 

URL. 
 Any combination of previous alternatives. 

The protocol uses: 

 HTTP GET for all interactions; 
 HTTP redirections, in case of “virtual URL”; 
 Re-try mechanism according to specific HTTP returned codes, in case of on-

demand / off-line products; 
 Metalink files for managing the multi-file / multi source download.

2. Conformance 

Two Requirements and Conformance classes have been defined: 

 Core, regrouping all requirements for supporting download of already available 
EO Products including: multi file download, multi source download, and 
redirection. 

 On-Demand Download, inheriting from Core class and adding the requirements 
for allowing download of EO product files not ready yet. 

In this way “classic” download servers supporting download of already available 
products needs to implement just the Core class, while the more advanced ones, having 
some processing capability, might implement On-Demand Download class. 

The following diagram shows the relationships between the defined Requirement 
Classes. 

 

Figure 2-1: Requirement Classes. 

The inheritance relationship between the different classes represents the inheritance of all 
requirements from the super class. E.g.: On-demand Download class defines its specific 
requirements and includes also the requirements defined in the Core class. 

The following table reports: 

o The Requirement Class name 
o the URI 
o The dependency with other requirements classes.

4. Terms and Definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in §5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is based on the 
ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International 
Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a 
requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard. 

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply. 

4.1  
dataset series (dataset collection ) 
Collection of datasets sharing the same product specification [ISO 19113, ISO 19114, 
ISO 19115]. In this context, a collection metadata record in the catalogue describes a 
collection of EO Products, typically a dataset collection corresponds to datasets (i.e. 
products) generated by a single sensor in a specific mode on a particular EO satellite. 

4.2  
EO Product 
Data product, typically stored on computer file, generated by sensors carried by Earth 
Observation Satellites. 

4.3  
identifier 
a character string that may be composed of numbers and characters that is exchanged 
between the client and the server with respect to a specific identity of a resource. 

4.4  
profile 
set of one or more base standards and - where applicable - the identification of chosen 
clauses, classes, subsets, options and parameters of those base standards that are 
necessary for accomplishing a particular function [ISO 19101, ISO 19106] 

4.5  
procedure oriented architectural style 
platform-independent design approach that is focused on operations, their parameters and 
their results, that can be defined in an abstract level specification. Concrete platform-
dependent specifications can be derived from the abstract level, allowing, for example, 
KVP or SOAP messaging. 

4.6  
product order 
Ordering request asking the processing and delivery of precisely identified EO Products. 

4.7  
resource oriented architectural style 
platform-independent design approach that is focused on resources, representations and 
actions, that can be defined in an abstract level specification. Concrete platform-



OGC 13-043

dependent specifications can be derived from the abstract level, allowing, for example, a 
RESTful architecture. 

4.8  
URL component 
text contained after the context path between two forward slashes “/”, that are not placed 
between two matching parentheses “(...)”, and before any question mark character “?” 
 

4.9  
URL component key 
text contained in an URL component that comes before an opening parenthesis “(“ 
 

4.10  
URL component value 
text contained in an URL component that is enclosed between the first opening 
parenthesis “(“ and the last closing parenthesis “)” in the → component 
 
Example In the http://example.org/component1/componentKey(componentValue), 
components are as follows: 
 Context Path: http://example.org/ 
 URL Components: component1, componentKey(componentValue)

5.2 UML notation 

5.2.1 Introduction 
Some diagrams that appear in this document are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) diagrams: 

 Class Diagrams 

Class diagrams show the static structure of the model, in particular, the things that 
exist (such as classes and types), their internal structure, and their relationships to 
other things. Class diagrams do not show temporal information, although they 
may contain occurrences of things that have or describe temporal behaviour. 

 Sequence Diagrams 

A sequence diagram shows an interaction arranged in time sequence. In 
particular, it shows the objects participating in the interaction by their “lifelines” 
and the messages that they exchange arranged in time sequence. It does not show 
the associations among the objects. 

5.2.2 UML Class Diagrams 
A class diagram is a picture providing generic descriptions of possible systems. Class 
diagrams and object diagrams are alternate representations of object models. Class 
diagrams contain classes and object diagrams contain objects, but it is possible to mix 
classes and objects when dealing with various kinds of metadata, so the separation is not 
rigid. Class diagrams contain icons representing classes, interfaces, and their 
relationships. In particular, class diagrams contain: 

 Logical Packages 

Packages purpose is to partition the logical model of a system. They are clusters 
of highly related classes that are themselves cohesive, but are loosely coupled 
with other such clusters. You can use packages to group classes, interfaces, and 
other packages. 

 Classes 



OGC 13-043

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

A class captures the common structure and common behaviour of a set of objects. 
A class is an abstraction of real-world items. When these items exist in the real 
world, they are instances of the class, and referred to as objects. 

 Interfaces 

An interface specifies the externally visible operations of a class and/or 
component, and has no implementation of its own. An interface typically specifies 
only a limited part of the behaviour of a class or component. 

 Parameterized Classes 

A parameterized class is a template for creating any number of instantiated classes 
that follow its format. It declares formal parameters. You can use other classes, 
types, and constant  expressions as parameters. You cannot use the parameterized 
class itself as a parameter. You must instantiate a parameterized class before you 
can create its objects. In its simplest form, you can use parameterized classes to 
build container classes. 

 Instantiated Classes 

An instantiated class is a class formed from a parameterized class by supplying 
actual values for parameters. It is created by supplying actual values for the 
formal parameters of the parameterized class. This instantiation process forms a 
concrete class in the family of the parameterized class. The instantiated class 
should be put at the client end of an instantiate relationship (accessible through 
the Create Entry on the Tools menu) that points to the corresponding 
parameterized class. 

 Association Relationships 

An association represents a semantic connection between two classes, or between 
a class and an interface. Associations are bi-directional; they are the most general 
relationship and also the most semantically weak. 

 Aggregate Relationship 

The aggregate relationship is used for showing a whole and part relationship 
between two classes. 

The class at the client end of the aggregate relationship is sometimes called the 
aggregate class. An instance of the aggregate class is an aggregate object. The 
class at the supplier end of the aggregate relationship is the part whose instances 
are contained or owned by the aggregate object. The aggregate relationship is 
used for showing that the aggregate object is physically constructed from other 
objects or that it logically contains another object. The aggregate object has 
ownership of its parts.

 Generalize/Inherits Relationships 

A generalize relationship between classes shows that the subclass shares the 
structure or behaviour defined in one or more super-classes. Use a generalize 
relationship to show an "is- a" relationship between classes. 

 Instantiates Relationships 

An instantiates relationship represents the act of substituting actual values for the 
parameters of a parameterized class or parameterized class utility to create a 
specialized version of the more general item. In most cases, you will also draw a 
uses relationship between the instantiated class and another concrete class that is 
used as an actual parameter. 

 Dependency Relationships 

Draw a dependency relationship between two classes, or between a class and an 
interface, to show that the client class depends on the supplier class/interface to 
provide certain services, such as: 

o The client class accesses a value (constant or variable) defined in the 
supplier class/interface. 

o Operations of the client class invoke operations of the supplier 
class/interface. 

o Operations of the client class have signatures whose return class or 
arguments are instances of the supplier class/interface. 

The next picture shows the items just explained.

Each interaction between objects is the activation of an operation of an object, which 
includes input and output parameters. 

5.3 XML notation 
Most diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using an XML schema 
notation defined by the XMLSpy tool and described in this sub-clause.  

Hereafter the symbols defined in the XML schema notation are described: 

o Optional single element without child elements 

  

o Optional single element with child elements 

  

o Mandatory single element. 

  

o Mandatory multiple element containing child elements. This element must occur 
at least once (Minimum Occurrence = 1) and may occur as often as desired 
(Maximum Occurrence = unbounded). 

  

o Mandatory single element with containing simple content (e.g. text) or mixed 
complex content (e.g. text with xhtml markup).

o A sequence of elements. The elements must appear exactly in the sequence in 
which they appear in the schema diagram. 

  

o A choice of elements. Only a single element from those in the choice may appear 
at this position. 

  

o Types. If an element refers to a complex global type, the type is shown with a 
border and yellow background. 

  

o Complex Type. The following figure illustrates the use of a complex type for 
defining an XML element 

  

5.4 Data dictionary tables 
The XML data dictionary used to describe the parameters within this document is 
specified herein in a series of tables. The contents of the columns in these tables are 
described in Table 5-1. 

	  



OGC 13-043 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Column title Column contents 
Names  
(left column) 

Name of the XML element to describe. 

The name uses the XML encoding capitalization specified in Sub-clause 
11.6.2 of [OGC 05-008]. The name capitalization rules used are specified in 
Sub-clause 11.6.2 of [OGC 05-008]. Some names in the tables may appear to 
contain spaces, but no names contain spaces. 

Definition  
(second column) 

Specifies the definition of this element.  

Data type and 
value  
(third column) 
 

Normally contains two items: 

The mandatory first item is often the data type used for this parameter, using 
data types appropriate in the model, in which this parameter is a named 
attribute of a XML entity. Alternately, the first item can identify the data 
structure (or class) referenced by this association, and references a separate 
table used to specify the contents of that class (or data structure). 

The optional second item in the third column of each table should indicate 
the source of values for this parameter, the alternative values, or other value 
information, unless the values are quite clear from other listed information. 

Multiplicity and 
use  
(fourth column) 
 

Normally contains two items: 

The item specifies the multiplicity and optionality of this parameter in this 
data structure, either “One (mandatory)”, “One or more (mandatory)”, “Zero 
or one (optional)”, or “Zero or more (optional)”. 

If it needs to describe the multiplicity of an XML choice element, it needs to 
use the word “mandatory/choice” and “optional/choice”. The choice element 
in fact provides an XML representation for describing a single selection from 
a set of element types where each selection item can be defined ‘mandatory’. 

Table 5-1: Contents of data dictionary tables. 

When the data type used for a parameter, in the third column of such a table, is another 
complex type, all the values must be specified and listed, together with the meaning of 
each value. When this information is extensive, these values and meanings are specified 
in a separated table and a cross reference to it is put in the table. 

6. Download Service for Earth Observation Products (DSEO) Overview 

As highlighted in the introduction sections, this document provides a simple interface for 
downloading EO Products available in two different ways: 



OGC 13-043 
 

25 
Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 Immediate Product access: the requested product, specified by submitted URI, is 
on-line and ready for access. 

 On-Demand Download: this type of request triggers an on-demand generation of 
the desired product. This option is used also when the requested product is 
available in off-line archive and the Download Server needs time to retrieve and 
restore it to on-line availability. 

6.1 Protocol Operations 
This specification is composed of the following operations: 

 GetCapabilities, which allows a client to receive service metadata (Capabilities 
document) that describes the abilities of the specific server (see §8.1). 

 GetProduct, which allows a client to request a specified Product providing its 
unique URI (see §8.2). The server returns different responses in case the 
requested product is on-line (directly available / available on another 
dissemination server / Metalink download) or off-line / on-demand generated 
(retry later to check product availability).

with a specific product URI). 

 The Download Server checks for the on-line availability of the product. 
o If the product is on-line available, there are the following sub-cases: 

 The product is returned as byte stream. 
 The product is online, but at different site: the Download Server 

returns a forwarded download message where the alternative 
location of the requested product is specified. The client will 
download the product form the re-directed server. 

 The product is online, but composed of multiple files: the 
Download Server sends back a Metalink XML file. The Client will 
parse the Metalink to obtain all the items that are part of the 
requested product. This sub-case is detailed in §6.2.1.1. 

o If the product is missing the Download Server returns a Missing Product 
exception message. 

o If the request is invalid (the submitted request is not well formed, etc.) the 
Download Server returns a Bad Request exception message.

 The client asks to the Download Server to retrieve a product with specified URI 
(GetProduct). 

 The Download Server internally checks if the specified product is available in on-
line storage. The product is on-line available and it is composed of multiple files 
so the Download Server returns a Metalink XML file. 

A Metalink is an XML file where the various items composing the EO Product 
are listed and the possible sources are specified as well. Major details can be 
found on section §7.1.  

 On Client side, the Metalink response message triggers the parsing of the file. For 
each item composing the product, one or more sub-URIs is defined. 

 Each sub-URI is retrieved from the Client by an HTTP GET request: 
o In case the requested item has one source, then it is directly downloaded. 
o In case the requested item has two or more sources (e.g. item #2 is 

currently available both from main Download Server and from Download 
Server #2) then, depending on Client capability, a parallel download can 
be performed. The client sends a GetProduct request to each server asking 
for a byte range of the product. Each server sends back the partial content. 

When the client has received all trunks, then merge them rebuilding the 
whole file.

7. Shared Aspects 

7.1 Metalink 

7.1.1 Introduction 
An EO Product is generally an image of a certain earth surface area. In some cases a 
product can also include metadata such as: image description, telemetry-related data, 
sensor information and so on.  
All items of a product are usually managed as single files (e.g. ENVISAT products or the 
ones in the Earth Explorer format stored as single TAR files) and in this way they can be 
downloaded starting directly from a dedicated Product URI. Special considerations have 
to be taken into account in the case the product is composed of several files (e.g. in the 
case of SAFE products) or the product can be downloaded in parallel from different 
sources. In these cases Metalink files are an appropriate solution. 
A Metalink is an xml file that refers to other files by their HTTP URLs. It is a description 
of a collection of files, each file being potentially another Metalink file referencing 
another sub-collection of files.  
Several clients have already a built-in support for Metalink, but in general to enable 
download via Metalink a plug-in must be installed. 

7.1.2 Multiple-file Product 
As per HTTP protocol, from a single URL a client can get a single byte stream, which 
means that from a single URL only a single file can be retrieved. 
In case the download is composed of multiple files, the following options arise: 

 The different files are packed together in a single archive file. 
 The download is performed via processing a Metalink file referencing the URLs 

of all items composing the complete download. 
The first solution is not suitable when the product files are not already archived in a 
single file, but must be packed at run time. In this case the Metalink file download 
solution recommended. 

7.1.3 Parallel Download 
Another scenario where Metalink files are very useful is when the product files are 
replicated on different storage locations. In this case the various replica of the same 
product can be referred from the Metalink and then a client can activate the download in 
parallel from the various sources improving the download bandwidth and also the 
reliability of the download process. 

7.1.4 Metalink XSD Schema 
In this section we briefly describe the Metalink XSD schema focusing on the main 
aspects of this representation which we use in this document, leaving all the details to its 
reference [NR14].

OGC 13-043

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

As shown in Figure 7-1, the Metalink data structure is composed of two major xml 
elements: 

 Files: in this section the Metalink regroups all items composing a product with 
one file entry for each item. Each file contains one or more resource object type 
(described below) and a series of elements and attributes better described in 
[NR14]. 

 Resources: in this sub-section the Metalink structure describes all the resources 
that have a local copy of the item-related file. Each resource is described by a 
URL to the requested file. See [NR14] for details. 

7.1.5 Metalink example 
In this section we provide a Metalink response example for an EO product composed of 
two items with multiple sources. 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<metalink xmlns=http://www.metalinker.org/ 
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.metalinker.org/schema/3.0/metalink.xsd"> 
<files> 
  <file name="product.SAFE/manifest.mf"> 
    <copyright>European Space Agency</copyright> 
    <resources> 
      <url type="http">http://DSEOServer/product.SAFE?file=manifest</url> 
      <url type="http">http://DSEOServer_bis/product.SAFE?file=manifest</url> 
    </resources> 
  </file> 
  <file name="product.SAFE/image.jp2"> 
    <copyright>European Space Agency</copyright> 
    <resources> 
      <url type="http">http://DSEOServer/product.SAFE?file=image</url> 
      <url type="http">http://DSEOServer_bis/product.SAFE?file=image</url> 
    </resources> 
  </file> 
</files> 
</metalink> 

 
As shown in the example above we have one EO product called “product.SAFE” which 
is composed of two items (two file XML elements): “manifest.mf”, a manifest file and 
“image.jp2” a JPEG2000 image file. Each item is currently available from two different 
locations (a resource XML element for each file with two url XML element) that makes 
the file available from two different Download Servers (in this case DSEOServer and 
DSEOServer_bis).

8. DSEO Operations 

DSEO service operations supports Key-Value Pairs (KVP) encoding and then their 
parameters are set as list of key value pairs over HTTP GET requests. 
Each pair is defined using the name of the parameter followed by an equals sign, '=', 
followed by the value given to the parameter, for example 
"productURI=http://www.example.org/product1".  
In HTTP GET messages, the KVP lists are part of the URL.  

8.1 GetCapabilities 
The GetCapabilities operation allows clients to retrieve service metadata from a server. 
The response to a GetCapabilities request shall be an XML document containing service 
metadata about the server, including specific information about the DSEO server.  

This section specifies the request parameters and the XML document that a DSEO server 
must return to describe its capabilities.

8.1.3 GetCapabilities response exceptions 
When a DSEO Server encounters an error while performing a GetCapabilities operation, 
it SHALL return an exception-report message as specified in §8 of OWS Common [OGC 
06-121r3]. Then it returns an HTTP response including: 
 

 HTTP Status Code: 4XX for errors on the client side; 5XX for errors on server 
side.  

 HTTP Entity Body: ows:ExceptionReport element set as specified in §8 of [NR7]. 

The following table reports the possible error conditions with the defined HTTP 
responses.

8.2.2 GetProduct operation response 
As explained in section §6.2, different responses are possible depending on the 
availability of the product (on-line / non on line) and on the server capability (Metalink 
download, forwarded download). 
The following table reports the possible responses, all based on standard HTTP protocol:

Table 8-6: GetProduct operation responses. 

8.2.2.1 Direct Download response 
The EO Product is on-line, either because it is an as-it-is product or because has been 
moved on-line after a transfer from off-line or on-demand processing has been

completed. It is sent back to the client as a byte-stream directly from the invoked DSEO 
Server. 

8.2.2.2 Metalink Download response 
The requested EO Product is composed of several files and, for different reasons (e.g. for 
performances or bandwidth restrictions), cannot be downloaded as a single file. A 
Metalink file is generated by the Download Server which provides the product file tree 
structure and the relevant sub-URI’s. The use of parallel download is suggested to 
retrieve the entire product quickly. Metalink files can also be used by the Download 
Server to indicate that the product is available from different locations. See §7.1 for 
further details on Metalink structure and examples. 

8.2.2.3 Accepted Download response 
The request is valid but the product is still not available for the download. This happens 
when the product is either off-line or needs on-demand processing.  

The following figure provides a graphical representation of the DSEO Accepted 
Download Response element.

11. Annex A (Normative): Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite 

This section describes the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) of the  

OGC Download Service for Earth Observation Products.  

An ATS provides a basis for developing an executable test suite (ETS) to verify that an 
Implementation Under Test (IUT) conforms to all relevant functional specifications. 

A number of Conformance classes have been defined for verifying the various 
Requirement classes defined in this specification: 

 Core conformance class, regrouping all tests for verifying Core class 
requirements; 

 On-demand Download, regrouping all tests for verifying On-demand Download 
class requirements. 

A conformance class is implemented via a set of Conformance Tests, each testing one or 
more requirements of the corresponding Requirements Class.
