i. Abstract 
Creating modern geospatial terrain standards has proven to be a challenge for the 
modeling and simulation (M&S) industry.  Multiple standards have promised to be a 
panacea for all; but few, if any, have delivered on the promises.  Challenges facing new 
geospatial terrain standards have included proprietary formats, rarely used data 
containers, obsolescence, disconnected data silos, and heavy reliance of Government 
funding and management.  While much effort has gone into developing new formats, the 
most common used formats are based on antiquated concepts with proprietary limitations.  
These ageing formats are a hindrance to terrain data reuse, runtime terrain database 
correlation, innovation, and system interoperability.   

In the commercial industry, geospatial data content and use is exploding at a rate that is 
outpacing the innovation and utilization of the traditional M&S industry.  The M&S and 
geospatial-intelligence (GEOINT) industries are on a path of convergence.  The Open 
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is a key forum influencing and facilitating this unification 
process.  Within the OGC, there are two geospatial standards that best enable the 
unification of the M&S and GEOINT industries: OGC CDB and GeoPackage.  OGC 
CDB and GeoPackage are both standards increasingly used in M&S and GEOINT 
industry, but they both contain weaknesses and strengths when it comes to the combined 
needs of both industries. 

This paper offers the results of research, design, and prototype efforts to present the OGC 
standards working group an approach to creating “GeoCDB”—a technology mashing of 
GeoPackage and OGC CDB—as a deterministic repository of easily read data geospatial 
datasets suitable for storage, runtime access, and dissemination for live, virtual, 
constructive, gaming, and mission command (MC) systems.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Creating modern geospatial terrain standards has proven to be a challenge for the 
modeling and simulation (M&S) industry.  Multiple standards have promised to be a 
panacea for all; but few, if any, have delivered on the promises.  Challenges facing new 
geospatial terrain standards have included proprietary formats, rarely used data 
containers, obsolescence, disconnected data silos, and heavy reliance of Government 
funding and management.  While much effort has gone into developing new formats, the 
most common used formats are based on antiquated concepts with proprietary limitations.  
These ageing formats are a hindrance to terrain data reuse, runtime terrain database 
correlation, innovation, and system interoperability.   

The Joint Staff J7 and Army Geospatial Center (AGC) share a common objective to 
adopt a standardized terrain format.  In the past, Joint and Service simulation training 
capabilities adopted or developed differing standards, often in isolation, tailored to their 
specific training needs (Chambers and Callaway, 2017).  This has resulted in costly 
integration efforts to link simulation-training capabilities together in federations.   

An advantage to the Open Geospatial Consortium is that standards working groups 
actively manage and update those standards in a cooperative fashion, leveraging the 
synergy of the key Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence community members, 
along with industry and academia. 

Freeman (2017) described alternative deployment techniques in CDB that include 
leveraging GeoPackage. 

The Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE) stood up a Terrain Data Standards for 
Joint Training working group to address the need for a “cooperative establishment of a 
joint training standard or specification for the encoding, storage, access, and modification 
of a representation of the natural and man-made terrain for virtual and constructive 
simulation applications” (Chambers and Callaway, 2017).  The mid-term 
recommendations included a common library framework and standardized attributes, 
while the long-term recommendations included defining a common storage format for 
terrain data by 2021.  The long-term recommendations included the ability to modify the 
common standard to meet unfulfilled requirements.  The working group paper also 
compared four existing terrain database standards, CDB, the Synthetic Environment Core 
(SE Core) Master Database (MDB), the Air Force Common Dataset (AFCD), and the 
NAVAIR Portable Source Initiative (NPSI).  Although the standards have much in 
common, the paper identified CDB as a potential candidate due to a variety of reasons, 
but primarily because it was 1) an open OGC international standard and 2) it supports 
storage and runtime applications.   

Although the Service, Agency, and Combatant Command representatives at the Joint 
Training Synchronization Conference approved the JTSE white paper, when the OGC 
CDB v1.0 was nominated for entry into the Defense Information Technology Standards 
Registry (DISR) as an emerging standard, the U.S. Army Modeling & Simulation 
Enterprise raised some concerns with the CDB standard.  The key technical concern of 
the standard was that it incorporated two formats, Esri Shapefiles and Presagis 
OpenFlight, which although they are open specifications, were initially developed as 



2

proprietary formats.  In addition, Shapefiles were introduced in the early 1990s, and 
leverage the dBase IV format to store feature attribution.  The use of dBase IV limits the 
ability of OGC CDB v1.0 to adopt the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence 
(NSG) Application Schema (NAS) version 1.8 profile.  The key limitation is that only 10 
characters can be stored as a field name in dBase IV while many attribute names in the 
aforementioned profile are longer. 

This paper explores potential designs to integrate OGC GeoPackage with OGC CDB to 
address the limitations of Esri Shapefiles within CDB. 

1.1 Joint Staff J7 
The mission of the Joint Staff J7 is to support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
and the Joint Warfighter though joint force development in order to advance the 
operational effectiveness of the current and future joint force.  The Joint Training 
Division has as its mission statement:  

“Develops and delivers a continuum of individual, staff, and collective joint training utilizing 
subject matter experts; adaptive processes; and integrated information technologies, in order to 
enhance the operational effectiveness of the current and future joint force.”   

Joint training requires terrain data modifications to meet training objectives.  An onsite 
Terrain Services team enables trained, ready, and adaptable Joint Forces by providing 
realistic terrain to support M&S for training events; however, the current Joint Live 
Virtual Constructive (JLVC) and Service simulation requires the knowledge, skills, and 
processes to support around 15 proprietary formats and growing.  Labor is limited, 
workload is extremely high, and demand from Service customers exceeds resources.   

In 2012, the JS J7 began to create a roadmap for the future joint training capability.  The 
mandates for change included DoD polices and directives that included the Joint 
Integrated Environment (JIE) and cloud-based computing, as well as the migration to a 
persistent cybersecurity scheme under the risk management framework (RMF).  Since 
development for many of the simulations in the JLVC area began in the 80s and 90s, they 
do not lend themselves to updating to the new environment. 

Other influencers on change include diminishing resources to send teams of system 
administrators and simulation instructor controllers overseas to conduct major joint 
training events, and fewer resources to create custom proprietary runtime databases for 
each scenario and simulation involved in these events.  The J7 goals are increased 
efficiency, ability to adjust fidelity as needed, sustainability, service-oriented 
architecture, discovery/accessibility/usability, and the ability to run in a cloud-based 
architecture.   

The outcome of this roadmap is the Joint Training Tools (JTT), a set of web-based tools 
that will enable the planning and execution of an exercise in a single user interface, with 
all digital data stored and available for modification and reuse in the future.  A key 
component of JTT is the Terrain Generation Service (TGS) to drive to a centralized 
location for terrain and geospatial data to support the JTT.  The requirements for TGS 
included the following: 

1. Global terrain – not limited to predefined play boxes; 



3

2. Ability to easily update and manage the global terrain and quickly add content 
from many sources and users (crowd sourcing); 

3. Based on open standards and specifications, leveraging the billions of dollars 
already invested into the GEOINT and commercial geospatial industry; 

4. Ability to integrate quickly with other online geospatial data services and support 
discovery, sharing, and reuse of data; 

5. Continued support to existing legacy simulations in the JLVC using output 
compliers; 

6. Ability to function as a dynamic runtime terrain for the future M&S as a Service 
(MSaaS) capability of JTT; and 

7. Support for planning and command and control applications that are involved in 
the Joint Exercise Life Cycle (JELC) process by global terrain in TGS. 

TGS leverages CDB as its terrain format.  JS J7 is committed to a collaborative effort to 
leverage geospatial standards to improve interoperability and integration of modeling and 
simulation, thus saving time and money for the DoD.   

1.2 Army Geospatial Center 
The AGC mission is to provide timely, accurate, and relevant geospatial information, 
capabilities and domain expertise for Army Geospatial Enterprise implementation in 
support of unified land operations.   

Within the AGC, the Systems Acquisition Support Directorate (SASD), Enterprise 
Services Branch (ESB) focuses on major Army programs and their interoperability as a 
holistic system.  The AGC staff in this branch manages the geospatial cross-cutting 
capability (CCC) within the U.S. Army Common Operating Environment (COE).  This 
effort requires the understanding and mapping of various geospatial technologies and 
standards.  ESB staff engages industry, standards bodies, and Army programs to identify 
technical gaps and works to address these issues to create a more efficient Army fighting 
force. 

AGC identified an enterprise-wide gap for disconnected data storage and dissemination 
in a lightweight geospatial standard and focused on the creation and specifics of OGC 
GeoPackage to address this gap.  This technology was designed to ensure mobile / 
handheld devices could interoperate with systems within the larger Command Post and 
U.S. Army Enterprise.   

After its inception, the GeoPackage specification has undergone many adaptations (both 
within and without OGC) to address a similar need.  Current GeoPackage adaptations can 
natively store 3D information, routing information, various types of data ‘tiles,’ and other 
geographically related datasets.   

As AGC and the Army assessed and studied the OGC CDB standard, AGC was wary that 
Shapefiles, the native vector storage format listed in OGC CDB (as a best practice), was 
not in alignment with the OGC or the U.S. Army Geospatial Enterprise.  Furthermore, as 
Army systems do not utilize CDB, it was reasonable to address some of the OGC CDB 



4 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

implementations to ensure interoperability with CDB and the AGC.  As such, an 
implementation of OGC GeoPackage within CDB aligns CDB vector data storage with 
the U.S. Army architecture. 

2. CONFORMANCE 
This discussion paper promotes the adoption of GeoPackage as a replacement for 
Shapefiles within the OGC CDB standard.  GeoPackage would be added as an alternative 
best practice of Volume 4: OGC CDB Best Practice use of Shapefiles for Vector Data 
Storage. 

No conformance is required.

4. LESSONS LEARNED FROM CREATING DOD STANDARDS 
Multiple M&S terrain standards have promised to be a panacea for all; but few, if any, 
have delivered on the promises.  Challenges facing new geospatial terrain standards have 
included proprietary formats, rarely used data containers, obsolescence, disconnected 
data silos, and heavy reliance of Government funding and management.    

4.1 Synthetic Environment Data Representation and Interchange Specification 
(SEDRIS) 

SEDRIS was initiated in 1994 as a co-sponsored activity by the program manager for 
Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (PM-CATT) at the Simulation Training and 
Instrumentation Command (STRICOM, now PEO STRI) and the Synthetic Theater of 
War (STOW) program at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  
The DoD led the development of SEDRIS with representation from industry.  The 
objective was to provide solutions to the complex problem of environmental data 
representation and interchange for networked heterogeneous applications.  The SEDRIS 
architecture centered on the creation of DoD unique data representation models, 
environmental coding specifications, spatial reference models, file formats, and 
application programming interfaces (API).  From the inception of SEDRIS to its final 
software release in July 2011, the overwhelming majority of funding for SEDRIS 
originated from the DoD.  SEDRIS utilization for terrain distribution significantly 
decreased and ultimately ended when DoD resources diminished. 

The SEDRIS initiative has both positive and negative lessons learned to help steer future 
terrain initiatives.  A strength of the SEDRIS is well-developed documentation describing 
the various data models in use and a level of sufficiency in open source software to read 
and write the terrain.  An area affecting the potential success with the SEDRIS initiative 
was its reliance on DoD unique formats with no commercial adoption. 

4.2 Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Portable Source Initiative (NPSI) 
NPSI is a simple concept with a simple goal: minimize the redundancy in database 
production across platforms without inhibiting innovation.  The basic concept of NPSI is 
to capture value-added work performed on raw source data.  This concept has resulted in 
significant cost savings and increased efficiency of database production to many DoD 
programs by minimizing the purchase and processing of new source data required for 



6 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

future developments.  The NPSI archive stores refined source data in datasets and makes 
the datasets available for utilization by future programs.  However, unlike the refined 
source data, runtime databases are not stored in the archive.   

The NPSI initiative has both positive and negative lessons learned to help steer future 
terrain initiatives.  A strength of the NPSI is the utilization of widely used commercial 
data formats to simplify the reading and distribution of NPSI data.  An area for 
improvement with the NPSI initiative is its weak and unenforced conceptual data model 
that hinders and complicates data reuse. 

4.3 Master Database (MDB) 
The SE Core MDB is a folder- and file-based repository of geospatial data representing 
all of the geographical areas that the SE Core program has collected, prepared, and 
delivered to the U.S. Army.  The SE Core MDB is defined for use within the SE Core 
production process and is designed to support the production of the runtime formats 
required for each U.S. Army Integrated Training Environment (ITE) systems. 

The MDB elevation data is contained in GeoTIFF and exportable in DTED formats.  The 
feature data is stored in Esri SDE™ and exportable to Esri SHAPE and File Geodatabase 
formats, and now OGC GeoPackage.  The data model is unique to SE Core and uses the 
SEDRIS Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) data dictionary.  The MDB 
imagery is stored in GeoTIFF and exportable to TIFF and JPEG2000.  The MDB 3D 
models are stored in both OpenFlight® (Presagis) and FilmBox™ (AutoDesk) for virtual 
and gaming, respectively.  The 3D models the textures and material maps are stored in 
Photoshop Document (PSD) files and exported to Truevision Graphics Adapter (TGA) 
for processing to runtime formats.  All metadata is stored in XML. The SE Core MDB 
contains only full government purpose rights data and is distribution-controlled by PEO-
STRI. 

The SE Core MDB is not a sharing standard.  It is a content data store, defined in industry 
formats, used internally in the production of the U.S. Army ITE simulation system 
runtime formats.  Long term, the goal of SE Core is to align the U.S. Army M&S 
Geospatial Data standards with Operational Mission Command (MC) Geospatial Data 
standards.  SE Core is working with the AGC in the development of a GeoPackage 
extension to support M&S.  SE Core is leveraging the Army’s Ground-Warfighter 
Geospatial Data Model (GGDM) with the NSG Feature Data Dictionary (NFDD) feature 
codes and attribution, with the intent to replace the SE Core data model with the GGDM.  
Additionally, SE Core is migrating the internal formats to use OGC GeoPackage where 
practical.   

The MDB initiative has both positive and negative lessons learned to help steer future 
terrain initiatives.  A strength of the MDB initiative is the employment of commercial file 
standards as the means for terrain data storage and well-defined use case models.  
Improvements of the MDB initiative include using National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency (NGA) logical data model in lieu of M&S unique logical data models (e.g., 
EDCS) and employing a conceptual model that supports data sharing.

4.4 CDB 
CDB is an open standard defining physical, logical, and conceptual models for a single, 
“versionable,” virtual representation of the earth.  CDB structured data stores provide for 
a geospatial content and model definition repository that is plug-and-play interoperable 
between database authoring workstations.  Moreover, a CDB structured data store can be 
used as a common online (or runtime) repository from which various simulator client-
devices can simultaneously retrieve and modify, in real-time, relevant information to 
perform their respective runtime simulation tasks (OGC CDB Standard, 2018). 

CDB was developed by USSOCOM to meet the need for a rapid, large-scale production 
capability for worldwide simulation databases for the Regiment and other SOF 
simulations.  The key design goals of CDB were to assure correlation between simulation 
subsystems by eliminating alternate storage formats of the same dirt, meet the ability to 
rapidly generate databases for mission rehearsal timelines, reduce the size of databases 
stored in a facility by eliminating the need of replication for each individual simulation 
subsystem, and simplify configuration by eliminating multiple representations of the 
same dirt (Freeman, 2017). 

Beyond the key design goals of CDB, core ideas of CDB include: organizing Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS) data in a standardized and documented structured data 
repository to promote data reusability and interoperability amongst systems and vendors, 
prebuilt levels of detail (LOD) to enable the same correlated terrain data to be used by 
numerous simulation systems even though they may be operating at different altitudes 
and distances from the ground, and the ability to dynamically update the terrain during a 
simulation exercise and share the resultant terrain in near real time across all of the 
simulation clients participating within the exercise.  Figure 1 outlines the CDB structure. 

 
Figure 1: CDB Structure 

The CDB initiative has both positive and negative lessons learned to help steer future 
terrain initiatives. A strength of the CDB initiative is the employment of commercial file 
standards as the means for terrain data storage, well-defined use conceptual models and 
an ability to serve as both a source repository and runtime format. Improvements to the 
CDB initiative include reducing the complex and voluminous file and folder system on 
disk.

5. GEOPACKAGE 
GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, 
compact format for transferring geospatial information.  The GeoPackage standard 
describes a set of conventions for storing the following within a SQLite database: vector 
features, tile matrix sets of imagery and raster maps at various scales attributes (non-
spatial data), and extensions. GeoPackage is capable of storing feature geometries as 
Points, LineStrings, Polygons, MultiPoints, MultiLineStrings, MultiPolygons, and 
GeomCollection.  For each feature, attributes can be stored as text, real numbers, 
Booleans, or raster/photos. A unique aspect to GeoPackage is the definitions that enable 
it to store binary blobs associated to features.  The binary blobs associated to features are 
defined by the encoding standards as hand-held photos; however, these binary blobs 
could be used to store geospecific models associated to features.  GeoPackage also stores 
multiple raster and tile pyramid data sets. “Tile pyramid” refers to the concept of pyramid 
structure of tiles of different spatial extent and resolution at different zoom levels, and the 
tile data itself. “Tile matrix” refers to rows and columns of tiles that all have the same 
spatial extent and resolution at a particular zoom level. “Tile matrix set” refers to the 
definition of a tile pyramid’s tiling structure (OGC GeoPackage Standard, 2018).   

The GeoPackage initiative has both positive and negative lessons learned to help steer 
future terrain initiatives. A strength of the GeoPackage is the portability and utility in 
non-traditional simulation environments, such as hand-held tactical devices.  
Improvements to the GeoPackage initiative include defining a full breadth of components 
that are necessary to perform live, virtual, and constructive simulations. 

6. THE FUTURE M&S AND GEOINT INDUSTRIES 
In his presentation at the GEOINT conference in 2017, Robert Cardillo, director of the 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, stated that “… in five years, there may be a 
million times more than the amount of geospatial data that we have today.”  Geospatial 
data—and its uses—are exploding at a rate that outpaces the levels of innovation and 
utilization in the traditional M&S industry.  Geospatial data is exploding at advanced 
rates of innovation for many reasons that include the advent of powerful and easily 
deployed sensors and drones, GPS tracking devices, crowd sourcing, and other disruptive 
technologies.  As the quantity of data collected increases, the desire and technologies to 
synthesize, disseminate, and analyze the data will also increase.   

The traditional M&S and GEOINT industries are on a path of unification.  The GEOINT 
industry is rapidly advancing its abilities to store, collect, synthesize, disseminate, 
analyze, and render geospatial data.  A key component to this advancement is the 
utilization and management of geospatial standards offered by the OGC.  The M&S 
industry has lagged with geospatial standardization in comparison to the GEOINT 
industry for many reasons; the most notable reason being the inability of the industry to 
sustain a global, innovative, collaborative, hands-on engineering, and rapid prototyping 
program for validating and testing geospatial technologies in an open forum that is not 
exclusively DoD managed.   

The M&S and GEOINT industries are also converging with respect to geospatial data.  
The OGC is a key forum influencing and facilitating this unification process.  Within the

OGC, there are two geospatial standards that best enable the unification of the M&S and 
GEOINT industries: OGC CDB and GeoPackage.  Usage of these standards is increasing 
in M&S and GEOINT industries, but they both contain weaknesses and strengths when it 
comes to the combined needs of both industries. 

 “GeoCDB”—a technology mashing of OGC GeoPackage and CDB—offers a 
deterministic repository of easily read geospatial datasets suitable for storage, runtime 
access, and dissemination for live, virtual, constructive, gaming, and mission command 
systems. 

7. DESIGNS 
Multiple approaches exist for leveraging GeoPackages within a CDB data store to offer 
an improved and multifaceted geospatial format capable of serving as a data repository 
and runtime format.  For the scope of this paper, the approaches are limited to the vector 
data domain; a future paper should include approaches to leverage GeoPackage to store 
raster and 3D objects in a CDB data store.   

The following sections consider four (4) designs for the incorporation of GeoPackage 
into a CDB data store where each design has a rationale, benefit with respect to 
improving CDB and leveraging GeoPackage capabilities, and disadvantage in terms of 
maintaining performance and/or fundamental design aspects of the CDB standard.   

7.1 Approach #1 (Replace each Shapefile with a GeoPackage) 
The easiest way to integrate a GeoPackage container into a CDB data store is to replace 
each Shapefile in a CDB data store with a GeoPackage.  Within a CDB geocell, vector 
data are tiled by data layers (e.g., roads, rivers, geotypicals, etc.) and by LODs.  CDB 
defines a level of detail required for vector features when feature count exceeds 4096.  
CDB defines 34 LODs based on a geotile definition where the dimensions of a geotile are 
1x1 degree between 50 degrees north and south of latitude (at higher latitudes geotiles 
expand in longitude to account of longitudinal compression).  In a fully populated CDB 
data store utilizing the Shapefile, best practice will have a vector file count of 33 at LOD 
0, 45 at LOD 1, 93 at LOD 2, 16,413 at LOD 6 and an astounding 2.8x1014 at LOD 23.  
Given the quantity of files, transferring a highly populated CDB is untimely. 

There a several advantages to this approach.  Replacing each Shapefile with a 
GeoPackage reduces the number of files representing a CDB tile by at least 3 to 1.  A 
Shapefile is composed of the following files: .SHP (vector geometry), .DBF (vector 
attribution), and .SHX (bounding information).  A CDB tile may contain additional files 
representing instance level attribution (.DBF) and projection information (.PRJ).  A 
GeoPackage is a single file that contains all the vector geometry, attribution, and 
bounding information.  Employing a GeoPackage in lieu of a Shapefile for every CDB 
vector tile would reduce file counts to 11 at LOD 0, 15 at LOD 1, 31 at LOD 2, 5471 at 
LOD 6, and 9.8x1013 at LOD 23.  Reducing the number of files in a CDB vector tile by 
3:1 also improves the transfer rates of CDB.  This approach has no relevant disadvantage 
other than it minimally exploits the capabilities available within GeoPackage. 

Experimentations with approach #1 are positive.  On average, the read time for a 
Shapefile is approximately 46 features per millisecond compared to 59 features per 



10 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

millisecond using GeoPackage.  This represents an approximately 23% improvement in 
the quantity of features read per unit time.  Transferring a single geotile of medium 
density vector data (e.g., LOD 4 with some LOD 5) in a Shapefile-based CDB from one 
folder to another executes in about 11,781 millisecond (total file count of 1378 files), on 
average.  Transferring the same CDB dataset encoded in GeoPackage takes about 3734 
milliseconds, a 68.3% improvement.   

7.2 Approach #2 (Make each CDB tile a layer in a single GeoPackage) 
Constructing each vector tile within CDB as a table within a GeoPackage for a given 
CDB dataset is a straightforward approach to utilize GeoPackage capabilities and 
significantly reduce file counts in a CDB (note that in GeoPackage a table is known as a 
layer).  SQLite is the underlying framework for GeoPackage.  The limitation on the 
number of tables in SQLite is 2,147,483,646 (a little over two billion).  SQLite supports 
the CDB LOD conceptual model up to LOD 14.  The concept of this approach is to 
exploit the high number of tables supported in SQLite to consolidate CDB tiles. 

There are advantages and disadvantages of this approach.  Making each Shapefile within 
a CDB into a table with GeoPackage reduces the number of files representing a CDB 
significantly.  However, as the time to open a GeoPackage exponentially increases as the 
number of tables increase; a fatal disadvantage. 

Experimentation with approach #2 is extremely negative.  The open time for a fully 
populated GeoCDB for LOD 0 is 7 milliseconds, LOD 3 is 24 milliseconds, and LOD 6 
is 5882 milliseconds, and LOD 7 is 53,114 milliseconds.  Shapefiles consistently open in 
only a few milliseconds.  The GeoCDB approach significantly degrades the performance 
of reading content from CDB in a rapid fashion and is a non-starter approach as a tenant 
of CDB is runtime utilization.  The methodology to open the GeoPackages includes 
GDAL and SQLiteBrowser.  Various versions of GDAL have different performance 
opening a GeoPackage suggesting a GDAL limitation; however, when using 
SQLiteBrowser to open the GeoPackages the same decay of open times is observed, 
albeit at a different magnitude.  An analysis of SQLiteBrowser code suggests the increase 
in open time is due to each table being analyzed to deduce the schema. 

7.3 Approach #3 (Store each CDB LOD as a layer in GeoPackage) 
Design approach #3 incorporates the lessons learn from experimentation with approach 
#2 to limit the number of tables within a GeoPackage and reduce the number of files in a 
CDB.  In this approach, the tables in the GeoPackage correspond to each LOD of CDB.  
The GeoPackage would contain 24 tables for each of the CDB LODs.  Each CDB geotile 
would contain a GeoPackage to correspond to the CDB data stores (such road networks, 
geospecific points, etc.).  CDB tiles for a data store combine into a single GeoPackage 
table within that given LOD where the tile definition (row and column) would be 
queryable attributes for each feature.  In simple language, to find the features in a tile for 
a particular geotile’s road network in LOD 3 of CDB, a consumer would open the road 
network GeoPackage, open the table that corresponds to LOD, and query for results 
where the column and row reference matches the CDB tile. 

Combining CDB tiles by LODs is a significant reduction in the number of files 
representing a CDB.  Employing approach #3 reduces file counts to only one (1) 



11 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

GeoPackage for a CDB geotile per CDB dataset.  A limitation of this approach is current 
CDB consumers will need to alter their method to finding tiles within a GeoPackage. 

Experimentations with approach #3 are positive.  Transferring a single geotile of medium 
density vector data (e.g., LOD 4 with some LOD 5) in a Shapefile-based CDB from one 
folder to another executes in about 11,781 millisecond (total file count of 1378 files), on 
average.  Transferring the same CDB dataset encoded in GeoPackage with this approach 
executes in about 421 milliseconds, a 96.4% improvement (27.9 times faster). 

7.4 Approach #4 (Store each CDB Data Store as a layer in GeoPackage) 
Design approach #4 extends design approach #3 to have a single GeoPackage per geotile 
of CDB.  In this approach, the tables in the GeoPackage correspond to each data store of 
CDB (such road networks, geospecific points, etc.).  The GeoPackage would contain 
eight (8) layers representing each of the CDB data stores (GSFeature, GTFeature, 
GeoPolitical, VectorMaterial, RoadNetwork, RailRoadNetwork, PowerLineNetwork, and 
HydrographyNetwork).  CDB tiles and LODs for a data store combine into a single 
GeoPackage table where the tile definition (row and column) and LOD would be 
queryable attributes for each feature.  In simple language, to find the features in a 
location for a particular geotile’s road network in LOD 3 of CDB, a consumer would 
open the geotile’s GeoPackage, open the table that corresponds to data store, and query 
for results where the LOD column and row reference matches the CDB tile and LOD. 

Combining CDB tiles and LODs by data stores is the maximum reduction in the number 
of files representing a CDB.  Employing approach #4 reduces file counts to a single 
GeoPackage for a CDB geotile.  With this approach, current CDB consumers would need 
to alter their method to finding CDB LODs and tiles within a GeoPackage. 

Experimentations with approach #4 are positive and similar to approach # 3. 

8. PATH AHEAD 
CDB and GeoPackage are both OGC standards.  The CDB standard is composed of 13 
volumes where volume 4 describes the best practice utilization of Shapefiles within CDB.  
The CDB Standards Working Group (SWG) will construct a new volume defining a best 
practice for the employment of GeoPackage within CDB.  The end state design of this 
best practice is a collaborate effort of the CDB SWG members that include AGC, 
SOCOM, Softwerx, CAE, Leidos, Cognitics, and NGA. 

The CDB conceptual model outlining the storage of imagery is applicable to GeoPackage 
as its tile matrix.  The raster tiles of GeoPackage are stored as either JPEG or PNG, 
which presents limitations of storing elevation data and raster materials from CDB.  A 
worthy extension of GeoPackage would include the incorporation of storing raster data in 
uncompressed structures including the ability to store floating-point values.  Another 
worthy extension to GeoPackage is the addition of 3D models to its structure. 

9. SUMMARY 
The Joint Staff J7 and AGC share a common objective to adopt standardized terrain 
formats.  The (JTSE stood up a Terrain Data Standards for Joint Training working group

to address the need for a “cooperative establishment of a joint training standard or 
specification for the encoding, storage, access, and modification of a representation of the 
natural and man-made terrain for virtual and constructive simulation applications” 
(Chambers and Callaway, 2017).  The mid-term recommendations include a common 
library framework and standardized attributes, while the long-term recommendations 
include defining a common storage format for terrain data by 2021 and beginning the 
migration of constructive simulations and tactical simulators to the common standard as a 
runtime format.  Additionally, the long-term recommendations include the ability to 
modify the common standard to meet unfulfilled requirements.   

The traditional M&S and GEOINT industries are on a path of unification.  The GEOINT 
industry is rapidly advancing its abilities to store, collect, synthesize, disseminate, 
analyze, and render geospatial data.  A key component to this advancement is the 
utilization and management of geospatial standards offered by the Open Geospatial 
Consortium.  The M&S industry has lagged with geospatial standardization in 
comparison to the GEOINT industry for many reasons; the most notable reason being the 
inability of the industry to sustain a global, innovative, collaborative, hands-on 
engineering and rapid prototyping program for validating and testing geospatial 
technologies in an open forum that is not exclusively DoD managed.   

Figure 2 presents a deterministic repository of easily read data geospatial datasets suitable 
for storage, runtime access, and dissemination for live, virtual, constructive, gaming, and 
mission command systems managed by an international standards body where the 
technologies can evolve and grow to meet currently unfulfilled and future requirements.  
GeoCDB offers substantial improvements in the file transfer times and access of M&S 
content.

Annex B: GeoCDB Experiment Statistics and Information 
The test CDB data consisted of: 

• 24 Geocells 
• LODs populated up to LOD 12 
• 237,296 Shapefile related files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .dbt) 
• 276GB size on disk 
• 203GB compressed size 
• 447,679 total files  (Original with Shapefiles) 

This experiment only placed vector data in GeoPackage files.  There were four (4) 
options tested with each option storing the data that is normally in a Shapefile in a 
GeoPackage.  Python code was written to convert an existing CDB for each option.  This 
Python code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/Cognitics/GeoCDB. 

Each option was affected by the scalability of the SQLite engine and the GeoPackage 
implementation.  The time required to open a file increased exponentially with the 
number of layers as shown in Table 1 and Figure 3.  When testing with 50,000 layers, we 
abandoned the test after waiting 24 hours.

Figure 3: GeoPackage Open Performance by Layer Count 

Each empty Shapefile still takes disk space and four files.  An empty layer in 
GeoPackage has a negligible footprint. 

Disk allocation units may greatly penalize large numbers of small files as is seen with 
Shapefiles, depending on the file system. 

None of the tests took advantage of spatial indexing for queries.  Spatial filters may offer 
additional performance benefits and functionality capabilities. 

For each option, the total number of files and the reduced disk space are shown in Table 2 
and Table 3.
