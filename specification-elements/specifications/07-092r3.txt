i. Preface 

This version 1.2 includes Corrigendum 2 as specified in [OGC 06-152r1]. 

This Best Practices Paper specifies Universal Resource Names (URNs) in the “ogc” URN 
namespace to be used for identifying definitions. This document specifies the formats 
used by these URNs, plus a set of specific URNs for specific definitions. These 
definitions should be used wherever applicable by implementations of various OGC 
Implementation Standards, including GML, WMS, WFS, and WCS.  

In this version of the document several modifications are made to reflect the fact that the 
EPSG dataset is now available in a data registry (www.epsg-registry.org). Furthermore 
some modifications reflect a change in Topic 2 - Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. 

This document does not require or encourage OGC standards to use only URNs defined 
in the "ogc" URN namespace. In addition, it does not encourage use of URNs when 
URLs are appropriate. Furthermore, other OGC documents do and can specify more 
URNs in the "ogc" URN namespace. 

However, OGC standards should specify that all URI values used with that standard have 
well-specified formats and meanings, preferably electronically accessible meanings. If 
well-specified URI values are not available for an OGC standard need, specification of 
new URNs in the "ogc" URN namespace should be considered (in that standard or 
elsewhere). If new URNs are being specified in another URN namespace for use with 
OGC standards, it would be useful if the same URN structure is used as is used by the 
OGC. 

Suggested additions, improvements, and comments on this Best Practice are welcome 
and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted to the editor by email message. 
Extensive and/or multiple changes can be suggested by making changes in an edited copy 
of this document. If you choose to submit suggested changes by editing this document, 
please make your suggested changes with change tracking on.

Introduction 

This document specifies Universal Resource Names (URNs) in the “ogc” URN 
namespace to be used for identifying definitions. These definitions include definitions of 
Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and related objects, as specified in OGC Abstract 
Specification Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinates, plus several other resource 
types for which standard identifiers are useful in OGC Web Services. This document 
specifies the formats used by these URNs, including formats that can reference 
definitions recorded in the EPSG database and by other authorities. This document also 
specifies URNs for some specific definitions for which OGC is the custodian.

Definition identifier URNs in OGC namespace 

1 Scope 

This document specifies Universal Resource Names (URNs) in the “ogc” URN 
namespace to be used for identifying definitions. These definitions include definitions of 
Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and related objects, as specified in OGC Abstract 
Specification Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinates. This document specifies the 
formats used by these URNs, including formats that can reference any definition recorded 
in the EPSG database. This document also specifies URNs for some specific definitions. 

This document specifies URN formats for several uses, currently including referencing 
definitions of: 

a) Single objects 
b) Not-completely-specified objects 
c) Combined objects 

Most XML attributes and elements with the anyURI data type that reference definitions, 
in all approved and draft OGC Implementation Standards, can use a URN value in the 
“ogc” URN namespace. Such a URN shall be used when a URL cannot be used to 
electronically access that definition, by all clients and servers that may need to reference 
that definition. 

The “ogc” definition URNs specified here should be used wherever applicable by 
implementations of all approved and draft OGC Implementation Standards, including 
GML, WMS, WFS, and WCS. Additional definition URNs in the “ogc” URN namespace 
are and will be specified in other OGC documents. 

2 Conformance 

Conformance with this Best Practice shall be checked using all the relevant tests 
specified in each separate specification that normatively references this Best Practice, and 
specifically references the applicable parts of this Best Practice. 

3 Normative references

6 Background 

6.1 Definition identifiers 

The OGC URN scheme is defined in OGC Document 06-166. It specifies a family of 
identifiers for resources of interest in OGC Web Services, mostly resources provided or 
defined by the OGC.  

The “def” branch of the OGC URN scheme is defined in this document. This branch 
provides standard identifiers for many concepts and definitions. These definitions include 
coordinate reference systems and related components, units of measure, nils, and various 
object types and definitions. These include definitions and concepts maintained by OGC 
and by other authorities who do not provide URNs for their concepts, but which are of 
importance in OGC Web Services and encodings.  

The URN syntax is useful because (a) it provides persistent identifiers that are 
independent of resource location, while (b) being part of the URI scheme, and thus 
compatible with referencing in a web context. A uniform identification scheme is useful 
for interoperability, allowing use of short identifiers for concepts. These identifiers allow 
suitable software to make rapid comparisons, and to obtain values from a local cache 
when available, in preference to accessing definitions from a remote service.  

6.2 Use for Coordinate Reference Systems  

One frequent use is referencing the CRS for an OWS server input or output; another use 
is referencing the CRS for a feature geometry or a bounding box. These URNs are used 
to identify the referenced CRS, not to transfer a definition of that CRS. Most of this 

6 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-092r3 

material is also applicable to referencing CRS components and Coordinate Operations 
and their components, often referred to as objects. 

NOTE 1 Subclause D.14 of [OGC 06-121r3] summarizes many of the requirements considered when 
specifying how to reference CRSs.  

Document [OGC 06-121r3] specifies that each specific OWS shall always reference a 
CRS by using a XML attribute or element with the type anyURI. Such an anyURI value 
can be used to reference a CRS whether the definition of that CRS is included in the same 
data transfer, is NOT included in the same data transfer, cannot be electronically 
accessed, or can be electronically accessed. 

NOTE 2 In XML Schemas, the anyURI data type is the standard way to briefly reference (or cite) 
something specified elsewhere. XML attributes with the type anyURI include the GML defined attributes 
named gml:srsName, gml:uom, xlink:href, and gml:codeSpace. 

When using a XML attribute or element with the type anyURI to reference a CRS, CRS-
related, or other object, that URI shall have a value which uses one of two alternative 
URI formats: 

a) Universal Resource Locator (URL), with standard form. The URL format should be 
used whenever the referenced definition is known to be electronically available using 
this standard URL. 

b) Universal Resource Name (URN), with a specified form. The URN format shall be 
used whenever the referenced definition is not, or might not be, available using a 
URL. This URN shall reference data that is specified by some “authority” and is 
“well-known” to both client and server software, including multiple clients and 
multiple servers. 

NOTE 3 Two widely-used forms of URI are URL and URN. We are specifying using URNs as the way 
of citing CRS-related definitions that are "well-known" but are not adequately electronically available 
using a URL.  

Subclause 10.3.2 of the OWS Common standard[OGC 06-121r3] specifies when and how 
to use URLs to reference a CRS or CRS-related object. Use of URNs is expected to be 
more common than use of URLs, and specific OWS Implementation Standards are 
expected to specify many standard URN values.  

6.3 Relationships to other identification schemes 

6.3.1 URN and URL 

URNs [IETF RFC 2141] are a kind of URI [IETF RFC 2396], and may be used as the 
value of references where a URI is required. This is often the case in GML-based 
encodings (e.g., the standard XML attributes xlink:href, xlink:role, xlink:arcrole, 
srsName, uom, codeSpace) and in OGC Web Services (OWS) operation requests and 
responses.  

Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  7
 



OGC 07-092r3 

A URN serves as a persistent identifier of a resource or concept. A detailed description of 
the resource may also be available online, with a resource locator (URL) providing an 
access point. In general, there is no direct mapping or algorithm to obtain a URL for the 
resource designated by a URN. URNs are intended to be more persistent than URLs, so 
that they remain valid even if a resource description is relocated. However, a resolution 
service or resolver may provide a URL corresponding to a URN.  

NOTE  In the future it is expected that the OGC Network will provide a resolution service for URNs in 
the OGC scheme.  

6.3.2 URN and schema component designators 

In a few places in OWS interfaces, an identifier for an XML component is required. In 
these cases, it is important that the identifier reference the actual schema definition, 
which may then be used as the template for an OWS request or response.  

A number of options are available for identification of schema components. The W3C 
XML Schema recommendation provides QName (qualified name – see XML Schema 
Part 2, clause 3.2.18). A QName has the lexical form ns:name where “ns” is an XML 
namespace prefix for which a namespace declaration is in scope. The QName thus 
corresponds with an identifier tuple {namespace, local name} where “namespace” is the 
fully scoped identifier for the XML namespace. In contrast, a URN identifier is complete, 
and does not depend on context for resolution of the namespace prefix.  

NOTE  The W3C XML activity is currently considering a more complete scheme for identification of 
schema components, documented in the working draft XML Schema: Component Designators [9].  

In OWS interfaces, XML components are generally identified using a QName.  

While there is some overlap of the meaning of schema component designators with the 
OGC URN scheme used for dataTypes (clause 8.5) and featureTypes, it should be 
understood that a URN identifies the concept, and not just its XML and XML Schema 
implementation. Of course, the concepts denoted by identifiers from the featureType 
branch generally have XML Schema implementations, so direct mappings are implied. 
Note that the mapping may be one-to-many, for example to manage versioning of the 
XML schema implementation independent of versioning of the concept.  

Table 10 in Subclause 8.5 provides definitions in the dataType branch, together with 
mappings to a QName designation of equivalent XML schema components. That 
subclause provides the complete definition of URNs in the dataType branch, since 
“OGC” is the only authority recognised for this branch.  

For the featureType branch, it is expected that many authorities will have an interest in 
using the “def” branch of the OGC URN scheme to provide feature type identifiers. It is 
incumbent on each authority to indicate the mapping from the URN form of identifier to 
other schema component designators, such as a QName, so that the use of these in OWS 
interfaces is unambiguous.

7.1 OGC URN scheme 

The OGC URN scheme is defined in OGC Document 06-166. It specifies a family of 
identifiers for resources of interest in the context of OGC Web Services, mostly 
concerning resources provided or defined by OGC. The OGC scheme has the form  

urn:ogc:{category.label}:{ResourceSpecificString} 

The category.label must be one of a set of values that are not yet specified, except that 
this document specifies the “def” value and the corresponding ResourceSpecificString 
format.  

7.2 URNs for single objects 

To identify the definition of a single object, the URN shall have the form: 

 urn:ogc:def:objectType:authority:version:code 
 
The “urn”, “ogc”, “def”, and six “:” parts of this URN are fixed. The “ogc” part shall be 
the registered namespace authority for all URNs used by the OGC. The “def” part shall 
be the fixed category label which identifies all the OGC URNs that reference object 
definitions. The “objectType” part shall be an OGC-specified unique-identifier of the 
type of the referenced definition. 

NOTE 1 The ”ogc” part denotes the namespace authority in a URN, and the value used should be 
registered with IANA. Pending the official registration of the OGC scheme with IETF/IANA, the value “x-
ogc” should be used, where the “x” denotes an experimental namespace. The “def” part is a value for the 
{category.label} part specified in [OGC 06-166]. The remaining “objectType:authority:version:code” parts 
are values of the {ResourceSpecificString} part specified in [OGC 06-166]. 

The “objectType” part shall be the OGC-specified token for the type of concept identified 
by the URN.  

NOTE 2 The set of object types denoted by the OGC URN scheme is currently specified normatively in 
Table 2 in this document and revisions. In the future it is expected that this mechanism will be replaced by 
a dynamic registry.  

The “authority” part shall be the OGC-specified abbreviation for the authority 
organization that specified the referenced definition.  

NOTE 3 The set of authorities recognised for the purposes of the OGC URN scheme is currently 
specified normatively in Table 1 in this document. In future it is expected that this mechanism will be 
replaced by a dynamic registry.  

The optional “version” part shall be the version of the authority or code for the referenced 
definition. The “code” part shall be a unique identifier of the referenced definition, as 
specified by the referenced authority. The “code” part can be human-understandable, 
provided that it is unique for that authority, version, and objectType. In this use, all 
textual parts of URN values shall be case-insensitive.

OGC 07-092r3 

The “version” part of these URNs can be omitted when the referenced definition does not 
have a version, and the referenced definition is not specific to an authority version. When 
included, the “version” shall be recorded in the format specified by the authority. The 
version format is sometimes “N.N.N” or “N.N”, where each “N” stands for an integer. If 
no other version identification is provided by the authority, a year or other date can be 
used. No "v" or other version prefix shall be included. 

The required “authority” part identifies an authority recognized by the OGC, and the 
allowed “authority” values shall include those listed in Table 1. In this table, the third 
column references a specification for each "authority" value. All URNs that include this 
"authority" value shall mean exactly what is meant by that specification, when the 
corresponding “code” and “version” values are used. 

EXAMPLE  The URN value urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326 shall mean the Coordinate Reference 
System (CRS) with code 4326 specified in version 6.6 of the EPSG database available at 
http://www.epsg.org/. That CRS specifies the axis order as Latitude followed by Longitude.

a The Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) is recognized as an authority that specifies a 
vocabulary of phenomena in its Attributes dictionary (“EAs”). 
b The EPSG database is now maintained by the OGP Surveying and Positioning Committee, and is 
recognized as an authority that specifies many CRS-related definitions. 
c The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) recognizes itself as one or more authorities, here using “OGC” as 
the one current authority abbreviation. 
d The International System of Units (SI) is recognized as an authority that specifies basic units of measure 
and a limited selection of derived units. 
e The Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) is recognized as an authority that specifies symbols for 
denoting a large set of basic units of measure and a grammar that defines combinations of these that correspond 
with symbols that are commonly used in commerce, scientific and engineering applications.  
f Values from the Label or Code columns of the attribute Tables 6.5 – 6.30 of ISO/IEC 18025:2005. 
g The OGC shall explicitly specify each “code” and “version” value defined by the “OGC” authority. Clause 
8 of this document specifies some of these codes and versions. Additional OGC codes and versions are now 
specified in Clause 10 of OGC 05-096r1, and more can be specified in future OGC Implementation 
Specifications and Best Practices Papers. 
h Plus combinations of symbols as defined in the SI specification. Note that some symbols include elements 
that are not available on a standard character entry device (e.g. , °C). For these units, it is recommended that 
the UCUM symbol and URN be used in preference. See also footnote i.  
i UCUM specifies code values or symbols using the reduced character set universally available on character 
entry devices (“7-bit ascii"), and combinations of these generated using the grammar described in the UCUM 
specification. For this reason the use of UCUM codes is preferred to those specified in ISO 31:1992 [8], as the 
latter specifies the use of superscripts and non-latin symbols for certain units. While these are in principle 
supported by Unicode, for practical reasons the reduced character-set encoding is preferred for use in the URN 
syntax. 

 
The required “objectType” part identifies the type of the referenced definition, and the 
allowed “objectType” values shall include those listed in Table 2.

should be the EPSG “code” unique identifier of the referenced definition. Alternately, the 
“code” part of a URN can be the EPSG “name” unique identifier.  It is recommended to 
omit the version number, as this is not required to identify a referenced record in the 
EPSG dataset and may even lead to confusion.

OGC 07-092r3 

NOTE 2 The policy of the OGP Survey and Positioning Committee is to not delete any entities.  
However, if a record is found to be incorrect, that record is deprecated and replaced. When this is done, the 
deprecation field of the deprecated record is changed from "false" to "true". (In some implementations, 
"false" may be "0" or "no", and "true" may be "1" or "yes"). Deprecated records are also termed ‘invalid 
records’ When retrieving any geodetic parameters from the EPSG dataset a user therefore needs to verify 
whether the record(s) is / are valid or invalid. The user then has two options: (1) to follow the links 
provided and use the valid replacing record(s), a course typically followed when spatially referencing a 
new dataset, or (2) retrieve the invalid, deprecated record(s) in order to undo the effects of this error in an 
existing spatial dataset that had been spatially referenced using the incorrect records. Note that spatial 
referencing using (an) invalid EPSG entities will only generate errors if the data is subsequently subjected 
to coordinate conversions and/or transformations.   

Example 1 The URN value for CRS 2984 is: 
 urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::2984. 
 
However, this entity has been deprecated and has been replaced by CRS 3163: 
 
 urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3163. 
 
Example 1 The URN value for the “WGS 84 longitude-latitude” CRS specified in Subclause B.3 of 
WMS 1.3 (previously referenced as “CRS:84”) is: 
 urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84 
 

7.3 URN extensions for OGC 

The following Subclauses 7.4 and 7.5 extend the normal uses of URNs to meet OGC 
needs, primarily for referencing Coordinate Reference Systems. One URN is required to 
uniquely and persistently identify one resource. Normally each URN value is opaque to 
URN users, and the sets of URNs and corresponding resources are both enumerable and 
peristent. The following URN extensions allow a non-enumerable (sometimes infinite) 
set of URNs to reference the corresponding non-enumerable set of (OGC) resources. The 
specific URNs and corresponding resources that are currently in use is expandable to 
other members of these non-enumerable sets. 

NOTE 1 A non-enumerable set of URNs with the corresponding non-enumerable set of resources can be 
considered to be “virtual”, not being implemented until needed. When needed, a specific URN in this set 
can be automatically instantiated with its corresponding resource. Given a specific URN in such a non-
enumerable (sometimes infinite) set of URNs, the corresponding specific resource in the corresponding 
non-enumerable set of resources can be automatically instantiated. Or given a specific resource in such a 
non-enumerable set of resources, the corresponding specific URN in the corresponding non-enumerable set 
of URNs can be automatically instantiated. Except for automatic implementation of the corresponding 
resource, these specific URNs can be used just like normal URNs, to uniquely, opaquely, and persistently 
identify the one corresponding resource. Only the appropriate URN resolution and registration service(s) 
need to know about the virtual nature of these sets of URNs with the corresponding set of resources. 

NOTE 2 An extended URN can also be considered to be “parameterized”, with parameter values in the 
URN value being used as specific values for the corresponding parameters in a corresponding 
parameterized resource. Again, only the appropriate URN resolution and registration service(s) need to 
know about the parameterized nature of these sets of URNs with the corresponding set of resources. Each 
specific URN is opaque to URN users, and the associated specific resource is persistent (but not necessarily 
stored, or stored at fixed locations). 

Each URN in such a non-enumerable set opaquely references the corresponding resource 
in such a non-enumerable set, where this correspondence is persistent (or fixed) although 
neither set is enumerable. That is, only the appropriate URN resolution and

OGC 07-092r3 

creation/registration service(s) need to know that a non-enumerable set of URNs is 
referencing the corresponding non-enumerable set of resources. A URN resolution 
service can take any specific URN in such a non-enumerable set of URNs and 
automatically instantiate the corresponding specific resource in the corresponding non-
enumerable set of resources. A URN registration service can take any specific resource 
which falls in such a non-enumerable set of resources and automatically instantiate the 
corresponding specific URN in the corresponding non-enumerable set of URNs. Each 
specific URN is opaque to URN users, and the associated specific resource is persistent 
(but not necessarily stored, or stored at fixed locations). 

7.4 URNs for not-completely-specified objects 

A URN can also be used to denote a not-completely-specified object, which is specified 
without the values of a few identified parameters. In this case, the URN value includes 
the values for each identified parameter. To identify an object with two unspecified 
parameters, the URN shall have the form: 

urn:ogc:def:objectType:authority:version:code:value1:value2 
 
NOTE 1 Not-completely-specified objects are very useful when many similar objects are needed, 
especially when the possible values of the distinguishing parameters cannot be enumerated. 

EXAMPLE 1 Subclause 6.7.3.4 and Annex B of WMS 1.3.0 specify five not-completely-specified map 
projections, where the parameters specify the central meridian, etc. 

EXAMPLE 2 Clause 7 of [OGC 05-096r1] specifies two not-completely-specified unrectified image 
CRSs, where the single parameter specifies the image identifier. 

In this URN form, the values for the previously-identified parameters are added to the 
URN form for a single object, as specified above. The obvious variations on the URI 
form can be used when one or three parameters are unspecified. The object identified by 
the “authority”, “version”, and “code” must be completely specified with the exception of 
the values for a few clearly identified parameters. Whenever such a parameter value 
requires a unit of measure (uom), the uom for that parameter shall be specified by the 
referenced not-completely-specified object. 

EXAMPLE 3 The URN value for the Auto Orthographic CRS 42003 specified in Subclauses 
6.7.3.4 and B.9 of WMS 1.3.0 is: 
 urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:AUTO42003:1:-100:45 
 
NOTE 2 Additional examples of not-completely-specified objects are specified in Subclauses B.7, B.8, 
B.10, and B.11 of WMS 1.3.0, and in Subclauses 10.1 through 10, 3 of [OGC 05-096r1].

7.5 URNs for combined objects 

7.5.1 Overview 

In some cases, it is useful to reference two or more well-known objects that are 
combined, where the combination is specified at run time. Such combining of two or 
more well-known objects shall only be used when all of the following conditions are true: 

a) The objects being combined are correct for the combination being formed, as these 
objects are specified in [OGC 08-015] for CRS-related objects. 

b) This combination of objects is not an existing well-known object, such as specified in 
the EPSG database or a geodetic parameter dataset of an acknowledged alternative 
authority. 

NOTE 1 If combining two or more well-known objects, please ask if this combination will be frequently 
used. If combining only EPSG codes because EPSG has not populated this combination, please send a 
request for this combination to the EPSG if this combination is likely to be frequently used. Similarly, if 
combining OGC codes, by themselves or with EPSG codes, please suggest that this combination be added 
to the OGC codes, if this combination is likely to be frequently used. 

c) The objects being combined are all in the “ogc” URN namespace, preferably all 
defined by the same authority (e.g., EPSG or OGC). 

NOTE 2 If objects specified by different authorities are combined, there is higher risk that these objects 
are not compatible. For example, some authorities might specify objects different from [OGC 08-015]. 

d) Using a URN for the combination is desirable, since it is not convenient to combine 
these objects in an XML document based on GML, and then reference this document 
using a URL (as specified in Subclauses 10.3.1 and 10.3.2 of [OGC 06-121r3]). 

A URN that identifies a definition that is itself defined by combining two or more objects 
shall be constructed by concatenating the URNs of the two individual objects into one 
URN, as follows: 

urn:ogc:def:objectType,objectType:authority:version:code,
objectType:authority:version:code 

 
Similarly, an identifier can concatenate the URNs of the three individual objects, using 
the URN form: 

urn:ogc:def:objectType,objectType:authority:version:code,
objectType:authority:version:code,objectType:authority:version
:code 

 
NOTE 3 When URNs are concatenated like this, the combined object is implicitly defined, and is not 
assigned a single object “code”. That is, the defined object has no single code. 

In a concatenated URN, the first “objectType” is the type of the combined object. 
Combined references in a URN can be used for defining several types of objects, as 
specified by specific Implementation Standards, including for: 

Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  15
 



OGC 07-092r3 

a) Compound coordinate reference systems 
b) Concatenated operations 
c) Projected and derived coordinate reference systems 
d) Combining a datum and a coordinate system into a coordinate reference system 
e) Objects defined by specific Implementation Standards 

The first four combinations listed above are described in the following subclauses. 

7.5.2 URN combined references for compound coordinate reference systems 

A URN reference to combined objects can be allowed for any compound coordinate 
reference system (CompoundCRS) that combines two or three well-known CRSs. In this 
case, the URN shall concatenate the URNs of the two or three individual well-known 
CRSs. This combining is allowed only when all the conditions specified in Subclause 
7.3.1 are met. 

The URNs of the individual well-known CRSs shall be listed in the same order in which 
the individual coordinate tuples are combined to form the CompoundCRS 
coordinate tuple. All the “objectType” values shall be “crs”. 

EXAMPLE  The URN value for combining the CRSs: EPSG 4269 (NAD83) and EPSG 5713 (Canadian 
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1928 height is: 

 urn:ogc:def:crs,crs:EPSG::4269,crs:EPSG::5713 
 
 
7.5.3 URN combined references for concatenated operations 

A URN reference to combined objects can be allowed for any concatenated coordinate 
operation (ConcatenatedOperation) that combines two or more well-known coordinate 
operations. In this case, the URN shall concatenate the URNs of the two or more well-
known coordinate operations. This combining is allowed only when all the conditions 
specified in Subclause 7.3.1 are met. 

NOTE 1 In particular, the coordinate operations concatenated must meet the stated constraint: The 
sequence of operations is constrained by the requirement that the source coordinate reference system of 
step (n+1) must be the same as the target coordinate reference system of step (n). The source coordinate 
reference system of the first step and the target coordinate reference system of the last step are the source 
and target coordinate reference system associated with the concatenated operation. 

NOTE 2 In a well-known dataset, a CoordinateOperation may be registered only in one direction, with 
the reverse operation being implied. This means that the roles of source and target CRS may have to be 
swapped if an implied-reverse CoordinateOperation is included in a ConcatenatedOperation. In this case, 
the swapped source and target CRS shall satisfy the above constraint. 

The URNs of the individual coordinate operations shall be concatenated in the order of 
coordinate operation application. The “objectType” values shall all be 
“coordinateOperation”.

OGC 07-092r3 

EXAMPLE  The URN value for combining the EPSG XXXX and EPSG YYYY coordinate operations 
is: 

urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation,coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX,coord
inateOperation:EPSG::YYYY 

 
7.5.4 URN combined references for projected or derived CRSs 

A URN reference to combined objects can be allowed for any projected coordinate 
reference system (ProjectedCRS) that combines a well-known GeographicCRS and a 
well-known (defined by) Conversion. In this case, the URN shall concatenate the URNs 
of the one well-known CRS, one well-known Conversion, and one well-known 
CartesianCS. This combining is allowed only when all the conditions specified in 
Subclause 7.3.1 are met. 

Similarly, a URN reference to combined objects can be allowed for any derived 
coordinate reference system (DerivedCRS) that combines a well-known base CRS, a 
well-known CoordinateSystem, and a well-known (defined by) Conversion. 

The URNs of the individual components of the projected or derived CRS shall be listed 
in the order of GeographicCRS, CS, and then Conversion. The four “objectType” values 
shall be “crs”, “crs”, “cs”, and “coordinateOperation”. 

EXAMPLE  The URN value for combining the EPSG XXXX CRS, EPSG YYYY CS, and EPSG 
ZZZZ Conversion to define a custom projected or derived CRS is: 

urn:ogc:def:crs,crs:EPSG::XXXX,cs:EPSG::YYYY,coordinateOperation:EPS
G::ZZZZ 

 
7.5.5 URN combined references for datum and coordinate system 

A URN reference to combined objects can be allowed for a coordinate reference system 
that combines a well-known datum with a well-known coordinate system. In this case, 
the URN shall concatenate the URNs of one well-known datum and one well-known 
coordinate system. This combining is allowed only when all the conditions specified in 
Subclause 7.3.1 are met. 

The URNs of the individual components shall be listed in the order of datum and then 
coordinate system. The three “objectType” values shall be “crs”, “datum” and “cs”. 

EXAMPLE  The URN value for combining the EPSG XXXX datum and EPSG YYYY coordinate 
system to define a custom CRS is: 

 urn:ogc:def:crs,datum:EPSG::XXXX,cs:EPSG::YYYY 
 

8 URN values for definitions and concepts in ogc namespace 

8.1 Introduction 

This clause provides the normative specification and URNs for some specific object 
definitions defined by the OGC. Additional definitions in the “ogc” URN namespace will

OGC 07-092r3 

be specified in other OGC documents. For example, more URNs are specified in 
Subclause 7.1 of the GML grid CRSs profile [OGC 05-096r1]. 

NOTE  Many examples of “ogc” URN use for object definitions are contained in the GML examples in 
Annex A of this document, in Clause 7 of [OGC 05-096r1], and in Clause 6 of [OGC 05-095r1]. 

8.2 CRS definitions 

The definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) defined by the OGC shall use 
the URNs listed in Table 3. The URN parts shown as “99” ands “8888” represent 
numbers that shall be substituted for the specified parameter values. All of these CRSs 
are defined in Annex B of WMS 1.3 [OGC 06-042].

The definitions of the standard values for the five CodeList stereotyped classes specified 
in Tables 9, 31, 32, 37, and 39 of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2 [OGC 08-015] 
shall use the URNs listed in Tables 2 through 6. The definitions of these values shall be 
as specified in the XML documents in Subclauses A.2 through A.6.

8.4 Unit-of-measure (uom) definitions 

The definitions of some units-of-measure which are defined by the OGC shall use the 
URNs listed in Table 9. The definitions of these units shall be as specified in the XML 
document in Subclause A.7. Most of these units are also specified by the EPSG, as listed.

8.5 Data type definitions 

URNs are useful to identify data types in multiple OGC Implementation Standards. These 
uses include in the ows:DataType (metadata) element in the ows:DomainType in the new 
version of the OWS Common Implementation Standard [OGC 06-121r3]. The OGC-
specified URNs that can be used for identifying data types (expected to be used in 
multiple OGC Implementation Standards) shall include those listed in Table 10. The left 
column lists each URN specified here, and the centre column lists the definition which 
shall be used for that URN. 

Use of these URNs is not limited to data encoded in XML, or even to use of these URNs 
in XML-encoded documents. When data is encoded in XML, the right column in this 
table lists an XML Schema (XSD) or Geometry Markup Language (GML) version 3.1.1 
identifier that can be used to encode that data type. More complete definitions of some of 
these data types are specified in the XML document in Subclause A.8.

Annex A 
(normative) 

 
GML dictionaries of OGC definitions 

A.1 Introduction 

This annex provides XML documents that specify the definitions of some of the objects 
assigned “ogc” URN values in Clause 8. Except for units-of-measure, these definitions 
are encoded in XML using the GML 3.1.1 simple dictionary profile [OGC 05-099r2]. 
The unitsDictionary is encoded in XML using coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd from 
GML 3.1.1. 

NOTE  All of these definitions also could be encoded using the gml:Dictionary element from 
dictionary.xsd in GML 3.1.1. The XML documents could be identical except for referencing dictionary.xsd 
in GML 3.1.1 instead of referencing the GML 3.1.1 simple dictionary profile. 

These XML-encoded document files may be bundled in a zip file with this document. 
These XML files are also posted online at the URL 
http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/definitions/, in a lower level directory used for this 
Version of this document. In the event of a discrepancy between the bundled and online 
versions of these XML files, the online files shall be considered authoritative. 

A server may reference an exact copy of these documents located elsewhere, as long as 
they are readily accessible by clients. For example, it may be desirable to place the 
referenced documents on the same network server as an OWS instance, since that 
decreases the number of points of possible network failure. Such local copies should be 
organized into directories similar to http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/. The server owner 
shall insure that any such local copies are kept up-to-date with respect to the authoritative 
files at http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/. 

A.2 Definitions of derivedCRSType values 

The definitions of the derivedCRSType standard values used in defining DerivedCRSs 
shall be the same as can be XML encoded in the GML 3.1.1 simple dictionary profile:
