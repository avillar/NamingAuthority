Introduction 

The OGC Web Map Service (WMS) implementation specification version 1.1.0 defines 
keyword/value encodings for operation requests using HTTP GET.  This document 
describes XML encodings for requests using HTTP POST.  This document is advanced 
as a draft candidate for a new Part 2 of the WMS specification. 

Basic GET encodings are directly usable by standard World Wide Web user agents, and 
may be bookmarked, sent in email, pasted into HTML documents, and so forth.  The ease 
of use of the GET encoding is its primary benefit.  However, it does have some 
disadvantages.  Additional semantics must be defined to, for example, associate a list of 
layers with a list of styles.  Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) WMS requests, which include 
an XML description of the styling, are difficult to encode directly and require that the 
request URL make reference to a separate SLD URL.  Proposals to add a Filter parameter 
have been made more complex by the need to associate specific Filter expressions with 
specific Layers.  Length limitations on HTTP URLs may preclude all of the desired 
parameters from being included in the request. 

The optional HTTP POST encodings defined in this document are meant to provide 
additional structure in the request message and thereby to allow additional functionality 
without encountering size restrictions and encoding ambiguities.  The greatest benefit is 
felt in the GetMap operation, where the comma-separated list of Layer names in HTTP 
GET can be replaced by a sequence of XML elements, each of which is either a named or 
a user-defined Layer, and directly associating Style and Filter information within each 
Layer.  The GetFeatureInfo operation, which includes most of a GetMap request, benefits 
in a similar way. 





OGC 02-017r1 

  
 

Web Map Service Implementation Specification  Part 2: 
XML for Requests using HTTP POST 

1 Scope 

This part of the Web Map Service (WMS) specification applies to those clients and 
servers which allow operation request encodings that are more complex than those 
permitted by the basic keyword/value encoding defined in WMS Part 1 [17].  Part 2 only 
describes the encoding of the request messages using Extensible Markup Language 
(XML); all other aspects of the Web Map Service are fully defined in Part 1. 

2 Conformance 

An implementation conformant with this Part of the WMS specification must also be 
conformant with Part 1 [17].  Additional conformance tests for this Part only are listed in 
Annex D. 

The following Sections of Part 1 shall not apply to conformance based on Part 2: 

- 6.2.1: "Reserved characters in HTTP GET URLs" 

- 6.2.2: "HTTP GET" 

3 Normative references 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this 
text, constitute provisions of this specification. For dated references, subsequent 
amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. However, parties 
to agreements based on this specification are encouraged to investigate the possibility of 
applying the most recent editions of the normative documents indicated below. For 
undated references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies.

In the sections labeled as normative, the key words "must", "must not", "required", 
"shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" 
in this document are to be interpreted as described in Internet RFC 2119 [15].

6 WMS Operation with HTTP POST 

[Debate about whether to use SOAP[19] has not been completely settled by tests on 
actual implementations, so two alternatives are temporarily described here.] 

WMS requests using HTTP POST are made as follows: 

(1) The OnlineResource URL of the request message is determined from the Capabilities 
XML of the service instance according to this XPath [21] expression: 

/WMT_MS_Capabilities/Capability/Request/(operation)/DCPType/
HTTP/Post/OnlineResource/@xlink:href

where (operation) refers to GetCapabilities, GetMap, or another operation 
name.  A line break has been added for clarity. 



OGC 02-017r1

If this XPath expression is not resolvable for the desired operation, then the service 
instance does not support HTTP POST and the Client must not attempt communication 
using that protocol.  This specification does not apply to such service instances. 

(2) An XML document conformant with the XML Schema in Annex A for the desired 
operation is constructed. 

(2a) (with SOAP) The message document from step 2 is enclosed in a SOAP envelope as 
follows: 

<env:Envelope
xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2001/09/soap-envelope">
<env:Body>
request document here

</env:Body>
</env:Envelope>
 

[The request document in (2) uses SOAP value encoding (which is based on XML 
Schema) and therefore could legally be used alone or in a SOAP envelope.] 

(3) The request message is sent to the OnlineResource in (1) according to the HTTP 
POST rules defined in [8].  The following HTTP request headers must be used (along 
with any others mandated by [8]). 

(3a) (without SOAP)  

Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
-or?-
Content-Type: application/vnd.ogc.request+xml
The text/xml content type is mandated by SOAP [19] and is generically applicable to the 
document constructed in step (2).  However, it might be useful to define operation-
specific MIME [11] types as in the second alternative (where request is one of the 
defined operation names). 

Content-Length: nnnn
The content length is the number of bytes in the document created in (2).  

(3b) (with SOAP)  

Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8" 
The text/xml content type is mandated by SOAP. 

Content-Length: nnnn
The content length is the number of bytes in the document created in (2), including the 
SOAP envelope. 

SOAPAction:



OGC 02-017r1 

©OGC 2002 – All rights reserved 5
 

A SOAPAction header is required by SOAP, and may have a null value.  [It is not clear 
when it should be non-null; its value is a URL, and need not be that of the 
OnlineResource to which the request is sent.] 

(4) A response in received from the server. 

(4a) (without SOAP): the response is one of the operation responses defined in WMS Part 
1 [17].  That is, for GetCapabilities the results is Capabilities XML with MIME type 
application/vnd.ogc.wms+xml; for GetMap the result is a map image with the correct 
MIME [11] type; if an error has occurred the response is a Service Exception; etc. 

(4b) (with SOAP): the response is a multipart-MIME document formatted according to 
the SOAP Messages with Attachments [20] note from W3C.  The first part is a SOAP 
message and the second contains the actual WMS response object as in (4a). 

(4c) (alternative with SOAP): the response is a SOAP message that includes the URL of 
the actual WMS response object as in (4a). 

7 Description of Request Messages 

The format of the request messages is normatively specified by Annex A.  This section 
points out several features of those messages. 

All requests include a service attribute.  For Web Map Service requests, a value of 
"WMS" must be used. 

7.1 GetCapabilities 

The GetCapabilities request includes an optional <Section> element to retrieve only one 
of the sections of a complete Capabilities XML document.  [It is intended that this 
document include a WSDL section as defined by OWS1 testbed.]  If the Section element 
is missing, the server must return the entire Capabilities XML document. The Section 
element includes an XPath [21] expression stating which part to retrieve.  At present, 
only a limited number of predefined XPath expressions are enumerated in the Schema; 
this specification uses the XPath syntax for compatibility but does not require that service 
instances support complete XPath parsing.  However, a service instance which accepts 
POST requests must understand the predefined XPath expressions and correctly return 
only the desired section of the document upon request.  The expression "/" refers to the 
entire document.  An expression of the form 
"/OGC_Capabilities/element_name" refers to the child called <element_name> 
in the <OGC_Capabilities> parent, including the <element_name> start tag, the 
</element_name> closing tag, and everything in between.

7.2 GetMap 

The GetMap request includes exactly one <StyledLayerDescriptor> element that defines 
the map layers which are to appear in the returned map.  Layers shall be drawn in the 
order that they appear in the XML, with the first one drawn at the bottom. 

When accessing a basic WMS as defined in Part 1 [17], the StyledLayerDescriptor 
element simply contains named Layer(s) and possibly named Style(s).  When accessing 
an SLD-enabled WMS as defined in [10], more complex expressions specifying user-
defined layer contents and styling are permitted.
