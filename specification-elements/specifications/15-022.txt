Abstract 

This OGC Engineering Report (ER) focuses on describing Common Security for all OGC 
Web Service Standards. This work was performed as part of the OGC Testbed 11 
activity1.  

Business Value 

The ability to describe Common Security across OGC Web Services standards enables the 
interoperable use of service instances to provide and share sensitive, high quality and 
high value geospatial information. The implementation of interoperable security 
definitions ensures use of protected OGC Web Services for many domains, including 
intelligence to commercial.

Testbed-11 Implementing Common Security Across the OGC 
Suite of Service Standards 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC Engineering Report (ER) focuses on describing Common Security for all OGC 
Web Service Standards. 

Before describing existing options, Common Security is in the context of OGC Web 
Services is first defined. 

Next, the ER analyzes the methods used by Web Services in general and OGC Web 
Services regarding the Publish/Find/Bind paradigm. The reader needs to understand that 
OGC Web Services use a slightly different Publish/Find/Bind approach than the general 
UDDI approach as outlined in section 5. 

In order to describe security constraints on OGC Web Services, the “common ground” 
for all service specifications needs to be analyzed in order to understand what options are 
available. In particular, to find at least one option to include security constraints in the 
service instance description is important. Additionally, in case there were multiple 
options, explaining when to favor one approach over another as well as shortcomings is 
important.  

Finally, this ER provides options on how to describe security constraints across different 
OGC Web Services standards, including a discussion of feasibility of the approaches. 

This ER concludes with recommendations to OGC standardization to describe Common 
Security.

4 Implementing Common Security overview 

4.1 Attempt to define Common Security 

The main objective of this ER is to describe Common Security for OGC Web Service 
standards. This can only be achieved if the generic term Common Security is defined. 

During past OGC Testbeds, a common understanding of the requirements regarding 
Common Security was established. We explicitly base this report on that definition from 
the OWS-6 ER ([1], section 6.2). Please note that the definition from [1], section 6.2 is 
using the security framework concept outlined in ISO 10-181 (all parts). ISO 10-1812 
introduces a flexible security framework for open interconnected systems that can be 
implemented in part or in full. 

Based on that definition, Common Security would require describing the constraints 
towards the following security requirements: 

Authentication Framework: ISO 10181-2 defines all basic concepts of authentication 
in Open Systems: It identifies different classes of authentication mechanisms, the 
services for their implementation and the requirements for supporting protocols. It 
further identifies requirements for the management of identity information. 

Access Control Framework: ISO 10181-3 defines all basic concepts for access control 
in Open Systems and the relation to other frameworks such as the Authentication and 
Audit Frameworks. 

Non-repudiation Framework: ISO 10181-4 refines and extends the concepts of non-
repudiation, given in ISO 7598-2. It further defines general non-repudiation services 
and the mechanisms to provide these services. 

Confidentiality Framework: ISO 10181-5 defines the basic concepts of confidentiality, 
identifies classes of confidentiality mechanisms and their maintenance. It further 
addresses the interactions of the confidentiality mechanisms with other services. 

Integrity Framework: ISO 10181-6 defines the basic concepts of integrity, identical to 
the Confidentiality Framework. 

Security Audits and Alarms Framework: ISO 10181-7 defines the basic concepts for 
security audit and alarms and the relationship to other security services. 

 

                                                

2 ISO 10181-1 describes an overview regarding the security framework defined in parts 2 – 7.

4.2 Applicability of the Frameworks for Common Security and OGC Web Services 

Because the goal of this ER is to describe Common Security for OGC Web Services, 
knowing which of the frameworks above need to be implemented and in particular which 
of the frameworks have implications to the client application accessing an OGC based 
Web Service or the “calling client” is important.  

Guidance for describing Common Security is only necessary for those frameworks that 
are (i) to be implemented and (ii) relevant for the calling client to know about and 
understand is reasonable. 

Authentication Framework: This framework can be implemented standalone but is 
typically required by other frameworks such as Access Control and Security Audits and 
Alarms Framework. Common use cases require its implementation for enabling (i) access 
control based on user characteristics and (ii) accountability such as auditing / logging of 
user information with a request / response.  

In the context of OGC Web Services, this framework is relevant and has direct 
implication to the calling client, as the execution of the service will only take place after 
successful authentication. 

Access Control Framework: This framework could be implemented standalone. If 
implemented without the Authentication framework, this does mean in particular that 
deriving access decisions must be undertaken without user information. For Web 
Services, the typical information available is coming from the computing environment: 
HTTP protocol, server hostname, request URL, service operation and parameters, date & 
time, requested resources, and IP address of the client. Typically, the Authentication 
framework is implemented and provides user information. Then, authorization decisions 
can be derived based on user information and the computing environment. 

In the context of OGC Web Services, the Authentication framework is relevant and has 
indirect implication to the calling client. Indirect means that the calling client may be able 
to execute the service endpoint but then the attempt of executing the actual service with 
provided parameters may result in access denied. 

As an example, a simple implementation of the Authentication Framework might imply 
access control to a Web Server path: the URI to access a service. Assuming the access 
control framework is implemented for /protected/ogc/service then the client is either able 
to bind to the service or not. In other words, the client is either able to execute any 
operation of the service (e.g. GetCapabilities, GetMap, GetFeatureInfo, etc.) or no 
operation at all. This is because all service operations are part of the query parameter that 
comes after the URI separator “?”.  

A more sophisticated example would be that the implementation of the access control 
framework is based on a complex GeoXACML policy that introduces fine-grained access 
control on subject attributes, service operation, resource characteristics and environment

information such as IP address of the client and the date. In this example, releasing the 
actual policy is important to the client as any subsequent execution attempt may result in 
“not authorized”. 

Non-repudiation Framework: This framework can be implemented standalone and 
independent from the other frameworks. This framework ensures for transactional 
services that an adversary cannot repeat the execution of an approved operation. The 
existence of this framework is usually not communicated to the calling client. 

In the context of OGC Web Services, the non-repudiation framework is not relevant, as 
the strict concept of transactions is not supported by OGC Web Services. Even though 
some OGC Web Services provide a write interface, and for the Web Feature Services this 
interface is named Transactional WFS, this interface provides create/delete/modify and 
not transactional operations. However, if a particular WFS-T instance shall support 
transactions, then the implementation of this framework does make sense.  

Confidentiality Framework: This framework can be implemented standalone and 
independent from the other frameworks. The existence of a Confidentiality framework 
has direct implication to the calling client, as the communication with the service must 
meet the established confidentiality requirements. 

In the context of OGC Web Services, this framework is relevant but can only be 
implemented with limitations, as outlined in the next sub-section.  

Integrity Framework: This framework can be implemented standalone and independent 
from the other frameworks. The existence of an Integrity framework has direct impact to 
the calling client, as the communication with the service must meet the established 
integrity requirements. 

In the context of OGC Web Services, this framework is relevant but can only be 
implemented with limitations, as outlined in the next sub-section. 

Security Audits and Alarms Framework: This framework can be implemented 
standalone and should always be implemented, as it guarantees the proper functioning of 
the security system and trigger administrative actions in case alarms are issued. 

Linking the implementation of this framework with OGC Web Services standards is 
difficult as such an implementation depends on the overall security policy. If the policy 
mandates a security watch-dog, then this framework must be implemented. The decision 
to implement is independent from the choice of service type.

The (Y) indicates that the implementation of this security framework introduces 
implications to the calling client but that the effect is not necessarily relevant to the 
programming logic of the client. The implication has effect on the user, as they may be 
challenged with different responses from the protected service: one request is permitted, 
the next perhaps denied. In the case where the client shall only issue those requests that 
will get permitted by the service, the client programming logic must read (and 
understand) the details of this framework’s implementation: The access control rules. 

The Y* indicates, that the implementation of this security framework is possible but with 
limitations as outlined in the next section 4.3. 

4.3 Variations of Implementing the Frameworks in the context of OGC Web Services 

In general, the communication between distributed systems and applications is based on 
the conceptual OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model (see [3] for details). This 
model is illustrated below. 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 11 
 

Figure 1 — OSI Model 

 

[Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Osi_model_trad.jpg] 

In this model, please note that the “Application” layer (also called layer 7) is still part of 
OSI model and does not represent the application (client or server program) itself. 
However, for OGC Web Services implementations, this layer includes the required 
communication protocol to be leveraged to make a service a Web service: HTTP. In that 
sense the usual case for implementing an OGC Web Service is using Operating System or 
other framework libraries that abstract communication over HTTP. 

Based on the general options of communication supported by HTTP (RFC 2616), two 
different approaches for encoding execution requests to an OGC Web Services evolved. 
The different approaches can best be characterized by analyzing the way in which the 
service operation parameters are submitted with the execution request: 

1) Structuring of operation parameters using URI encoding according to RFC 2396 
also known as Key-Value-Pair or query string is the simplest way supported. The 
approach leverages the HTTP GET method to connect to the service endpoint and 
to submit the service parameters. Even this simple approach is very powerful and 
can quickly be implemented. This approach has limitations in expressiveness of 
the parameters. When using this approach with secure service endpoints and 
according3 to RFC 2396, it is explicitly recommended to not put any secure / 
confidential information such as username or password in the query string. One 
dominant reason is that the URL + query string is typically captured in Web 
Server log files. 

                                                

3 “It is clearly unwise to use a URL that contains a password which is intended to be secret … except in those rare 
cases where the ’password’ parameter is intended to be public.”

2) An improvement over KVP is to use XML encoded requests. This relaxes the 
limitations on expressiveness introduced by KVP. In order to submit XML 
encoded service parameters, the HTTP method POST is used. 

From these general options with HTTP to submit service parameters for OGC Web 
Services, three main implementation categories evolved: XML, SOAP and KVP. 

4.3.1 Category I: HTTP+KVP 

This category of implementations of OGC Web Services mainly uses the HTTP protocol 
plus the GET verb provided by RFC 1616 to communicate with the service endpoint. In 
addition, the full use of RFC 2396 URIs including the query string is possible. Please 
note that this category also supports REST and RESTful approaches. 

The biggest advantage is at the same time a disadvantage: simplicity. An additional 
disadvantage for using KVP is the different implementations regarding the maximum 
length of the URL+query string. This implies a fundamental restriction on the use of 
HTTP GET + KVP.  



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 13 
 

Table 2 — HTTP/1.1 citation on URI limitation (RC 2616, 3.2.1) 
The HTTP protocol does not place any a priori limit on the length of 
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle the URI of any resource they 
serve, and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of unbounded length if they 
provide GET-based forms that could generate such URIs. A server 
SHOULD return 414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a URI is longer 
than the server can handle (see section 10.4.15). 
 
   Note: Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI lengths 
   above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy 
   implementations might not properly support these lengths. 

 

Is there a maximum length conclusion for a client? No. From different sources on the 
Internet, different answers are available about URI length limitations: Internet Explorer 
seems to limit URIs to 2083 characters. This limitation in particular implies a problem 
with data URLs: data:image/jpeg;base64,/….  

A typical OGC Web Service request leveraging HTTP GET + KVP looks like this: 

http://localhost/noa/basic?SERVICE=WFS&VERSION=1.1.0& 
REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=mda%3Anoticeofarrival& 
NAMESPACE=xmlns%28mda%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Frelease.niem.gov%2Fniem%2Fd
omains%2Fmaritime%2F3.0%2Fmda%2F%29&  
OUTPUTFORMAT=text%2Fxml%3B subtype%3Dgml%2F3.1.1 

 

Looking at the different types of OGC Web Services, it seems that the URI limitation has 
only impact to specifications like CSW, WCS and WFS that support the use of OGC 
Filter Encoding. And the actual filter statement could become quite lengthy and exceed 
the quasi de facto length limit of 2083 characters. As an example, let’s consider an 
example from the OGC Filter Encoding v1.1 specification [3]: 

Table 3 — Example 14 from OGC 04-095 (Filter Encoding) 
<Filter> 
    <And> 
        <Within>

                        <gml:posList>-98.5485,24.2633 ...</gml:posList> 
                    </gml:LinearRing>

    </And> 
</Filter>

And, applying this example Filter to the example WFS GetFeature from above using only 
one typeName has the length of 1016 characters already:

When completing the geometry with the simple state boundary for California (110 point 
locations), the request URI becomes 7718 characters in length (read part over the 2083

Category II: HTTP+XML 

This category leverages the HTTP protocol for the communication basis and submits the 
service operation parameters, including any Filter, encoded in XML via HTTP POST and 
mime type text/xml.  

The obvious example is that this approach overcomes the simplicity constraint from KVP 
and the size limitation of the URI. However, there usually is also a size limit for the 
content-length when POSTing information to a Web Server. But that limit typically is 
2MB or more and can be configured in the Web Server setup. 

Also, from the Web Server log file perspective the use of POSTed XML requests has the 
advantage compared to the GET KVP approach that the XML request is not recorded by 
default. But of course, the logging of XML encoded requests is also possible.  

The big disadvantage of using XML requests is the issue of carrying attacks and 
malicious code as well as replay requests. Therefore, XML validation should be enabled 
and XML content inspection. 

The GetFeature request from above using HTTP GET+KVP looks like the following, 
using HTTP POST+XML: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<wfs:GetFeature 
    service="WFS"

4.3.2 Category III: HTTP+SOAP 

This category leverages the HTTP protocol for the communication basis and submits the 
service operation parameters in the <Body> part of the XML encoded SOAP message. 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 19 
 

The <Header> part becomes available to introduce options for mainly implementing the 
Integrity and Confidentiality frameworks by leveraging the WS-* stack. 

4.4 Applying Common Security to the different Implementation Options 

4.4.1 Category I: HTTP+KVP 

4.4.1.1 Authentication 

The HTTP 1.1 protocol (as per RFC 1616) supports the use of HTTP authentication via 
the HTTP status code 401. Typically, the use of HTTP authentication with the methods 
BASIC and DIGEST, as defined in RFC 2617, can be used. As the username and 
password are submitted with the request as clear text within the HTTP header attribute 
“Authorization” the implementation of HTTP Authentication on HTTP is not 
recommended. Even though DIGEST improves BASIC by the use of nonce values to 
prevent reply attacks, HTTP Authentication should only be used with secure HTTP 
communication, as introduced by RFC 2818 (HTTP over TLS). In this sense, the 
independent implementation of the Authentication Framework is not recommended. 

It is important to note that the approach of using HTTP Authentication is not limited to 
the use of BASIC and DIGEST.  

4.4.1.2 Access Control 

The HTTP protocol (as per RFC 1616) supports the implementation of the Access 
Control framework by the concept of “Deny” through the status code 403. Which rules 
are applied on the service hosting side to determine that the request results in a 403 rather 
a status code of 200 must not be specified. This leaves freedom for any service instance 
to implement access control according to the individual need per service instance and 
endpoint operation. However, this introduces a burden to advertise as outlined in a later 
section. 

The independent implementation of the Access Control framework is possible as long 
authorization decisions are based on the HTTP request context. The context typically 
includes information about the environment, the calling client and the requested resource. 
In cases where Access Control shall be based on information about the calling client in 
terms of authentication or identity information, the Authentication framework must also 
be implemented. Keep in mind that the implementation of the Access Control framework 
itself does not require to implement secure communication, but when used in 
combination with Authentication, secure communication is recommended. So in essence, 
one should always implement access control plus authentication with HTTP over TLS. 

4.4.1.3 Integrity / Confidentiality 

The HTTP protocol supports encrypted communication of the transport layer by 
leveraging the RFC 2818. This introduces the protocol scheme https that essentially is 
HTTP over TLS. As illustrated in figure 1 (OSI Model), TLS applies encryption to the 



OGC 15-022 

20 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Transport Layer of the communication stack. That enables to use HTTP unchanged, as it 
“lives” on a higher layer in the communication stack; in the Application Layer. 

As standardized in HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2616), a HTTP URL has the following structure:  

"http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]] [12], section 3.2.2 

Therefore, the actual OGC Web Service requests using HTTP+KVP does look identical 
regardless if HTTP or HTTPS is being used! 

This “secure channel” communication provides confidentiality limited to the channel and 
therefore provides confidentiality from point-to-point rather than end-to-end. Also, the 
URL itself is not confidential, as it is not part of the communication channel.  

In cases where the Integrity of the Confidentiality framework shall be applied to the 
HTTP+KVP, the query string or individual keys or key-value-pairs must be encrypted 
accordingly. 

4.4.2 Category II: HTTP+XML 

4.4.2.1 Authentication 

The implementation of this framework is identical to the one for Category I.  

4.4.2.2 Access Control 

The implementation of this framework is identical to the one for Category I.  

4.4.2.3 Integrity / Confidentiality 

The implementation of these frameworks can easily be established by leveraging HTTP 
over TLS, as described for the Category I. The use of XML encoded requests is an 
improvement over the use of KVP, as the entire request is secretly sent through the secure 
communication channel. However, limitations in terms of point-to-point apply and must 
be considered in particular when crafting workflows or communicating over proxies. 

The following figure illustrates the basic point-to-point limitation when leveraging secure 
communication based on TLS. The information item is “secure” as long as it resides in 
the secure communication channel between the client and service endpoints. Once the 
information (XML) reaches the receiver (service in the example below), it is available in 
clear text.

4.4.3 Category III: HTTP+SOAP 

4.4.3.1 Authentication 

For the implementation of this framework, two options exist. The first is identical to the 
one for Category I by leveraging the HTTP protocol options. The second is based on the 
implementation of the Integrity Framework. When using WS-Security to apply Digital 
Signatures to ensure integrity of SOAP encoded requests, it is not required that the key 
can be associated with an identity. For implementing the Authentication framework on 
top of the Integrity framework, a private key would be used to apply a digital signature, 
and the key is associated with the senders (service calling client’s) identity. 

4.4.3.2 Access Control 

The implementation of this framework is identical to the one for Category I.  

4.4.3.3 Integrity / Confidentiality 

The implementation of these frameworks can (and should) take place independent from 
the HTTP options using TLS. The strength of SOAP encoded requests over simple XML 
encoded requests is that WS-Security (and other applicable standards of that stack) can be 
used to individually ensure integrity and/or confidentiality of the request as a whole or in 
parts. The use of W3C’s XML Digital Signatures and XML Encryption provide a large 
flexibility with the risk of lack of interoperability. 

Compared to HTTP over TLS, the encrypted XML stays with integrity and 
confidentiality, even when it has reached the receiver (service in the example below):

Figure 3 — Message Level Security 

 

However, when using WS-Security, a strong need exists to advertise the constraints 
regarding integrity and confidentiality to the calling client. This can be undertaken by 
using additional standards of the WS-* family like WS-Policy, WS-SecurityPolicy and 
WS-PolicyAttachment. The following figure illustrates major building blocks of the WS-
* family. 

Figure 4 — WS-* Family (major building blocks)

4.5 Implications from the different implementation variations 

An OGC Web Service endpoint that is capable of supporting HTTP+KVP and 
HTTP+XML or even HTTP+SOAP introduces a noticeable challenge to security, 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 23 
 

because the state transfer from HTTP+KVP request to HTTP+XML to HTTP+KVP must 
be maintained and the implementation of the different frameworks must ensure identical 
assurance. This seems to be difficult considering the fact that XML encoded requests are 
much more expressive then KVP encoded requests. In that sense, a secured 
implementation of an OGC Web Service should advertise the appropriate HTTP method: 
HTTP Get or Post and if applicable both. However for the client side, it is recommended 
to only use one HTTP method (GET or POST) once a security session is initiated. This 
relaxes the conditions to implement a security framework. 

The use of HTTP+SOAP introduces the option to leverage message security a là WS-
Security which introduces multiple options with regard to which parts of the request 
XML must be encrypted, which must be digitally signed, which algorithm to use, which 
key length to use, etc. etc. This seems to immediately break the hardly achieved 
interoperability with OGC Web Service standards that describe how to call a service for a 
particular purpose. From that perspective, if you wish to implement OGC Web Services 
using the Integrity and Encryption frameworks and want simple interoperability, then you 
should not use SOAP and WS-Security unless all services run inside a controlled 
security domain and you have full control over the “what” gets encrypted and how. In 
addition, a detailed service description using WSDL and WS-Policy must be available to 
instrument proper implementation on the client. For a complete example on all the parts 
that must play together, please use the link below the figure 4 (above). 

With the new hype of mobile clients to be used as geospatial platforms, the use of SOAP 
and even XML seems to raise additional concerns that should be explored further in 
future research. 

4.6 Need for Interoperable Description of the Common Security Constraints 

In the context of OGC Web Services it is important that the calling client understands the 
constraints of a service instance implied by the implementation of the introduced security 
frameworks. As summarized in table 1, it should be possible to describe the existence of 
those security framework implementations that have an impact on the client. In particular, 
the ability to describe the existence of a single framework being implemented or any 
(meaningful) combination must be possible. 

From table 1, the client needs to “know” about the existence of the authentication, access 
control and integrity / confidentiality frameworks. The existence of the non-repudiation 
and the audit and alarms frameworks is not of concern to be reported to the client. 

In addition to the general ability to define the existence of a security framework, it must 
certainly be possible to describe the existence of security framework(s) per service 
instance. For OGC Web Services, you must be able to describe security implications per 
service operation. Examples of unrestricted (unprotected) operations may include 
GetCapabilities, GetLeganedGraphics, DescribeFeatureType. Examples of service 
operations that are target for getting protected are GetMap, GetFeature, Transaction, etc.

5 Determine the best place for advertising Common Security constraints 

In order to determine the best place for advertising security constrains, reflecting the 
security in place at a service instance, understanding the general IT Publish-Find-Bind 
paradigm and in particular the OGC implementation of that paradigm is required. 

5.1 Publish-Find-Bind using Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) 

Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) is a model that uses XML based 
registries where a service provider can publish (UDDI) compliant descriptions of a web 
offering, e.g. a Web Service. The description usually comprises a set of documents, each 
crafted for a different purpose. In order to support best the find and bind, UDDI provides 
Yellow, White and Green pages. Of particular interest are the Green Pages, which include 
the technically relevant documents to implement the interface of the service. 

Without going into the full detail of the UDDI process, please note in the context of this 
report that the final outcome of the Find process is a WSDL document that describes the 
offering properly to build a client that is capable to execute the service in the Bind phase. 

Security constraints of the offering that effect the Bind is therefore (obviously) best 
included into the WSDL document. This can take place by using XLinks to external 
descriptions using WS-Policy.  

The use of WS-Policy closes the loop with the original concept to use SOAP for Web 
Service communication; so the use of WSDL, SOAP encoded service requests, integrity 
and confidentiality implemented using WS-Security and WS-Policy to describe the 
SOAP message requirements is the natural choice. 

The following examples illustrate an example WS-Policy and a WSDL that uses the WS-
Policy:

5.2 Publish-Find-Bind in the OGC World 

When studying the concept of OGC Web Services and the approach to Publish-Find-
Bind, one will find that the established procedure is different than UDDI. 

Because the goal of this ER is to find options to describe Common Security across all 
OGC Web Service standards and make recommendations on the best option(s) is(are), 
studying the OGC way of Publish-Find-Bind in more detail is essential. 

5.2.1 OGC Publish 

For OGC Web Service instances, typically two types of descriptions are uploaded to a 
registry:  

1) An ISO-19115 compliant metadata document that focuses on describing the 
dataset 

2) An ISO compliant metadata document that focuses on describing the actual 
service instance with a link to the ISO metadata for served the data set 

From the perspective of Common Security, the description of the data set is not of any 
concern, as it has no implications to the actual Bind process. However, license and use 
restrictions on the data set might be in place and must be honored when receiving the data 
via the providing service. 

The interesting bit from the perspective of Common Security is the ISO metadata 
description for the service instance. The options available to include or link to security 
constraint description of implemented frameworks are addressed in more detail in a later 
section of this ER. 

5.2.2 OGC Find 

The find process usually involves querying a CSW, which is able to search one or 
multiple registries of ISO-19115 compliant metadata records. The result of a find process 
is one or many ISO metadata file(s). Each file either describes characteristics of a data set 
or a service instance. 

Notice that the result of the OGC Find process is not a WSDL document that enables a 
developer to implement a client. Instead, the ISO metadata file contains the service base 
URL that enables the client to execute the GetCapabilities operation. The result of the 
GetCapabilities operation (the Capabilities document) enables the client to fully bind 
with the service. 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 27 
 

In case that Common Security is in place for the service, these constraints can be 
advertised in both documents: (i) the ISO metadata and (ii) the OGC Capabilities 
document. However, taking under consideration that the metadata file is used of human 
consumption, it is not necessary to encode the constraints introduced by the Common 
Security to be machine-readable. However, this can’t hurt as using machine-readable 
encoding enables to properly visualize the service characteristics to the user, in particular 
the existing security constraints. Because the client always uses the service base URL and 
the GetCapabilities operation to bind with the service instance, the ability to describe 
Common Security constraints inside the Capabilities document in a machine-readable 
fashion seems to be mandatory. 

5.2.3 OGC Bind 

In the OGC world, the actual Bind to an OGC Web Services does not take place using a 
WSDL as for the UDDI approach. Instead, a service instance specific Capabilities file is 
used. Beside other pieces of information, the Capabilities file outlines the options to 
execute service operations. The Capabilities file provides insight into the accepted 
options for packaging a service request (HTTP+KVP, HTTP+POST, HTTP+SOAP) and 
outlines the possible data types returned. This information is provided per service 
operation, similar to WSDL. 

As the capabilities document is encoded as an XML instance document containing all the 
information for a calling client to bind to the service, this seems to be the natural place to 
put the security constraints as required to describe the implemented frameworks 
regarding Common Security. There is not an option for all different versions of the 
Capabilities document (as we will see in a later section) to describe or hook security 
constraints descriptions in the Capabilities document. 

6 Exploring existing options in ISO Metadata based on an Example 

Note: The intention of this chapter is not to criticize but to make clear the difficulties of 
using the currently available options! 

This chapter illustrates an example approach that leverages the ISO 19115 metadata 
options for outlining constraints. In order to understand the limitations of existing 
options, and to better understand the need / requirements to improve the options and the 
process, let’s study an INSPIRE6 offering from the Bavarian SDI.

As the Publish element of the web services model is not relevant for this ER, let’s start 
with the Find step. The search can be conducted from the Bavarian SDI portal7: 
http://geoportal.bayern.de/geoportalbayern/  

For this example, we are looking for the topographic map of Munich in the scale 
1:50.000. Typing “DTK50 München” into the search box can fetch the results. The 
following figure is a screenshot, displaying the response.  

Figure 5 — GDI Bavaria example to illustrate WMS restrictions 

 

As we can see, the portal page illustrates various characteristics for two options how to 
obtain a topographic map for Munich in the scale of 1:50.000:

Google automatic translation.

1) The first response is an OGC WMS of version 1.1.1. From the symbols used, you 
can clearly determine that access control is in place (red lock). You can also 
determine that there is a fee involved to use it (EUR symbol) and that there are 
use restrictions (Creative Commons symbol). 

2) The second response is an ATOM Feed (INSPIRE Download Service). From the 
symbols used, you can clearly determine that it is open but that a fee is involved. 

Where do the triggers for displaying the symbols come from? The editor expects that the 
visualization for the View Service (first hit) is based on the ISO metadata document for 
that service instance that can be obtained from this URL8: 
http://geoportal.bayern.de/geoportalbayern/detailpage?10-1.ILinkListener-
detailOverview-downloadLink&resId=9690a6e4-8903-4ff5-b739-355b4b03d72f  

Taking a closer look at the metadata, we find the following XML snippet that is 
responsible for the different symbols:

6.1 The Red Lock Symbol 

One could simply conclude that the red lock symbol indicates Access Control, which is 
quite right even though the mouse over help reads “with authentication”. From the ISO 
metadata document, the following snippet must have triggered that symbol: 

<gmd:MD_RestrictionCode codeList=".../ML_gmxCodelists.xml#MD_RestrictionCode" 
codeListValue="otherRestrictions">otherRestrictions</gmd:MD_RestrictionCode> 

 

This construct helps to visualize a “red lock” but as there is no semantics to explain what 
a user must do or a developer must implement to overcome the security constraint, this 
XML element has not enough information. One could link the next XML element even 
though the name is very general “otherConstraints” with the “otherRestriction”: 

<gmd:otherConstraints> 
            <gco:CharacterString>Nutzungsbedingungen: Für den Zugang zum 
kostenpflichtigen Dienst benötigen Sie eine Kennung und ein Passwort. Diese Zugangsdaten 
erhalten Sie über den Kundenservice. Informationen zu den Preisen des Dienstes entnehmen

gelten die Nutzungsbedingungen der Bayerischen Vermessungsverwaltung 
(https://geoportal.bayern.de/geodatenonline/seiten/nutzungsbedingungen).</gco:CharacterS
tring> 
        </gmd:otherConstraints> 

 

The obvious limitation is that in an international ISO metadata document, you find 
German text explaining that you need an account with them, which will require a fee 
according to their terms of use and fees. A non-German speaker would have difficulty 
understanding what the issue is. Therefore, this approach is incomplete and lacks in 
interoperability. 

6.2 The € Symbol 

This symbol clearly implies that you need to pay money to use the service. Or is the fee 
for obtaining the actual map? From the ISO metadata document, the following snippet 
might have triggered that symbol: 

<gmd:distributionOrderProcess> 
    <gmd:MD_StandardOrderProcess> 
        <gmd:fees> 
            <gco:CharacterString>geldleistungspflichtig</gco:CharacterString> 
        </gmd:fees> 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 31 
 

    </gmd:MD_StandardOrderProcess> 
</gmd:distributionOrderProcess> 

 

Or, maybe this XML snippet: 

<gmd:useConstraints> 
    <gmd:MD_RestrictionCode codeList=".../ML_gmxCodelists.xml#MD_RestrictionCode" 
codeListValue="license">license</gmd:MD_RestrictionCode> 
</gmd:useConstraints> 

 

Similar to the description of “otherRestrictions”, there is no fine-grained semantics with 
this element. But assuming that the previous XML element in the metadata is linked even 
tough the element name reads “useLimitation” and not “fee”, we get some semantics: 

<gmd:useLimitation> 
    <gco:CharacterString>Nutzungsbedingungen: Für den Zugang zum kostenpflichtigen 
Dienst benötigen Sie eine Kennung und ein Passwort. Diese Zugangsdaten erhalten Sie über 
den Kundenservice. Informationen zu den Preisen des Dienstes entnehmen Sie der

Nutzungsbedingungen der Bayerischen Vermessungsverwaltung 
(https://geoportal.bayern.de/geodatenonline/seiten/nutzungsbedingungen).</gco:CharacterS
tring> 
</gmd:useLimitation> 

 

The provided text (response) is written in German (again) and does not really explain to 
the user what the fee is. As for the “Red Lock”, this approach seem incomplete with a 
lack of interoperability. 

6.3 The CC Symbol 

As for the previous symbols, one can easily find a trigger in the ISO metadata: 

<gmd:useConstraints> 
    <gmd:MD_RestrictionCode codeList=".../ML_gmxCodelists.xml#MD_RestrictionCode" 
codeListValue="license">license</gmd:MD_RestrictionCode> 
</gmd:useConstraints> 

 

However, determining which CC license this service has in place is not easy. Or is the 
data set served with a particular CC license? From the ISO metadata, we find no 
additional information and in particular not a link to a CC license as we would have 
expected. 

If the above assumption is correct, how can we link the following XML snippet to a 
meaningful security constraint? 

<gmd:MD_LegalConstraints> 
    <gmd:accessConstraints> 
        <gmd:MD_RestrictionCode codeList=".../ML_gmxCodelists.xml#MD_RestrictionCode" 
codeListValue="copyright">copyright</gmd:MD_RestrictionCode> 



OGC 15-022 

32 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

    </gmd:accessConstraints> 
</gmd:MD_LegalConstraints> 

 

The XML element tag reads “accessConstraints” but the ISO restriction code points to 
“copyright”, which might not be the expected content for everyone. 

6.4 Study of the Security Indicators for the Download Service 

The second response in the screenshot above shows a green and open lock, which 
indicates open and unconstrained access. There also is a fee symbol. How does that fit 
together: An open service with fee constraints? 

In order to understand the mechanics behind, let’s take a closer look at the ISO metadata 
document that can be obtained via this URL: 
http://geoportal.bayern.de/geoportalbayern/detailpage?11-1.ILinkListener-
detailOverview-downloadLink&resId=b6fca3d5-21b1-33c5-ab45-c67708751076  

From that metadata document, the only XML snippet that could have triggered the € 
symbol is the following: 

<gmd:distributionOrderProcess> 
    <gmd:MD_StandardOrderProcess> 
        <gmd:fees> 
            <gco:CharacterString>geldleistungspflichtig</gco:CharacterString> 
        </gmd:fees> 
        <gmd:orderingInstructions> 
            <gco:CharacterString>Der Downloaddienst auf die Digitale Topographische Karte 
1:50000 steht auf Anfrage zur Verfügung. Zur Nutzung des Dienstes benötigen Sie eine 
Kennung und ein Passwort. Wenden Sie sich hierfür bitte an unseren 
Kundenservice.</gco:CharacterString> 
        </gmd:orderingInstructions> 
    </gmd:MD_StandardOrderProcess> 
</gmd:distributionOrderProcess> 

 

The existence of the <gmd:fees> element is a clear indication. Please note that there are no 
further “Constraint” elements in the metadata document. In particular, there is no access, 
legal or use constraint. However, the other element right after the <gmd:fees>  element 
contains important information, unfortunately in German only! The text clearly states that 
this Download Service will provide links to obtain a topographic map with scale 1:50000 
via a Viewing Service. And for that access you do need an account. Further information 
can be obtained from customer service but no contact details are provided! 

When following the Download Service using the provided link 
(http://www.geodaten.bayern.de/inspire/dls/dtk50.xml) and a specific link for the 
Download Service for Munich 
(http://www.geodaten.bayern.de/inspire/dls/dtk50.DEBY_89fd9293-9c78-39f5-a34d-
914ff4443d22.xml), a list of View Services becomes available. Selecting the View 



OGC 15-022

Service for obtaining the topographic map of Munich9, the service returns a HTTP status 
code 401. This indicates that a username and password is required with the service 
provider, as we can derive from the login box. 

Figure 6 — HTTP Basic Login 

 

This example seems to be incomplete, as at the end the same restrictions apply as per 
information for the service itself. However, these restrictions were not displayed in the 
beginning. 

6.5 Study of the ISO Metadata for an open View Service 

The following screenshot illustrates that the View Service is a WMS of version 1.1.1 that 
has no security constraints:

Figure 7 — GDI Bavaria example to illustrate Atom Feed restrictions 

 

The green lock indicates no access control and no authentication; the negative EUR 
symbol indicates that no fees are involved. However, there are supposed to be license 
restrictions as indicated by the Creative Commons symbol. Taking a closer look at the 
underlying ISO metadata (http://geoportal.bayern.de/geoportalbayern/detailpage?4-
1.ILinkListener-detailOverview-downloadLink&resId=29b23ebc-16ff-46d9-88c8-
c5141db30547) unveils that there are “Constraint” elements, which we did not expect to 
find due to the green lock:

        </gmd:otherConstraints> 
    </gmd:MD_LegalConstraints> 
</gmd:resourceConstraints> 

 

We find the exact same elements in the ISO metadata document as for the View Service 
with the Red Lock and the € symbol. In particular, we find the constraint 
“otherRestrictions” present as well as “license” and “copyright”. However, the content 
one of the “otherConstraints” element now contain a cryptic content that seem to express 
a particular CC license for the “Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung”, even though this 
organization doesn’t exist any longer (their successor organization is the “Landesamt für 
Digitalisierung, Breitband und Vermessung“) and the provided link does result in HTTP 
404.  

Taking a look at the Capabilities document for the service unveils that both constraints 
are in place: Fees and AccessConstraints. 

6.6 Misuse of <Fees> and <AccessConstraints> in the Capabilities document 

As shown in this example, a common practice is that the XML elements Fees and 
AccessConstraints in the Capabilities document are not used in a standard compliant way. 

For this example, where the portal screenshot indicates no access constraints (green lock), 
the Capabilities document indicates something different: 

<Fees>Kostenfrei (mit allen Rechten)</Fees> 

<AccessConstraints>Siehe Nr. 3.1 unter 
http://geoportal.bayern.de/geoportalbayern/inhalte/nutzungsbedingungen.html</AccessConst
raints> 

 



OGC 15-022 

36 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

But according to the OGC WMS 1.1.1 specification, the only valid content of the element 
<Fees> and <AccessContraints> in case there are no fees or restrictions imposed is the 
string literal none. Interesting, also note that the content of the <AccessContraints> 
element refers to use restrictions and not to the actual access restrictions such as 
authentication or access control limitations. 

This leads to the conclusion that the existing hooks for describing the security constraints 
in an ISO metadata document exist but are difficult to use, in particular in a consistent 
fashion. Also, the use of options in the capabilities response document that there are not 
proper hooks provided to describe common security constraints. 

6.7 Lessons learned and Shortcomings of the example approach 

The first observation that has nothing to do with the actual advertisement of security, 
license, use and fee constraints is that the entire process of obtaining information is very 
difficult to understand and requires a certain understanding of the bits and pieces that link 
together to provide all the puzzle pieces to get the complete understanding. One particular 
observation indicates that the process is also difficult for the provider side as different 
metadata files provide different details at different places that partly contradict or are 
incomplete. 

Regarding the use of security constraints, the use of provided options from the ISO 
metadata seem to be difficult to understand, may not be interoperable with descriptions 
from other providers. The provided information is not sufficient to properly bind to the 
server. 

For the given example, it is difficult to understand the requirements for the Bind. For the 
Download Service, there is no Capabilities document but an Atom Feed XML document. 
And for the Viewing Service, there is no Capabilities document available either as the 
GetCapabilities operation is not open; in fact that operation also requires an account to 
login. 

The Atom feed document leverages yet another mechanism to advertise constraints using 
the following construct in the instance document of the feed:

Again, we find terms of use information and fee information (in German) that differs 
from the text used in the ISO metadata.

The general conclusion we can make from the example is that there is confusion on how 
to properly describe security constraints for OGC Web Services based on the currently 
available options. Description of security constraints is difficult to understand, 
insufficient or not fit for purpose and scattered among different documents: Pieces can be 
found in ISO metadata, Atom feed description documents and in the Capabilities 
document and these are inconsistent. 

Further, consider that the description of security constraints is pretty useless when it 
comes to users that prefer Google for the shortcut to bind to OGC Web Services, even 
knowing that this is not the proper process. The simplistic use of the Capabilities 
document (either via bookmark or GetCapabilities) operations is used. This shortcut is 
also supported by the general desktop GIS implementations. Setting up OGC Web 
Services in mapping projects does not involve assessing the ISO metadata. Setup can 
simply happen from the Capabilities document. These observations recommend that any 
security constraints be advertised solely in the Capabilities document.  

7 The Capabilities document and the options to describe security constraints 

The general problem with the approach to describe security constraints in the ISO 
metadata is that shortcuts in the GetCapabilities document as the general OGC Bind is 
implemented in clients. This voids the entire approach to use the ISO metadata to 
advertise security constraints. 

The important question at hand is if there are options in the Capabilities file to describe 
Common Security, in particular describe implementation details for the different 
frameworks outlined in the ISO 10181 series. Additionally, if there were options to 
describe the security constraints, is the information sufficient and fit for purpose? 

In order to determine the options in the Capabilities document, we first study the basic 
mechanics of OGC standardization for Web Services. 

7.1 Commonalities across OGC Web Services 

The first essential question is to evaluate if a common place could exist in the OGC Web 
Services standards world that defines how to advertise security constraints in a 
Capabilities document.  Such a common specification would automatically provide all 
service standards the ability to inherit from that specification. 

Those familiar with OGC Web Service standards would expect that the natural place for 
commonalities across the Web Service standards is OWS Common. A closer look at this 
issue quickly shows that this is not quite so.

Currently, there are four different version of OWS Common in use one of which is 
deprecated. This clearly indicates that the description of Common Security cannot simply 
be integrated into one single, commonly used base standard. For example, WMS 1.3 
version – as an ISO standard – does not even link to OWS Common; WMS 1.3 has 
relevant parts from OWS Common restated in the normative text in the WMS document. 
However, from reading the standard, which version of OWS Common was used is not 
obvious. 

7.2 Study of OGC Standards regarding Common Security 

For describing Common Security requirements with OGC Web Services, we need to 
determine if any security related standards are normatively referenced from the involved 
standards. Further we need to check that no general IT requirements are overwritten 
which would prevent the use of general IT security / communication security standards as 
well as common libraries. 

7.2.1 OGC Web Services Common Specifications 

As OGC OWS Common is meant as a placeholder standard for “common things” across 
the Web Services standards, let’s study what the baseline for general IT standards and 
communication is about. This is the fundament necessary to build on top the Common 
Security. 

7.2.1.1 OWS Common Version 1.0.0 

OWS Common, version 1.0 is skipped here because only CSW 2.0.2 is linking it. 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 39 
 

7.2.1.2 OWS Common Version 1.1.0 

OWS Common, version 1.1.0 is a normative base for the following OGC Web Services: 
SOS 1.0, SOS 2.0, SPS 2.0, WFS 2.0.2, WMTS 1.0.0, WPS 1.0.0 

For OWS Common, version 1.1.0 the general HTTP communication behavior is based on 
a normative reference to IETF RFC 2616. This limits communication to HTTP/1.1 and 
supporting secure communication via HTTPS (HTTP + TLS) is not mandatory for an 
implementation. 

This version of OWS Common does not have a normative reference to IETF RF 2109 
(HTTP Cookies). The fact that a service shall be stateless seems to be the goal, but the 
lack of HTTP Cookies disables the ability to establish communication/service sessions in 
a common and practical manner. As secured services are usually no longer stateless 
(there typically is a user or client context to maintain), the option of using HTTP Cookies 
is not given. 

Exception reporting is limited to XML encoded exceptions using the “exceptionCode” 
mechanism with a pre-defined set of error codes with the HTTP code 200. It is unclear if 
the use of other status codes from the referenced RFC 2616 can be leveraged. In 
particular, 101, 302, 401, 403, 404, 500 are important to consider10. 

7.2.1.3 OWS Common Version 2.0 

The main difference of version 2.0 over version 1.1.0 seems to be the option to use SOAP 
encoded messages for service in/output. So the limitation of HTTP communication (no 
TLS and not Cookies) and status codes remains. 

Even though SOAP is enabled for OWS Common 2.0, the lack of enabling the WS-* 
stack of standards disable the implementation of confidentiality and integrity on service 
instances. 

7.2.2 OGC Web Map Service Implementation Specification, version 1.3 

Even though it is unclear if elements of WMS 1.3 were copied from a particular version 
of the OWS Common specification or introduced as the “common requirements”, the 
same HTTP limitations as in OWS Common 1.1.0 exist: No HTTPS, no HTTP Cookies 
and no use of HTTP status codes other than 200. 

7.2.3 Exception Codes 

Common to OWS Common and WMS 1.3 is that the defined exception codes (to be 
encoded in XML) lack any security related definitions. So, for example, there is no code 
403 “access denied” or 401 “authentication required”. In difference to (or as an

improvement) to OWS Common 1.1.0, WMS 1.3 introduces its own extension to the 
exception handling from OWS Common: 

“Errors may arise in software modules other than those which implement the WMS, and 
may result in exception messages other than those defined by this International Standard. 
For example, when an error condition occurs in the local computing environment of the 
WMS server instance (e.g. out of memory or disk space), the server may be unable to 
process the WMS request and may issue an error message. Or, upon receiving a request 
that is invalid according to the rules of the Distributed Computing Platform in use, the 
server may issue a service exception of a type valid in that DCP (e.g. if the URL prefix is 
incorrect, an HTTP 404 status code (IETF RFC 2616) may be sent).”[WMS 1.3]  

The last sentence is unclear: Does the use of HTTP status codes overwrite the use of 
XML encoded WMS exception reporting? The term “may” is not helpful here! 

And, how about the use of security related HTTP status codes, like 401, 403?  

7.2.4 Expressiveness of Capabilties document of different OGC Web Services 

Based on the many different versions of OWS Common and the OGC WMS standard not 
linking to OWS Common, there are many different versions with different levels of 
expressiveness when it comes to the OGC Capabilities documents. 

7.2.4.1 WMS 1.1.1 

WMS version 1.1 was standardized before OWS Common. 

The WMS Capabilities for this version is based on DTD; no schema. This DTD includes 
elements to express access constraints and fees via the following elements: 

<!ELEMENT Fees (#PCDATA)> 
<!ELEMENT AccessConstraints (#PCDATA)> 

 

Furthermore, it is possible to define vendor specific parameters according to the 
following element definitions: 

<!ELEMENT Capability  
          (Request, Exception, VendorSpecificCapabilities?, 
    UserDefinedSymbolization?, Layer?) > 

 
In particular, the VendorSpecificCapabilities is not defined in detail. 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 41 
 

7.2.4.2 WMS 1.3.0 

The WMS Capabilities for this version is based on an XML Schema11 that is not linked to 
OWS Common. 

The schema allows, as for 1.1.1, the definition of Fees and AccessContraints as well as 
extended Capabilities (vendor specific capabilities). This mechanism is used to advertise 
the INSPIRE specific version of the Capabilities. 

Further, note that the WMS XSD constrains the definition of the protocol scheme for 
service instance endpoints to “http” and allows methods to “Get” and “Post”. The 
constraint to use HTTP prevents to service a WMS instance on HTTPS. This has the 
implication that you cannot even put a security proxy in from of the WMS 1.3 that 
mandates HTTPS, as you cannot define that in a standards compliant way. 

7.2.4.3 WMTS 1.0 

The WMTS Capabilities seem to have same expressiveness as the WMS 1.3.0 regarding 
Fees, AccessContraints. Further, it restricts the HTTP protocol to scheme http; and does 
not allow the scheme https.  

When describing the actual service endpoints, the structure looks different and there is 
the ability to use elements named ows:Constraint. The definition is this: 

<complexType name="RequestMethodType"> 
    <annotation> 
        <documentation>Connect point URL and any constraints for this HTTP request method 
for this operation request. In the OnlineResourceType, the xlink:href attribute in the 
xlink:simpleAttrs attribute group shall be used to contain this URL. The other attributes 
in the xlink:simpleAttrs attribute group should not be used. </documentation> 
    </annotation> 
    <complexContent> 
        <extension base="ows:OnlineResourceType"> 
            <sequence> 
                <element name="Constraint" type="ows:DomainType" minOccurs="0" 
maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
                    <annotation> 
                        <documentation>Optional unordered list of valid domain 
constraints on non-parameter quantities that each apply to this request method for this 
operation. If one of these Constraint elements has the same "name" attribute as a 
Constraint element in the OperationsMetadata or Operation element, this Constraint 
element shall override the other one for this operation. The list of required and 
optional constraints for this request method for this operation shall be specified in the 
Implementation Specification for this service. </documentation> 
                    </annotation> 
                </element> 
            </sequence> 
        </extension> 
    </complexContent> 
</complexType>

OGC 15-022 

42 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

  
Even though it is difficult to understand the proper use of the Constraint element, note 
that a definition exists and is from OWS 1.1.0 schema: owsOperationsMetadata.xsd 

However, the WMTS Capabilities document introduces two new features: (i) reference a 
WSDL document and (ii) reference ISO metadata document: 

<element name="WSDL" type="ows:OnlineResourceType" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
    <annotation> 
        <documentation>Reference to a WSDL resource</documentation> 
    </annotation> 
</element> 
<element name="ServiceMetadataURL" type="ows:OnlineResourceType" minOccurs="0" 
maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
    <annotation> 
        <documentation> 
            Reference to a ServiceMetadata resource on resource  
            oriented architectural style 
        </documentation> 
    </annotation> 
</element> 

       
One side note on the complexity of the WMTS Capabilities schemas: There is a 
requirement for a number of individual schema files to work together, to be loaded, to 
validated, and as a result generate the correct Capabilities document.  

One conclusion is that the WMTS Capabilities document may not contain a vendor 
specific part (or simply an extension) as was possible for the WMS 1.1.1 and WMS 1.3. 

7.2.4.4 WFS 1.1.0 

The WFS 1.1.0 implementation specification uses a normative reference to OWS 
Common 0.3.0 but the WFS Schema (http://schemas.opengis.net/wfs/1.1.0/wfs.xsd) 
includes the OWS Common 1.0.0 schema. This includes the OWS 
owsOperationsMetadata.xsd as of version 1.0.0.2. Please note that this version already 
introduces the option for ows:Constraint as explained in the next chapter. 

7.2.4.5 WFS 2.0, WCS 2.0, SOS 2.0, SPS 2.0 

The Capabilities document for the WCS 2.0 is based on a schema that includes OWS 
Common v 2.0. The other service Capabilities documents include the OWS Common 
1.1.0 schema. Because OWS Common 1.1.0 and 2.0 provide the ows:Constraint, it is 
possible to use that element for each operation. Therefore, this seems to be the correct 
existing hook for including security description towards Common Security. 

The following annotation of an existing WFS 2.0 Capabilities document illustrates an 
example approach for describing Common Security regarding Authentication and Access 
Control. The original part is shaded 10% grey.

    </ows:Constraint> 

</ows:Operation> 

 

7.2.4.6 CSW 2.0.2 

The Capabilities document for the CSW 2.0.2 is based on a schema that includes OWS 
Common v 1.0. Regarding the option to describe ows:Constraint for each operation, this 
is possible as for the OWS Common 1.0 schema. 

7.2.5 Implications to existing approaches to secure OGC Service instances 

After the study of the OGC Web Services standards and their common base OWS 
Common, apparently there is no standardized support to host an OGC Web Service 
instance over HTTPS and by that to implement the Confidentiality and Integrity 
frameworks. To the editor’s understanding, the use of HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) would 
require a normative reference to RFC 2818. 

 Also, the approach for implementing the Authentication Framework via HTTP 
Authentication seem to be invalid, because all service requests require that the HTTP 
Authorization Header element is present or the service responds with an invalid HTTP 
status code. To the editors understanding, the use of HTTP Authentication that enables 
the use of HTTP status code 401 requires a normative reverence to RFC 2617. 



OGC 15-022 

44 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

In addition to the above, putting a complete service instance (including all operations) 
behind HTTP Authentication has the implication that it breaks the OGC Find / Bind 
mechanics. As explained in an earlier section of this ER, common practice for a client is 
to connect to a service using the GetCapabilities operations. So in a case where the entire 
service and all operations are locked, it is not possible to base a description of Common 
Security inside the Capabilities document. In order to overcome this, an implementation 
can host the Capabilities as a publicly accessible XML instance document. In other 
words, the Find / Bind must be based on a publically accessible Capabilities document. 

7.3 OWS Operations Metadata 

All OGC Web Services except WMS 1.x and 1.3 include the ability to describe the 
Operations Metadata in a Capabilities document. The schema to describe the operations 
metadata is inside the file “owsOperationsMetadta.xsd” which does exist on the OGC 
Schema Web Server (http://schemas.opengis.net) as local copies in each directory for 
OWS: 

Table 6 — OWS Operations Metadata Schema files 

OWS Common 1.0 http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/1.0.0/owsOperationsMetadata.xsd  

OWS Common 1.1.0 http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/1.1.0/owsOperationsMetadata.xsd  

OWS Common 2.0 http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/2.0/owsOperationsMetadata.xsd  

 

At first sight, all files have a different data and different size. The important aspect is that 
all version have the same identical definition for ows:Constraint: 

<element name="Constraint" 
    type="ows:DomainType" 
    minOccurs="0" 
    maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
    <annotation> 
        <documentation>Optional unordered list of valid domain constraints 
            on non-parameter quantities that each apply to this server. The 
            list of required and optional constraints shall be specified in 
            the Implementation Specification for this service.</documentation> 
    </annotation> 
</element> 

 

It is also very important that all version of OWS Operations Metadata define the concept 
of extended Capabilities that basically introduces the option of inserting XML elements 
using XSD anyType: 

<element name="ExtendedCapabilities" 
    type="anyType"> 
    <annotation> 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 45 
 

        <documentation>Individual software vendors and servers can use this 
            element to provide metadata about any additional server 
            abilities.</documentation> 
    </annotation> 
</element> 

 

  

8 Missing standards to enable Common Security and implications of their use 

As outlined before, there are two typical approaches feasible when implementing 
common security: (i) The first approach can be based on all tools that the communication 
layer (HTTP) does provide; (ii) The second approach can be based on message security 
leveraging SOAP + WS-*. 

The following two sub-sections outline which common (main stream) IT standards from 
other standardization organizations must be normatively referenced from OGC Web 
Services to enable either approach. 

8.1 Implementation of the Common Security based on HTTP 

If the implementation of the introduced frameworks as Common Security be applied 
leveraging HTTP specific options only, then should the following list of standards be 
normatively referenced from an OGC Web Service standard and adoptions in the OGC 
standards text be applied? The following are specific recommendations. 

8.1.1 HTTP/1.1 (IETF RFC 2616) 

The communication base is HTTP version 1.1. A OGC Web Service implementation or 
the hosting Web Server shall support all HTTP verbs and not limit the communication to 
GET and POST, even though these are the potentially the most dominantly used verbs. 

The reporting of exception codes shall take place with precedence for HTTP if 
communication protocol related. The exception codes listed in OGC Web Service 
standards, which by majority are related to geospatial, shall be used in all other cases. 
However, for REST or RESTful implementations, the XML based exception codes 
should become available as OGC specific HTTP status codes. 

8.1.2 HTTP Authentication (IETF RFC 2617) 

For support in implementing the Authentication Framework with support of the HTTP 
communication protocol using Basic and Digest, RFC 2617 shall be normatively 
referenced from all OGC Web Services standards. 

To enable more sophisticated authentication options such as OAuth2 and SAML, other 
appropriate standards shall be normatively referenced. So for support of OAuth2 Bearer 



OGC 15-022 

46 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Tokens, RFC 6749 and in particular the use of Authorization Bearer shall be permitted. 
For supporting the SAML based (federated) authentication, no authentication specific 
requirements exist for the service implementation. However, implications exist for the 
implementation of a (desktop) client.  

It should be pointed out that the use of HTTP Authentication is only recommended if 
HTTP over TLS is enabled.  

8.1.3 HTTP + TLS (IETF RFC 2818) 

Implementation of the Confidentiality and/or Integrity framework(s) via HTTP over TLS 
or better HTTPS require that OGC Web Service standards normatively reference RFC 
2818. The proper rollout does imply that additional standards and practices are in place to 
ensure proper Public Key management (PKI), but the details for that are out of scope for 
this ER, as no implications exist to the OGC standardization. However, it is important to 
ensure that implementations leverage the CRL mechanism and verify root certificates on 
SSL certificates properly. Trusting all certificates is not good and in particular not a 
secure practice. At least timestamp and hostname vs. certificate common name checks 
should be implemented. 

It should be mandated for an OGC Web Service Instance that has implemented Common 
Security that the only communication scheme is HTTPS; any HTTP based communi-
cation shall be disallowed.  

8.1.4 HTTP Cookies (IETF RFC 2965) 

Even though the general state of an OGC Web Service shall be stateless, one common 
practice is to reference to a security session via HTTP cookies. In particular for high 
performance solutions, the storage of pointers to a common security context using 
cookies is an acceptable practice. In order to enable to maintain a communication and 
security state for a particular client / service interaction, the normative reference of RFC 
2965 for all OGC Web Service standards is required. 

HTTP Cookies are a particular kind of HTTP header and therefore available for HTTP 
and HTTP over TLS (HTTPS). In order to ensure that Cookies can only be used for 
HTTP, they should be tagged for “http” use. In case a Cookie shall be used for HTTPS 
connections only, it should be tagged “secure” in addition. 

Therefore, when implementing the Integrity / Confidentiality Framework, clearly state in 
the OGC Web Service standard that Cookies are to be tagged for “http”, “secure” 
communications only and in addition be linked with the most exclusive path and are 
properly time constrained.  

The use of persistent Cookies should be prevented, unless they do not introduce a 
security risk. For example, in the context of an Access Management Federation, a 
persistent cookie may be used to persistently store the choice of the login entity. The 



OGC 15-022 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 47 
 

choice of entity does not introduce a security risk, as the actual login credentials – of 
course – are never stored in any Cookie. 

8.2 Implementation of the Common Security based on SOAP 

Implementation of the outlined frameworks using SOAP comes with the interoperability 
limitations as outlined earlier in section 4.4.3.3. However, the use of SOAP (XML) 
encoded requests introduces the option to leverage WS-Security and related standards to 
build your own interoperability stack for the Integrity, Confidentiality and Authentication 
frameworks independent from the communication layer: HTTP. However, the use of 
HTTP+TLS can be seen as an optional improvement. 

In order to support the use of WS-* based implementation of Common Security, the OGC 
Web Service standards must normatively reference the appropriate suite of Web Security 
standards. Detailing which standards these are in detail is outside the scope of this ER. 
However, this ER includes the relevant standards in the Reference section and a basic 
view of the WS-* family standards are given in figure 4. A comprehensive introduction 
that may help to conclude is available in [1]. 

Note that the use of WS-Security applies encryption to XML and therefore, the W3C 
standards XML Digital Signatures and XML Encryption are also mandatory. In addition, 
good practice is to remind implementers that the use of XML Signature introduces many 
pitfalls like XML canonicalization and digital signatures on external transformations that 
may result in applying integrity to any content. Therefore, we recommend considering the 
W3C Best Practices on how to use XML Digital Signatures (see [23] for details). 

8.3 Implementation of the Common Security on the client side 

When introducing the options for implementing Common Security on the service side, 
the standardization must pick-up on the client side as well and give normative guidance 
what to implement, how to process requests and responses and in particular how to act on 
exceptions. 

Since OWS Common does not reference any security related standards creates a huge 
disadvantage, as most clients for OGC Web Services do not or only partly support the 
implementation of the different security frameworks as Common Security. This limitation 
is very important, as on the server side security enabled proxies can be deployed to add 
Common Security.  

In order to outline relevant requirements and standards to implement Common Security 
on clients that are able to interact with secured OGC Web Services, consider 
functionalities common to main stream IT clients. For a better classification of client 
types, this ER separates applications that are executed in a Web Browser (Web Browser 
applications) and applications that are executed on the OS (desktop clients).

8.4 Support for Common Security in (typical modern) Web Browser based applications 

Obviously, a Web Browser application is able to leverage general and in particular 
security related functions provided by the executing container; the Browser. In addition, 
the execution inside a Browser introduces limitations caused by the security sandboxing 
to prevent content injection attacks leveraging cross-site scripting. Even though it is 
outside the scope of this ER to go into details, two dominant limitations exist: (i) Same 
Origin (JavaScript related functions are limited to call content from “same” domains) and 
(ii) Mixed-content is either blocked or flagged in the browser (application that was 
loaded via HTTP uses content loaded over HTTP). The implementation has to overcome 
these (and other) Browser constraints. There is no explicit guidance or standardization 
required from OGC. 

Modern Web Bowser usually support HTTP (RFC 2616), HTTP over TLS (RFC 2818), 
HTTP Authentication (RFC 2617) and HTTP Cookies (RFC 2965) which already enables 
to implement Common Security based on HTTP as outlined in sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2. 

Important is also the built-in support of general processing functions that are simply 
available when implementing a client application to run as a Browser app:  

1) JavaScript provides a wide spectrum of important processing functions. 

2) Processing of (X)HTML content with support for automatic handling if JavaScript 
is enabled 

3) Processing of HTTP status codes and HTTP Cookies 

4) Validation of SSL/TLS certificate when using HTTP+TLS connections, with the 
option of checking CRLs 

5) Support for mine/type specific execution of external applications 

Observing the general functions of a Web Browser unveils that XML processing support 
is not available.  

8.5 Support for Common Security in desktop Applications 

In contrast to web applications that run inside a Web Browser, a desktop application is 
executed on the Operating System. This implies that there is no pre-existing skeleton of 
communication and processing functions to leverage. Any function must be integrated by 
importing the right library. Further, the proper use of the library must be enabled. One 
non-trivial example among many is the proper validation of HTTPS connections with 
support of HTTP cookies over HTTP redirects. 

Therefore, logically OGC standardization should mandate a particular set of HTTP 
communication: general and security specific IT functions that are to be implemented 



OGC 15-022

with a client that is capable to interact with an OGC Web Service that offers Common 
Security. Contrary to applications that run inside a Web Browser, the extensive 
processing of XML is usually part of desktop applications. In that sense, it seems 
reasonable to believe that these clients should be able to support Common Security 
implemented using SOAP + WS-*. 

Desktop applications should be able to support different implementations of the 
Authentication framework. In particular, an implementation shall support RFC 2617 
(HTTP Authentication), RFC 6749 (OAuth2 Tokens), RFC 5246 (TLS mutual) and 
SAML ECP. The support for SAML as a federated authentication solution is (according 
to the Gardner Group) gaining momentum for enterprises to interconnect, independent 
from security domains. Some requirements: 

 Validation of SSL/TLS certificates is required. 

 Support HTTP Cookies (RFC 2965) to maintain a security context across requests 
is required.  

 Desktop client use of HTTP status codes and processes OGC specific XML 
encoded exceptions is required. The latter can usually be limited to display the 
content of the exception to the user rather than programmatic actions. 

9 Conclusion, Recommendations to OGC standardization and future work 

9.1 Conclusion 

The conclusion: Can a method for Common Security for OGC standards be defined? A 
definition is not possible within the current suite of OGC Standards. 

The main reason is the lack of an OGC common security model that can be implemented 
by OGC Web Services. The most dominant example is the limitation to use HTTP as 
constrained by all OWS Common versions schemas (operationsMetadata.xsd) that 
prevents service operations implementing HTTP over TLS to address the integrity and 
confidentiality frameworks: 

OWS Version 1.0: http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/1.0.0/owsOperationsMetadata.xsd  

OWS Version 1.1.0: http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/1.1.0/owsOperationsMetadata.xsd  

OWS Version 2.0:  http://schemas.opengis.net/ows/2.0/owsOperationsMetadata.xsd

9.2 Recommendations for OGC Standardization 

This chapter outlines a few short recommendations to address the “missing bits” required 
to enable security. Please read the entire Engineering Report to find all 
recommendations12. 

9.2.1 Define a common security architecture 

In order to guarantee interoperability for OGC Web Services that have implemented one 
or multiple of the outlined security frameworks (protected services), the OGC members 
need to define a Common Security Architecture for OGC Web Services and Clients. This 
could be achieved by establishing a Web Services Security SWG which charter to include 
to define a Common Security Capabilities extension, WSDL documents including 
guidance how to embed WS-* and WS-Policy when using SOAP as well as defining a 
common approach to the OGC Publish / Find / Bind paradigm for protected services. 

The crafting of that charter could be take place within the realm of the OGC Security 
Working Group, perhaps in liaison with the OGC Architecture DWG.  

9.2.2 All OGC Web Services standards to include Security considerations 

For each OGC Web Service standard that endorses the use of security by including 
security standards related normative references as outlined before, each and every 
standard shall contain a section on security considerations. This section shall outline 
security implications based on the data and processing model and in particular on the 
operations of the service.  

The implications should consider that implementation of all the introduced ISO 
frameworks are required. Therefore, the implications towards the implementation of the 
authentication, access control, confidentiality, and integrity but in particular the non-
repudiation framework shall be included. 

                                                

12 The editor decided not to copy and paste all recommendation into one single section as it would mean to separate the 
recommendation from the meaningful context.

9.2.3 Define and Describe Common Security in Capabilities document 

The description for the implementation of the security frameworks, as part of the 
Common Security, should be in the Capabilities document. In particular, ows:Constraint 
shall be included for each operation.  

<ows:Constraint name="authentication"> 
  <ows:AllowedValues> 
    <ows:Value>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:SSO:browser</ows:Value> 
    <ows:Value>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:SSO:ecp</ows:Value> 
    </ows:AllowedValues> 
  <ows:Metadata 
xlink:href="http://www.unibw.de/.../inspire/authCodelists.xml#AuthenticationCode"/>  
</ows:Constraint> 

 

9.2.4 GetCapabilities operation 

In order to provide the common hook ows:Constraint for describing common security 
constraints on service operations, either: 

 the GetCapabilities operation is publically accessible and not protected, or 

 a publically accessible Capabilities instance document is hosted on a web server 
that contains the <Operations> section including the security description. 

In the case where the served content is classified, the full list of data offerings is only 
returned if the user issues the GetCapabilties request as a recognized user. This implies 
the use of the publically assessable Capabilities instance document that does not contain 
the classified data offerings but outline the GetCapabilities operation as protected. This 
ensures that the data offerings are not published to anonymous users, but authorized users 
can bind to the service by following the protected GetCapabilities operation. 

Table 7 — Example Capabilities document with no data offerings  
<ows:OperationsMetadata> 
    <ows:Operation name="GetCapabilities"> 
        <ows:DCP> 
            <ows:HTTP> 
                <ows:Get xlink:href="http://maps.dgs.udel.edu:80/geoserver/dgs/wfs"/> 
                <ows:Post xlink:href="http://maps.dgs.udel.edu:80/geoserver/dgs/wfs"/> 
            </ows:HTTP> 
        </ows:DCP> 
        <ows:Parameter name="AcceptVersions"> 
            <ows:AllowedValues> 
                <ows:Value>1.0.0</ows:Value> 
                <ows:Value>1.1.0</ows:Value> 
                <ows:Value>2.0.0</ows:Value> 
            </ows:AllowedValues> 
        </ows:Parameter> 
        <ows:Parameter name="AcceptFormats"> 
            <ows:AllowedValues> 
                <ows:Value>text/xml</ows:Value> 
            </ows:AllowedValues> 
        </ows:Parameter> 
        <ows:Constraint name="authentication"> 



OGC 15-022

            <ows:AllowedValues> 
                <ows:Value>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:SSO:browser</ows:Value> 
                <ows:Value>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:profiles:SSO:ecp</ows:Value> 
            </ows:AllowedValues> 
            <ows:Metadata 
xlink:href="http://www.unibw.de/.../authCodelists.xml#AuthenticationCode"/>  
        </ows:Constraint> 
        <ows:Constraint name="access"> 
            <ows:AllowedValues> 
                <ows:Value>urn:tbd:policy:GetFeature</ows:Value> 
            </ows:AllowedValues> 
            <ows:Metadata 
xlink:href="http://www.unibw.de/.../accessCodelists.xml#AccessCode"/>  
        </ows:Constraint> 
    </ows:Operation> 
</ows:OperationsMetadata> 
<!-- 
    <FeatureTypeList/> 
--> 
<fes:Filter_Capabilities> 
    ... 
</fes:Filter_Capabilities> 

 

The example Capabilities instance is valid even though the <FeatureTypeList> element is 
missing. 

9.2.5 OWS Common limitations on DCP element 

For future versions of the common schema, 

 Relax the option to use protocol scheme HTTPS of a service operation 
description. 

 Provide guidance when to outline support for the HTTP GET and POST method 
in a capabilities document, referring to the same operation. As an example, it 
would be perfectly OK to allow for GetCapabilities just HTTP GET and for 
GetFeature only HTTP POST, because the security framework is only available 
for POST but not for GET. Disallow a service to jump from one protocol verb to 
another for the same operation once a session is established to relax the 
implementation of a or more security frameworks.  

9.2.6 WMS 

The 1.3.0 version of the WMS does not support the use of ows:Constraint as it does not 
reference the OWS Common schema. Therefore, adopt the WMS Capabilities DTD for a 
WMS 1.3 upon next revision to allow the use of ows:Constraint as in the other OGC Web 
Services. 

For the WMS 2.0 standardization, make sure WMS 2.0 leverages the OWS Common 
schema to maintain continuity in the use of ows:Constraint.

9.2.7 Use of common IT security standards 

OGC Web Service standards shall normatively reference mainstream IT standards on 
security that are required to implement the ISO frameworks listed above. 

9.2.8 Client side standardization 

OGC must also specify how a client implementation shall work. In particular that it 
implements the main stream IT security related standards as outlined in section 8. 

9.3 Future work 

The following are draft examples into the definition of a description for Common 
Security to all OGC Web Services. However, as this report focuses on the general options 
how to base descriptions, the following examples must be considered rudimentary.  

9.3.1 Define and Describe Common Security in Capabilities document 

Based on the recommendation to integrate a description to Common Security inside the 
operation metadata of a Capabilities document, the details and semantics must be defined.  
In particular, the available names for ows:Constraint shall be defined. The following 
names may be used as an indication towards the meaning of a constraint to be indicator 
for an implementation of a particular framework: 

Table 8 — Framework implementation key examples 

ISO Security Framework Constraint Name 

Authentication urn:ogc:def:security:authentication 

Access Control urn:ogc:def:security:access 

Integrity urn:ogc:def:security:https 

urn:ogc:def:security:ws-security 

Confidentiality urn:ogc:def:security:https 

urn:ogc:def:security:ws-security 

 

The actual values of the constraint identifiers are defined in the actual ISO compliant 
code list that is referenced via the ows:Metadata element. In that sense, the 
ows:AllowedValues are non OGC URNs. They relate to other standardization 
organizations identifiers and relate to their standardization. The above example 
references a code list that defines two profiles of OASIS SAML for authentication.

9.3.2 Expressiveness of the Capabilities document to define Common Security 

As illustrated above, different OGC Web Services are based on different versions of 
OWS Common. From the perspective to find a common ground how to express Common 
Security constraints in the OGC Capabilities document, unfortunately WMS 1.1.1 and 
WMS 1.3 Capabilities are not based on an OWS Common schema. 

It is recommended that WMS 2.0, as currently work in progress, shall provide the ability 
to use the same definition for OperationsMetadata as defined in OWS Common 1.0, 1.1.0 
and 2.0. This would ensure that for WMS 2.0 the same description mechanism could be 
used. 

It is also recommended that guidance be created how to use the ows:Constraint element 
in the Operations Metadata regarding the description of the Common Security. Perhaps 
the guidance is to not use this element to express the existence of security framework 
implementations but the capabilities extension mechanism instead. 

9.3.3 Define a Codelist for supported Authentication options 

In order to guarantee interoperability with authentication, it is recommended to 
standardize the allowed methods. So basically, define the OGC code list for supported 
authentication methods. 

9.3.4 Define a GeoXACML or XACML policy based codelist for Authorizaiton 

The codelist for authorization should outline access rights (or constraints) using a 
standards based description. It is recommended to base the description on the OASIS 
XACML or OGC GeoXACML standards.
