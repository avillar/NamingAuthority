	Appendix A: Revision History







Abstract

Testbed 12 work has resulted in Change Requests (CRs) to the GeoPackage Encoding Standard. CRs have been submitted to the GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) as GitHub issues. This engineering report (ER) summarizes the results of these activities.




Business Value

This ER shows how the OGC Testbed process furthers the SWG process.




What does this ER mean for the Working Group and OGC in general

OGC Testbeds are an opportunity to evaluate and assess the most problematic parts of the OGC standards baseline. Realistic experiments are often the best way to resolve issues that arise.




How does this ER relate to the work of the Working Group

This ER documents the direct impact that Testbed 12 has had on the SWG work.

4.1. Multi-resolution Vector Data


Reference: GitHub




Vector data is regularly rendered onto a map view. The density of the feature data that can reasonably rendered on a particular map depends on the map’s scale. To support multiple map scales, providers regularly produce multiple versions of the vector geometries.




4.1.1. Status Quo


During previous GeoPackage discussions, a consensus was reached that there should only be a single geometry column in each feature table. The consequence of this decision is that the only way to support multiple geometries for each feature type is to have multiple tables and/or views. However, there is currently no standard way to do this.






4.1.2. Alternatives Considered


	
Create a set of geometry tables, one for each scale range. (The original design duplicated the attributes as well, but the consensus was that this was wasteful and to use joins to avoid the duplication.) Create a metadata table that links scales to the geometry tables. Client applications then read from the appropriate geometry table.


	
Create an ancillary geometry table for each feature table. For each feature, create a set of generalized geometries and store in the table the recommended scale denominators for each. Scale ranges may be generated based on visualization requirements. If a generalized geometry differs very little from scale range to scale range, scale ranges can safely be merged to avoid duplication. Client applications then read from the appropriate geometry table.









4.1.3. Recommended Approach


The recommended approach is #2.




There is a benefit to not having fixed scale ranges. For mobile, fixed scale ranges do not necessarily render ideally. This also prevents duplicating generalized geometries that are appropriate for multiple scales.




However, it was determined that it would be premature to encode this into the standard at this time. We recommend researching this topic in Testbed 13 or in a separate interoperability experiment.

4.2. Non-spatial Tables


References: GitHub, Change Request




A strict reading of the GeoPackage specification does not allow non-spatial attribute tables.
Data providers need to deliver attribute tables that do not contain geometry properties.
For example, a GeoPackage containing real-estate or parcel management data would need to contain:




	
a tiled image of the subject area


	
a feature table of the parcel boundaries (properties such as parcel ID, parcel geometry, area, etc.)


	
a non-spatial attribute table defining property ownership
(properties such as parcel ID, purchase date, sale date, owner, etc.)







Based on the existing standard, the non-spatial table cannot be included unless you define the GeoPackage as an "Extended GeoPackage".




Requiring any GeoPackage that contains non-spatial tables to be declared as an "Extended GeoPackage" is not reasonable and does not promote interoperability.




4.2.1. Alternatives Considered


Approach #1: Creating an extension that would make these tables discoverable. A simple extension such as the following would support this:



	gpkg_extensions column	value
	table_name
	Actual table name

	column_name
	NULL

	extension_name
	gpkg_non_spatial

	defintion
	TBD

	scope
	read-write




Approach #2: Redefining the definition of "Extended GeoPackage" and adding a section to the core specification allowing non-spatial attribute tables in a basic GeoPackage would eliminate the problem. This requires some relatively minor updates to sections 1 and 2 and does not introduce any obvious backwards compatibility issues.






4.2.2. Recommendation


We recommend Approach #2.






4.2.3. SWG Response


Approach #2 was adopted by the SWG at the September TC.








4.3. Deprecating Requirement #69


References: GitHub, Change Request




4.3.1. Recommendation


It is difficult, if not impossible, to comply with Requirement 69 "SQL functions that operate on GeoPackageBinary geometries as specified in other extensions SHALL operate correctly on the non-linear geometries specified in this extension." because the functions could have been loaded via an extension such SpatiaLite which cannot be changed, and does not support the non-linear geometries.






4.3.2. SWG Response


The SWG voted to deprecate this requirement.  The removal of this requirement will allow for interoperable storage and retrieval of the geometries, while not requiring but allowing existing functions to work with the geometries.








4.4. Deprecating non-Interoperable Extensions


References: GitHub, Change Request




The “User Defined Geometry Types Extension of GeoPackageBinary Geometry Encoding” extension was determined to have the following issues:




	
The geometry encoding is not specified in the extension and therefore a supplemental document explaining the encoding would be required. In the absence of this document, there is no way for an application developer to support this extension and therefore it is not interoperable.


	
Multiple developers could implement the encoding of a new, but similar geometry type such as EllipiticalCurve in different ways.


	
Existing spatial functions will not work with the new geometry types and could potentially cause errors or skip data if used.







4.4.1. SWG Response


The GeoPackage SWG voted to remove this extension for the reasons above.




The SWG also voted to remove two addition extensions, “Geometry Type Triggers” and “Geometry SRS ID Triggers”, from the encoding standard as they directly relate to User-Defined Geometry Types Extension and will no longer be required.






4.4.2. Future Work


The SWG believes that content contained in these extensions would be better suited in a best practice document. This document could outline how to create a complete and interoperable User Defined Geometry Type Extension, including the details of the geometry encoding and how it can be used with existing spatial functions. This would allow two independent developers to create User-Defined Geometry Type extensions that follow the same template and make it easier for clients of the extensions to adopt.








4.5. Column Name for WKT for Coordinate Reference Systems


References: GitHub, Change Request




4.5.1. Recommendation


The “WKT for Coordinate Reference Systems” extension was designed to align to a new OGC Encoding Standard, OGC 12-063r5. The text in GPKG 1.1 (including the column name) incorrectly references “12-163” instead. We recommend updating the reference to the proper value.






4.5.2. SWG Response


The SWG voted to correct the column name. This change corrects all references to the proper “12-063”. The GeoPackage SWG regrets the error. This change is considered to be low-risk. At worst, implementers may need to populate a redundant column to satisfy clients that use this extension but only support GPKG 1.1.








4.6. Remove .gpkx Option


References: GitHub, Change Request




4.6.1. Recommendation


The OGC GeoPackage specification outlines in great detail the extension mechanism. In order for an application to determine what extensions are currently available, it must open the GeoPackage and query the gpkg_extensions table. It is likely that an application that supports no extensions can still access the GeoPackage without issue, especially if the application accesses a GeoPackage in a read-only fashion and the gpkg_extensions.scope column indicates a value of “write_only”. The presence of the ".gpkx" extension provides no real value. Applications still need to open the GeoPackage to determine if the extensions impose any additional requirements on accessing the data and therefore the ".gpkx" extension serves no purpose.




Applications will need to recognize two separate file extensions. There is a distinct possibility that application developers will only support the mandatory ".gpkg" file extension.






4.6.2. SWG Response


The SWG determined that this option served no discernible purpose and therefore voted to eliminate it and strikethrough the text in the standard.








4.7. Remove Minimal Set of Rows from gpkg_spatial_ref_sys


References: GitHub, Change Request




4.7.1. Recommendation


Requirement 11 in the GeoPackage specification provides a minimal listing of rows that shall be contained in the gpkg_spatial_ref_sys table. These rows may not be necessary for the content of the GeoPackage and should not be required. They cause issues for possible profiles of the GeoPackage specification because these profiles may restrict the allowed CRSs, this restriction may not include EPSG:4326. Furthermore, since the allowed CRSs are defined, the value of srs_id of -1 for undefined Cartesian coordinate reference systems and the srs_id of 0 for undefined geographic coordinate reference systems will never be required. It is our recommendation to update this requirement so that the gpkg_spatial_ref_sys table MAY contain these entries.






4.7.2. SWG Response


As of the time of publication, this was still an open issue.








4.8. Clarification of Acceptable Extensions


References: GitHub, Change Request, Change Request.




4.8.1. Recommendation


We recommend that the current GeoPackage 1.1 tables be evaluated and that additional requirements be added stating (as appropriate) that semantics are immutable for specific tables and as such cannot be changed via a profile or extension.






4.8.2. SWG Response


The SWG has had an informal policy position that the definition and semantics of existing columns could not be changed. Therefore it updated Requirement 58 to clarify these rules.








4.9. Add Extension for Vector Tiles


References: GitHub, Change Request




While tiling and the use of multiple levels of details are a proven technique for raster data, it is relatively new for vector data, due to the increased complexity compared to raster tiling and lack of standardization on the topic.




4.9.1. Recommendation


We recommend that a future interoperability experiment or testbed evaluate this extension for interoperability. Once interoperability is proven, it should be considered as an addition to the GeoPackage Encoding Standard as an extension.






4.9.2. SWG Response


As of the time of publication, the SWG had not yet acted on this CR.








4.10. TIN Extension


References: GitHub, Change Request




The current GeoPackage standard is in need of a method for storing elevation data. We recommend a table for triangulated irregular networks (TIN) and an additional table for gridded elevation data.




4.10.1. Recommendation


We recommend that a future interoperability experiment or testbed propose an approach for implementing this capability then evaluating it for interoperability. Once interoperability is proven, it should be considered as an addition to the GeoPackage Encoding Standard as an extension.






4.10.2. SWG Response


As of the time of publication, the SWG had not yet acted on this CR.
