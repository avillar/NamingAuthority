Preface 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC®) conducted a study of geospatial fusion 

including: a review of existing standards regarding fusion; a survey of standards and 

implementations using a Request For Information (RFI); and development of a set of 

recommendations for future standards and integration of other standards.   

In the context of this OGC Engineering Report (ER), “Fusion is the act or process of 

combining two or more pieces of data or information regarding one or more entities in 

order to improve the capability for detection, identification, or characterization of that 

entity”. 

This scope and need for this study was based on requirements and contributions from 

several OGC Member organizations, including the National Geospatial-intelligence 

Agency (NGA), BAE Systems - C3I Systems, and Lockheed Martin. 

This study addressed many challenging issues with a potentially enormous scope.  

Responses to the RFI were a major contribution toward focusing the study on topics that 

can be feasibly deployed in a distributed environment with interoperability based on open 

standards.  OGC and the sponsors of the study are most grateful to the organizations that 

responded to the RFI – listed in Section 5.3.   

This ER includes discussions and recommendations for fusion standards in three 

categories: sensor fusion, object/feature fusion, and decision fusion. Elements of this 

study will be implemented through the OGC Web Services, Phase 7 (OWS-7) Testbed.

 Fusion Standards Study Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC Engineering Report (ER) provides discussions and recommendations for 

information fusion, with a focus on geospatial information.  In this ER, fusion is discussed 

in three categories: sensor fusion, object/feature fusion, and decision fusion.  

Recommendations in this ER will be considered in the planning of future activities 

including the OWS-7 Testbed. 

The OGC Interoperability Program utilizes a multi-step methodology in defining an 

interoperability initiative.  Part one of the methodology is Concept Development which 

may use an RFI to gain better understanding of the current state of a given technology 

thrust and discover stakeholder insights about the architecture(s) to be used in subsequent 

testbeds.  Subsequent steps of the methodology include development of recommendations 

from the concept development study. 

1.2 The Open Geospatial Consortium  

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international not for profit voluntary 

industry consensus standards organization that provides a forum and proven processes for 

the collaborative development of free and publicly available interface specifications (open 

standards).  These open standards enable easier access to and use of geospatial information 

and improved interoperability of geospatial technologies (across any device, platform, 

system, network or enterprise) to meet the needs of the global community.  OGC open 

standards have been implemented broadly in the marketplace and are helping to foster 

distributed and component technology solutions that geo-enable web, wireless, and location 

based services as well as broader government and business IT enterprises worldwide. 

To accomplish the mission of the Consortium, OGC conducts three programs: 

 OGC‟s Specification Program facilitates formal consensus-based committees, working 
groups and special interest groups that establish a forum for OGC‟s industry, 

academic/research and user community members to collaboratively identify, prioritize 

and advance solutions to meet standards needs of the global community.   

 OGC‟s Interoperability Program promotes rapid prototyping, testing and validation of 
emerging standards through fast paced testbeds, experiments, pilot initiatives and 

related feasibility studies.   

 OGC‟s Outreach and Community Adoption Program conducts programs (training, 
articles in publications, workshops, conferences, etc) to promote awareness and 

implementation of OGC standards across the global community.

5 Fusion Standards Study  

5.1 Objectives of the Study 

Fusion Standards Goal:  The fusion standards study goal is to define and develop fusion 

standards to give analysts an environment where they can use interoperable tools to 

analyze, process and exploit two or more different types of data or products from the same 

or multiple sensors and databases from one client. 

Fusion Portfolio Objectives:  Developing new or exploiting current capabilities for fusing 

information from multiple sensors, from multiple sources, and from multiple INTs in ways 

that dramatically improve the ability to detect, identify, locate, and track objects. Research 

addresses fusing information from different sensors of the same modality, fusing 

information from IMINT sensors of different modalities (e.g. fusing LIDAR, hyperspectral, 

and OPIR), fusing information from different INTs (e.g. fusing IMINT and SIGINT), 

fusing disparate GEOINT data types, developing new ways to reason and make decisions 

from fused information, and providing fusion-based solutions to hard problems in a net-

centric environment. The research also addresses measurements and databases for fused 

and composite signatures of targets of interest, conflation of multi-sensor, multi-modality 

data, and development of automated fusion exploitation algorithms for hard problems. 

5.2 Standards Based Fusion  

Much of the fusion processes described in this Engineering Report can be achieved in 

multiple closed architectures with existing single provider software and hardware solutions.  

Fusion is not a new topic.   The problem addressed by this Engineering Report is to move 

those capabilities into an distributed architecture based upon open standards including 

standards for security, authorization, and rights management. 

State A (As-Is): Lack of identified and adopted standards results in multiple islands 

of data and stovepipe applications and services that are difficult to automate and 

scale for large data volumes and challenging analytical problems. 

State B (Target): Standards-based data, applications and services enable an 

automated and interoperable fusion environment supporting secure sharing of data 

and transparent reuse of “pluggable” services for handling large data volumes and 

unanticipated analytical challenges. 

5.3 Request for Information 

OGC issued a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit industry input into the Fusion 

Standards Study.  The RFI served as an element of a market survey of the current state of 

standards and implementations (commercial and open source) to determine the as-is level 

of support for standards based geospatial fusion with specific interest in fusion of multi-

INT sources in a net-centric environment. This market survey identified the level of 

maturity of identified standards and implementations to include any previous testing of 

these standards and services which may have occurred as part of the OGC interoperability 

program such as testbeds, interoperability experiments, etc.

6 Definition and Categories of Fusion 

6.1 Definition of Fusion 

The initial working definition used in this study was “Fusion is the act or process of 

combining two or more pieces of data or information regarding one or more entities in 

order to improve one‟s capability (or provide a new capability) for detection, identification, 

or characterization of that entity”.  

In addition to the initial working definition, the sponsors of the study also pointed out that 

according to the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL), data fusion is “A process dealing 

with the association, correlation, and combination of data and information from single and 

multiple sources to achieve: 

 Refined position and identify estimates, and  

 Complete and timely assessments of situation and threats, and their significance” 

Several Fusion Study RFI responses commented on the definition of fusion: 

Fraunhofer defines fusion as “the processing of sensor data together with general 

knowledge of the phenomenon of interest.”  This definition is in the context of the Bayesian 

Maximum Entropy method.  It is recommended the inclusion of “general knowledge” or 

“knowledge framework” be used to modify the initial definition of fusion.  

Galdos commented “Fusion from our perspective is the creation of a collection of named 

and possibly typed associations between instances of typically disparate data types.”  It is 

recommended that the initial definition of fusion be modified to not require “combining” 

but simply “association” of the source data.  

PYXIS adopts a strong requirement that “Network-centric fusion requires that information 

is pre-aligned to a uniform model (or can be rapidly aligned) so that all data sets are self 

synchronized.”  A requirement for alignment and self-synchronization is too strong; 

whereas the ability to relate data based upon harmonized knowledge framework is offered 

as a less restrictive approach. 

 

Based on the RFI Responses, this definition is derived from the initial working definition: 

“Fusion is the act or process of combining or associating data or information 

regarding one or more entities considered in an explicit or implicit knowledge 

framework to improve one’s capability (or provide a new capability) for detection, 

identification, or characterization of that entity”.

6.2 Categories of Fusion  

As indicated in the working definition of fusion listed above, fusion processes can apply to 

many types of entities.  Categories of fusion depend on the processing stage or semantic 

level at which fusion takes place. Fusion processes are often categorized as shown in Figure 

1.  Sensor Fusion combines several sources of raw data to produce new data that is 

expected to be more informative and synthetic than the inputs.  This kind of fusion requires 

a precise (pixel-level) registration of the available images, as well as perhaps 

synchronization of dynamic observations.  In the intermediate category - Object or Feature 

Fusion - attributes or elements of geographic features are combined into new features and 

that may then be used by further processes.  Creating associations between features that 

were not previously associated is also considered.  Decision Fusion supports near-real-time 

manipulation and sharing of massive amounts of increasingly complex information 

collected and fused from diverse data sources to support collaborative decision making. 

 

Figure 1 –Categories of Fusion 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 9 

 

 

This Engineering Report is organized around three categories of fusion that build upon the 

categories displayed in Figure 1.  The three categories are consistent with geographic 

information ranging from sensor measurements through feature operations to decision 

support1.  The terminology for geographic information standards differs from terminology 

used in the field of image understanding2.  A feature in the ISO 19100 series of standards is 

an "object" in image understanding terminology.  A geometric object identified in an image 

in the ISO 19100 series is a "feature" in image understanding terminology.  

The Galdos response to the RFI commented that “We believe that the distinctions drawn in 

the framework for the study, namely between Sensor, Feature and Decision Fusion are 

essentially correct, although we would change the first one to Observation Fusion, as term 

Observation as adopted by OGC includes sensor readings.”  As there was not consensus on 

this proposal and there is much mind share regarding the term “sensors,” the project 

retained “Sensor Fusion”. 

 

The three categories of Fusion used in this Engineering Report are: 

 Sensor Fusion: ranging from sensor measurements of various observable properties 
to well characterized observations including uncertainties.  Fusion processes 

involve merging of multiple sensor measurements of the same phenomena (i.e., 

events of feature of interest) into a combined observation; and analysis of the 

measurement signature. 

 Object/Feature Fusion: includes processing of observations into higher order 
semantic features and feature processing.  Object/feature fusion improves 

understanding of the operational situation and assessment of potential threats and 

impacts to identify, classify, associate and aggregate entities of interest.  

Object/feature fusion processes include generalization and conflation of features.   

 Decision Fusion: focuses on client environments for analysts and decision makers 
to visualize, analyze, and edit data into fusion products for an understanding of a 

situation in context. Decision fusion includes the ability to fuse derived data and 

information with processes, policies, and constraints. Collaboration with other 

analysts is done using social networking services and collaboration tools that are 

location enabled.  

These categories of fusion are useful but are not completely distinct.  Assigning a fusion 

process to a specific category is done as a convenience for explanation in this Engineering 

Report and should not be considered a normative classification scheme.

8 Sensor Fusion 

8.1 Definition and Objectives 

Sensor Fusion considers sensor measurements of various observable properties to well 

characterized observations including uncertainties.  Fusion processes involve merging of 

multiple sensor measurements of the same phenomena (i.e. events of feature of interest) 

into a combined observation; and analysis of the measurement signature. 

Sensor fusion concerns the acquisition and exploitation of multiple measurements for the 

purpose of: 

 Obtaining a higher-level or more accurate measurement 

 Recognizing objects and events of interest 

 Determining properties of particular objects or events 

Sensor fusion involves how measurements are made available to fusion processes and how 

the fusion processes make use of the observations to create semantically higher order 

entities, e.g., geospatial features.   

The basic requirements for sensor fusion include: 

 Discovery of sensor systems, observations, and observation processes that meet a 
user‟s immediate needs 

 Determination of a sensor‟s capabilities and quality of measurements 

 Access to sensor parameters that automatically allow software to process and geo-
locate observations 

 Retrieval of real-time or time-series observations in standard encodings including 
encoding the uncertainty of the measurement and parameters need to process the 

measurements. 

 Tasking of sensors to acquire observations of interest 

 Subscription to and publishing of alerts to be issued by sensors or sensor services 
based upon certain criteria  

 Entity identification, classification and association. 

 Enablement of fusion processing by providing access to processing engines and 
needed reference information (e.g. signatures and training data). 

The relationships between sensor observations, recognized objects, and the fusion processes 

are illustrated in Figure 2 while each part is discussed in more detail below.

Figure 3 – Sensor Fusion processes 

Sensors Observations.  Much information suitable for fusion begins with or is derived 

from observations by sensors or humans. This is particularly true for information that is 

highly dynamic in nature and of a timely nature. These observations, either raw or 

processed, can serve as input into fusion processes or they may be used to identify 

recognizable objects or features that are then treated as input into a fusion process, as 

illustrated in Figure 3.  Identification of objects from sensor observations typically relies on 

comparison of these observations against known signatures for select objects or on the use 

of various classification algorithms. Signatures can be sensor or signal-dependent, and may 

be based on geometry, electromagnetic response, or on the combination of properties 

measured by multiple sensor types. The results of sensor observations or object recognition 

can be streamed in real-time, published as alerts or reports, or distributed to archives. 

As an example of using sensor fusion to recognize objects from multiple raw observations, 

consider capabilities able to recognize a particular moving object on the ground using 

multiple frames from a UAV-borne video camera. The shape and size of this feature may 

be able to be derived from multiple frames of the video, as might its speed and direction. 

While its color could be derived from a color camera, its temperature might be derived 

from an infrared imager upon the UAV or other platform. If this vehicle passes near a 

cluster of unattended ground sensors (UGS), a seismic sensor could determine its weight as 

well as potentially other properties based on certain signatures. An acoustic sensor might be 

able to discern additional properties of the vehicle based on known acoustic signatures. All 

of these observations provide additional knowledge about the properties of the features that 

may aid in recognizing the object itself and perhaps its intended purpose. 

Objects for Fusion.  Objects that are suitable for fusion and for enhancing situation 

awareness can include those that are fairly persistent and exist in a geospatial feature 

database (e.g. streets, buildings, etc.), as well as those that are highly dynamic and sensed 

in real time by sensors and human observers. Examples of highly dynamic features include 

explosions, gunshots, the passing of a vehicle, the movement of persons or objects of 



OGC 09-138

interest, the opening of a door, or the placement of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), 

just to mention a few. 

As discussed above, sensor observations can assist in recognizing features/objects and 

discerning their properties. Feature and feature properties may be stored in geospatial 

databases but may also be streamed or published as reports in real time. Relationships 

between features or differences in features over time can be used within a fusion process to 

enhance situation awareness 

Fusion Processes.  Fusion processes might take as input sensor observations, recognized 

objects/features, or a combination of both. The results of the fusion process might 

themselves include identified features of interests and might again be streamed in real-time, 

published as alerts or reports, or distributed to archives. Additionally the fusion process 

might result in a need to discover and task additional sensor assets that can provide 

information needed to refine or provide additional situation awareness. 

Fusion processes can be viewed from many perspectives.  Data fusion processes can be 

classified according to the measureable characteristics: 

 Spatial, e.g.: 

o creating mosaics and tiles from multiple imagery 

o 3D geometric reconstruction of static objects from imagery taken from 
multiple directions 

o creating image composites (e.g. combining low-resolution color imagery 
with high-resolution panchromatic imagery) 

o recognition of objects based on texture (e.g. Fast-Fourier Transforms) or key 
spatial positions (e.g. facial recognition) 

 Spatial-temporal (temporal differencing),  e.g.: 

o determining paths of objects from video observations or other temporal 
observations 

o discovering long-term changes (e.g. new construction) 

o recognizing time-series patterns and subsequent anomalies, such as motion 
of crowds or traffic, or patterns in communication chatter 

 Spectral (all measureable electromagnetic wavelengths). e.g:   

o determining chemical composition from hyperspectral signatures 

o event or object recognition based on spectral signature 

o object recognition based on magnetic or gravitational disturbance or seismic 
signature  

o voice or sound recognition 

o determining speed and direction using Doppler shift 

 Disparate observable properties, e.g.: 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 15 

 

o deriving windchill from temperature and wind speed 

o determining vehicle type from acoustic and magnetic signals 

o determining a building‟s function from geometry and temperature 
measurements 

Additionally, fusion can be classified by the source of the information: 

 Multi-sensor, e.g.: 

o Same modality (e.g. video from different UAVs) 

o Different modality/multi signal (e.g. combining acoustic and seismic)  

 Multi-INT or multi-agency (e.g. MASINT combined with IMINT) 

 Multi-Object (e.g. an identified type of vehicle driven by a particular person) 

Regardless, the fusion process can result in reports of information regarding events or 

feature of interest. This information can be of various quality and with various levels of 

uncertainty. It is important that the fusion process be able to provide some measure of 

quality, uncertainty, and lineage with any results that are reported. In many instances, the 

fusion process is likely to initiate a need for additional information to be derived by 

database search, by tasking of sensor assets, or by executing additional fusion processes. 

8.2 Enabling Capabilities 

There are certain fundamental capabilities that are essential to enabling the adequate fusion 

of observations, particularly if these observations are from multiple, disparate sensors. 

These capabilities are essential for discovery of available resources, for determination of 

their spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships to one another, for processing low-level 

data to higher-level information, and for assessing the reliability and lineage of the 

information. 

These enabling capabilities include: 

 Precise geospatial and temporal registration of observations 

o Harmonized sensor models for supporting precise geolocation (e.g. 
Community Sensor Models – CSM) 

o Accurate and consistent time tagging of observation results 

o Ready access to on-demand and automatic georectification of observations 
within web services, agents, and client tools 

 Sensor and process descriptions, important for: 

o Discovery of available assets capable of meeting fusion needs 

o Observation lineage, providing a measure of Quality Control 

o Quality assurance based on observations and sensor/process characteristics 

o Enablement of on-demand processing of observations to higher-level 
information 



OGC 09-138

o Provides a taxonomy of sensors and processes 

 On-demand and automated observation processing (both web service and tool-
based) 

o Georegistration, georectification, and regridding 

o Image and signal processing 

o Advanced spatio-temporal processing, e.g., stereoscopy and oblique imagery 
reconstruction of 3D 

o Time differencing and change detection 

o Classification and signature matching 

o Object identification and pattern recognition 

 Harmonization and interoperable models and encodings for disparate sensors, 
observations, and processes 

o Development of common semantics for sensor observations, and processes  

o Online, referenceable dictionary/ontology of terms: Observable properties, 
Sensor and process properties, Relationships, and Recognized objects 

o Development of common profiles or models for sensors, observations, and 
processes 

o Use of a common encoding for sensors, processes, and encodings (e.g. 
SensorML, O&M with SWE Common) 

 Timely discovery of highly dynamic and mobile assets, observations, and alerts 

o Ability to obtain real-time knowledge of the availability of appropriate 
assets within an area of interest 

o Ability to rapidly update discovery registries based on streaming data 

o Ability to query sensor resources closer to the source (e.g. “Did you look at 
this particular area during this particular time?”) 

o Investigation into non-traditional means of discovery, including for instance 
peer-to-peer (P2P) and similar technologies 

 Efficient streaming protocols for delivery of large, real-time or archived 
observations (e.g. JPIP/JP2, RTSP, HTTP Streaming, etc.), as well as alerts 

o Maintaining sufficient metadata and semantics while supporting efficient 
encodings 

o Including support for on-demand geolocation and processing of streams  

o Accurate time-tagging of streaming observations (often essential for 
effective data fusion) 

 Security and Authentication for sensor and actuator assets 

o Classification tagging within encodings and service descriptions 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 17 

 

o Controlled access to discovery engines, decryptions, and web services 

o Protection of messages during transmission 

 Treating signatures as observations 

o Providing full lineage of signatures including sensors, processing, and the 
environment (typically itself measured with sensors) 

o Allowing easy discovery of signatures for particular sensor types and needs 

o Allowing easy access to signature with common formats 

o Allowing easy means of processing and comparing signatures against 
observations 

o Accumulating and mining the whole of observations as a means of deriving 
signatures and recognized patterns 

 Accounting for uncertainty 

o Providing common semantics of uncertainty (both with measurements and 
relationships) 

o Defining and tagging uncertainty within sensor, process, and observation 
metadata 

o Providing algorithms for the propagation of uncertainty (error) through a 
process chain 

o Providing means for improving uncertainty using measurements from 
disparate or multiple sensors (e.g. Bayesian methods) 

Some of these enabling capabilities exist to some degree but are in need of focus within 

research and implementation projects. Many of these capabilities have been enabled by 

technologies such as the SWE encodings and services, but the creation of semantics and 

profiles for sensors, processes, and web services would greatly improve the interoperability 

that is needed for achieving a high-degree of sensor fusion. 

As stated above, geospatial and temporal registration of observations is necessary for 

sensor fusion.  There are several approaches on how to achieve such registration including 

consideration of reformatting in a distributed environment.  PYXIS responded to the Fusion 

RFI promoting the use of a multi-resolution, equal-area, discrete global grid for aiding in 

the fusion process. Particularly focused on a hexagonal tessellation of the Earth called the 

optimized Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area aperture 3 Hexagon Grid (ISEA3H). With regard 

to sensor fusion, PYXIS advocates resampling sensor data to ISEA3H grid to aid in fusion 

and application of grid specific algorithms for image processing, pixel-to-pixel operations, 

and fusion. While the ISEA3H tessellation work is impressive and may be useful for an 

individual fusion algorithm; standardizing data exchange formats to a particular grid is too 

brittle of an approach for a distributed system.  A more robust process is to standardize how 

a dataset describes its gridding thereby allowing downstream fusion algorithms to re-grid if 

necessary as late as possible.  Such an approach – regrid as little and as late as possible – is 

supported by the existing SWE standards. 



OGC 09-138

As an example of the sensor fusion using open standards consider the approach developed 

by Fraunhofer and the SANY project (Figure 4). “Fraunhofer IITB has realized a testbed 

for sensors and services in order to test the architecture and specifications developed in the 

EU Project SANY (Sensors Anywhere) based on going work of OGC (in particular the 

Sensor Web Enablement suite of standards). At the sensor network level, an ad hoc wireless 

network (ZigBee) is complemented by simulated sensor nodes.” [FRA] 

 

Figure 4 – Sensor Fusion using SOS  

Based on the experience of this implementation, the Fraunhofer team‟s conclusions 

included:  

 OGC services were easily and rapidly deployed in typical environmental monitoring 
applications. The largely self-describing information sets (XML files in specific 

schemas) delivered by the services are an important step towards plug & measure of 

sensors and application components. The progress beyond proprietary exchange 

formats requiring customized processing is not to be underestimated.  

 However, further standardization work is required to harmonize the formal 
description of resources such as observed properties and to specify techniques to 

map between the resources defined in different expert communities.  One approach 

is to develop network accessible identifiers, e.g, URNs, that represent defined 

phenomena. 

8.3 Objects from Fusion Processes 

Objects resulting from sensor fusion processes include: 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 19 

 

 Recognition of an event or phenomenon as a feature of potential interest 

 Estimation of the attributes of geographic features including presence or absence  

 Location and geometric shape of physical entities  

 Estimation of physical and functional attributes of objects/features   

 Provenance and uncertainties of the information about objects. 

In the same way that Observations should be linked to the processes that created them (e.g. 

sensors and post-processing), Objects and object properties should be linked to the 

observations and fusion processes that allowed them to be identified and measured. This 

could be accomplished through links within the Object‟s XML instance that point to the 

observations that helped identify the object and discern the property value. Alternatively, 

and perhaps more practically, relationships could be provided outside of the XML using 

links (in databases or registries or ontologies) that allow one to discover linkage between 

observations and objects. 

8.4 Tools, Resources and Standards 

The ability to discover, access, and fuse multiple observations for the purpose of enhancing 

situation awareness is or will be enabled by the development, refinement, and 

implementation of several standards and tools. These resources include encoding for assets 

and data, web services for standard access to observations, sensor tasking, processing, and 

discovery, and software tools for processing, visualization, analysis, and decision support. 

The technologies and standards (emerging and adopted) thought to be relevant to enabling 

open and interoperable fusion in this category are identified in Table 3. 

The following standards (emerging and adopted) are thought to be relevant to enabling 

open and interoperable fusion in this category.  Standards are listed below in brief with full

8.5 Recommendations 

A key requirement for sensor fusion is the interoperability between disparate sensor 

systems and between different observation provider and consumer communities. The ability 

to fuse vital information from various observation sources is currently limited or inhibited 

by our inability to:  

 Discover available dynamic assets across domains, to access observations in a 
common format using common interfaces 

 Submit task requests through common interfaces and message structures 

 Readily feed all of these observation results into fusion processes.  

The appropriate profiling and implementation of open standards for sensor encodings and 

sensor web interfaces can greatly improve our abilities to achieve sensor fusion not only 

within traditional communities, but between communities who have traditionally found 

interoperability challenging because of differences in sensors, observations, and processing, 

differences in the ultimate application of the fusion processes, or simply due to multi-

agency differences.  



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 21 

 

The following recommendations are offered for improving our capabilities for employing 

sensor fusion readily and in a highly effective manner. 

8.5.1 Harmonization of the process of precise geolocation 

Harmonization of the process of precise geolocation has been improving with the efforts of 

the Community Sensor Model (CSM) Working Group, the near completion of the ISO 

19130 standards, based on CSM, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of encoding 

these models into SensorML. Such models have been shown to be applicable to remote 

sensors on-board satellite, aircraft, ship, mobile ground-based vehicles, and immobile 

stations. We feel that these efforts should continue and become more widely applied 

throughout the remote sensing communities. 

8.5.2 Online community sanctioned defintions for sensor terms  

The creation of sanctioned definitions and semantics within the sensor and data fusion 

communities is essential. Some activities are already underway in some communities, while 

many completed works exist in published documents. These efforts should be harmonized 

resulting in dictionaries and ontologies that are resolvable online and thus able to be 

utilized within metadata tags for sensor, observation, and process descriptions. 

8.5.3 Discovery and access of dynamic sensors 

It is vital for timely recognition of situation awareness that we are able to readily discover 

and access information about dynamic sensor assets that might be useful for us, to access 

observations or receive alerts from these systems in a readily meaningful and usable 

encoding, and to easily task these systems to provide much needed observations in order to 

fill gaps in our knowledge. Currently, timely discovery and access to highly dynamic assets 

is currently challenging at best.  Investigating alternatives for improving rapid discovery 

and access to highly-dynamic are encouraged, including investigations into non-traditional 

technologies such as P2P and the query of web services that are closer upstream to the 

sensor system.    

8.5.4 Characterizing and propogating uncertainty of measurements 

All measured and processed results include a certain degree of uncertainty. No 

measurement, no recognition of an object or event, and no determination of an object‟s 

properties are free from possible error and uncertainty. Errors and uncertainty can arise 

from inevitable limitations in the sensor systems, from errors introduced or propagated 

during the processing of the data, or in act of comparing observations with signatures taken 

under varying environmental conditions.  Thus, while it is important to minimize 

uncertainty, recognizing the amount of uncertainty in a result is equally important.  It is 

recommended that efforts be taken to define terms of uncertainty, to insure the inclusion of 

values of uncertainty within sensor and observations metadata, and to determine algorithms 

for propagating error through processing algorithms or workflows. 

8.5.5 Increasing use of geometric and electromagnetic signatures 

Since geometric and electromagnetic signatures can play a significant role in recognizing 

objects and events from measurements, and in determining their properties, it is important 

that the current state of managing signatures be improved. This includes expecting 



OGC 09-138 

22 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

signatures to be treated as we should treat observations. They should be provided with a 

complete description of the signature‟s lineage including a robust the sensor and process 

descriptions, measures of uncertainty, and a description of the environmental conditions 

under which they were measured. They should also utilize standardized terms and 

semantics, and should be easily discoverable and accessible. Furthermore when such 

information is provided for all observations, it can enable new paradigms for creating new 

signatures based on large numbers of observations taken under varying conditions. 

8.5.6 Fusion of video from airborne and ground based platforms 

Video from airborne (e.g., UAVs) and ground-based platforms provides a sensor source 

that both challenges many data handling systems, as well as provides opportunities for 

advanced fusion processing. Challenges include the need for common tasking interfaces for 

all UAVs and video systems, the difficulties in discovering coverages from highly dynamic 

sensor systems, the need for supporting large volumes of streaming data, the importance of 

efficient on-demand precise geolocation of video frames, the opportunity to derive 3D 

geometric from multiple frames, and the ability to derive advanced knowledge from 

temporal differences. It is recommended that profiles for airborne video be developed for 

SWE standards (particularly SensorML, O&M, SOS, and SPS) and that these be tested and 

demonstrated. 

8.5.7 Recognition and characterization of observed objects/features and events 

It is important to test and demonstrate whether existing standards and technologies can 

improve the connection between sensor measurements and the recognition and 

characterization of observed objects/features and events.  The process of sensor fusion for 

the purpose of object recognition and characterization can challenge traditional systems that 

struggle with disparities between both sensor systems and community standards. It is 

recommended that testbeds be establish to test and demonstrate the application of SWE 

standards for improving sensor fusion across various sensor communities and agencies.

9 Object/Feature Fusion 

9.1 Definition and Objectives 

9.1.1 Definition 

Object/Feature Fusion is the processing of multiple sources of observations and features 

into higher order semantic features using techniques for identifying, aggregating, relating, 

parsing, and organizing and includes feature processing such as generalization, conflation, 

feature extraction, and change detection.  Object/Feature fusion yields information 

resources that are more powerful, flexible, and accurate than any of the original sources. 

Users want to see domain specific objects presented to them in a manner relevant to the 

function being performed. For example in air navigation a user will be more interested in, 

say, „aerial obstructions‟ and will not usually care if it is a „communications tower‟. Given 

the continual requirement to cross-link information or use it in alternative contexts 

(information interoperability), it is very important to users that the information they see is 

consistent (or at worse has well defined inconsistency) with other information even if it is 

presented in a different form.  Envitia labels this harmonised information feed. 

Critical to Object/Feature Fusion is understanding and generating metadata that record the 

provenance (i.e., lineage, pedigree, chain of custody and processing) of the sources and the 

nature of feature fusion processes that have been applied to derive “value-added” 

information from them.  

The “end game” is to improve understanding of the operational situation and assessment of 

potential threats and impacts by integrating multiple data formats, data models, and tools to 

identify, classify, associate, and aggregate entities of interest (i.e., targets, features, tracks, 

objects, activities). The ability to automate processing and scale storage, network, and 

compute capabilities to suit growing data volumes and evolving analytical complexities 

becomes increasingly critical. 

As stated in the Fusion Categories (Section 6.2): The terminology for geographic 

information standards differs from terminology used in the field of image understanding3.  

A feature in the ISO 19100 series of standards is an "object" in image understanding 

terminology.  A geometric object identified in an image in the ISO 19100 series is a 

"feature" in image understanding terminology. 

9.1.2 The Feature Lifecycle 

The Feature Lifecycle concept introduces a model of managed, automated, scalable, and 

repeatable processes for handling geospatial feature objects as a “continuous response to 

observations made in the physical world and propositions about the state of the physical 

world that are represented in a digital world.”4  The model provides context for the role of 

Object/Feature fusion in a larger information production and management environment.  

From this perspective, feature fusion “encompasses a much broader scope of problem than 

                                                 

3 A discussion of the terminology can be found in ISO 19101-2 Geographic Information – Reference Model – Imagery  

4 Feature lifecycle presented here is derived from Northrop Grumman response to the Fusion RFI.

simply feature conflation” to include aspects such as spatio-temporal data models, active 

behavior through change/anomaly detection and triggered event processing, multi-source 

spatio-temporal discovery, and temporal conflation. 

 

Figure 5 – Feature Lifecycle5 

The emphasis of the Feature Lifecycle model is on managing, adapting, and responding to 

changing states of features and the “capabilities to manage change with dependencies upon 

external sources of knowledge.”  The core Object/Feature Fusion activities in the model 

are: 

Update/Add-Value – integrating data with processes and tools for identity resolution 

(matching observations and facts to individual object instances), feature extraction (from 

unprocessed geospatial and non-geospatial sources in order to rapidly generate features, 

their location, attributes, and metadata), and change/anomaly detection (to identify change 

in object state over time as well as to guide feature generation processes). 

Compare/Create Features – compare and assess the suitability (including e.g., quality, 

accuracy, currency, relevance, and information value) of objects, potentially creating new 

spatio-temporal objects in the process, and determining whether the objects are adequate 

for their purpose (in which case they are ready for publishing), inadequate (triggering, e.g., 

new collection and production activities), or require further value-add processing. 

                                                 

5 Adapted from Northrop Grumman response to Fusion RFI. 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 25 

 

Process Features – apply spatio-temporal-semantic operators to features to aggregate, 

relate, conflate, generalize, subset and filter the object/feature entities for use as input to 

decision-making processes. 

9.1.3 Object/Feature Fusion Viewpoints 

The Feature Lifecycle model can be further described, and related to the functional model 

above, from the perspectives of information and computation. Together these perspectives 

provide a more complete model of the Object/Fusion space. 

Information View – focuses on means for standardizing information content, semantics, 

data models, and schema thereby enabling interoperable processing and data sharing. 

Robust approaches to Object/Feature fusion must integrate and leverage each of these 

aspects of the model: 

 Semantic – representations of vocabulary and meaning enabling the ability to 
resolve identity, align schemas, relate features, and support higher-order 

classification and inference. 

 Schematic – representations of type, structure, and association of feature objects 
enabling the means to resolve identity, translate data across mixed schema, perform 

type conversions, etc. 

 Temporal – representations of temporal context and process necessary for identity 
resolution, change detection, tracking, relating, conflating, generalizing, filtering, 

etc. 

 Geometric – representations of spatial context and process for identity resolution, 
tracking, relating, conflating, generalizing, filtering etc. 

Computational view – the computational view focuses on the means for standardizing 

algorithms, components, interfaces, interactions, and workflows thereby enabling 

interoperable Object/Feature fusion services deployed in distributed, heterogeneous 

computing environments. Robust approaches to Object/Feature fusion must also integrate 

these computational aspects of the model: 

 Event processing – Supporting the more dynamic aspects of the Feature Lifecycle, 
including handling of object/feature state transitions, anomaly detection, automated 

triggering of processing, and just-in-time approaches to Object/Feature fusion. 

 Algorithm – The means for specifying computational patterns, approaches, and 
functions for solving complex problems. 

 Transformation – The means to align, filter, translate, and transform data efficiently 
and with minimal loss of information. 

 Workflow – The means to automate, integrate, and orchestrate Object/Feature 
fusion algorithms that also enable human input, monitoring, control, and feedback 

in support of business/mission-specific processes.

9.2 Enabling Capabilities 

The key analytical activities of Object/Feature fusion shown in Figure 1 are: entity 

association, aggregation and relational analysis, and identification of entity activities and 

their structural and functional changes in space and time. Enabling capabilities supporting 

feature fusion activities include: 

 Metadata for describing provenance, quality, and uncertainty 

 Data and service discovery 

 Data quality / uncertainty modeling and representations 

 Definition and use of common and mission-specific datasets/schemas with 
supporting tools for schema validation and schema mapping of datasets 

 Data integration, conflation and generalization (e.g., geometries, schemas, 
duplicates, associations, etc) 

 Spatial-Temporal-Semantic analytics (e.g., entity mapping, filtering, correlation, 
uncertainty modeling, simulation, visualization, etc.) 

 Data models, encodings and services for geoparsing, linking, organizing and sharing 
of fusion sources and outputs. Parsing and linking involves automated text 

recognition and association to location and other entities e.g., parsing a text 

document that contains the word-phrase “Baghdad” in it with detailed information 

about the city, and linking the document (and/or just the word-phrase in it) to a 

feature representation for the place called “Baghdad”. Organizing and sharing of 

fusion sources and products is accomplished using organizing constructs for 

tagging, categorizing, and grouping into digital structures such as folders, 

compound documents, or blogs for collaboration. 

 Geoprocessing workflow combines two concepts to achieve its value for the 
consumer: „geoprocessing‟ and „workflow‟. Geo-processing involves processing of 

spatially related data, which may fall into one or more of the following categories: 

Spatial processing, Thematic processing, Temporal processing, Metadata 

processing. Workflow involves automated or semi-automated sequencing of tasks 

and processing to enable standardized and repeatable business processes that can 

scale with demand. Workflows are typically scripted to process routinely available 

information but may also be triggered by external events or alerts. 

 Schema for interoperable definition of rules for geoprocessing. The rules can be 
inspected and compared and subsequently executed on a variety of workflow 

processing services. Rules-based services enable configurable, specialized, and 

tunable processing e.g., conflation. 

The following sections detail enabling capabilities in need of focus within research and 

implementation projects. Many of these have been developed or demonstrated in past OGC 

initiatives but require further specific refinement for purposes of developing Object/Feature 

fusion standards and demonstration in limited operational settings. 



OGC 09-138

9.2.1 Provenance Metadata 

Object/Feature fusion processes must both consume and produce provenance metadata – 

the trace (a graph) of ancestor and descendant data and processes that are used, produced 

and transformed at each step (a graph node) in the feature lifecycle (a workflow). The 

derivation history of a data product or feature used as input to Object/Feature fusion 

processes or produced as output, must address questions such as these:  

  What created the feature? When and where? 

  What were the parameters and configuration used? 

  What were the input data used? 

Critical to the feature lifecycle are these activities in which provenance metadata plays an 

important role: 

  Trace workflow execution: What services were used in a fusion workflow? Were 
all steps completed and successful/valid? 

 Auditing: What resources were used during fusion workflow? 

 Data quality and reuse: what applications/services were used to derive results? 
Which workflows use a certain data product? 

 Attribution: Who performed the work? Who owns the workflow and data products? 

 Discovery: Where is the resulting dataset? What workflows were executed using 
Service-Y? 

9.2.2 Uncertainty Metadata 

Uncertainty metadata provides the means to quantify and evaluate data quality and is, 

according to the Aston University response to the RFI, at the heart of useful Object/Feature 

fusion approaches. Aston argues that “probabilistic modeling for combining and relating 

features from a range of processing methods” is necessary.  Achieving this is especially 

challenging when considering that different processing methods in a Object/Feature fusion 

workflow will likely yield very different associated uncertainties. The Aston premise is that 

a probabilistic representation of uncertainty provides a “common language between a wide 

range of models, applications, and measurements” and is needed at all stages of 

Object/Feature fusion and throughout the Feature Lifecycle. 

9.2.3 Object/Feature Associations 

In the conception of Object/Feature fusion posited in the Galdos response to the Fusion 

RFI, “two data elements can be said to be fused if there exists an association between them, 

or if they are a member of a package of elements that defines that association.” From an 

information viewpoint, additional information (e.g., algorithms) may also be attached to an 

association that may be used to further process the associated items. When considering 

associations in the context of the Feature Lifecycle, tools and services for creating, 

managing, and exploiting associations become essential. Catalog Services (e.g., OGC 

CSW-ebRIM) for management and discovery of associations, packages, and classifications 

can play an important enabling role – a key element of the computational perspective. 



OGC 09-138

Features may be dynamic, with time-varying properties including time-varying geometry 

and topology. Modeling the associations between time-varying features and their properties 

provides a robust mechanism for dynamically “fusing” Objects/Features for purposes of 

tracking, detecting change, and triggering actions (e.g., sensor collection tasking, alerts, 

etc). 

Galdos argues that controlled vocabularies of association types are a key part of an 

Object/Feature fusion information model and are necessary for automation. Such a set of 

association types may include: 

 Same Type – two or more features (with different schema) represent the same thing 

 Generalizes – geometrically/topologically a generalization of another 

 Evolves-From – a feature evolves over time into another 

 Spatially-Related – features in spatial proximity or topology 

 Temporally-Related – features related temporally (e.g., by time instant, time 
period, or time series) 

 Topically-Related – features related by topic or theme 

 Decision-Related – features related to a specific decision 

In a similar fashion, FortiusOne identifies the key functionality of joining data feeds to 

arbitrary geometries on the fly based through toponyms, addresses or coordinates.  This 

capability can be extended to provide spatial aggregation of data to geometries allowing the 

aggregated data to be summed, averaged, and ranged or any other statistical function 

enabling better consumption and analysis of sensor data. 

9.2.4 Conflation & Generalization 

Conflation is the process of unifying multiple separate sources of data into one integrated 

result.  Conflation may be applicable to both raster sources and vector sources. Digital 

representations of geospatial features (such as roads, rivers, and forests) vary between 

databases, and while conflation processing is akin to forming a union between databases, 

differences in how features are represented in each database makes forming an integrated 

result challenging.  When features from different sources are superimposed, they will 

typically differ in alignment, precision, location, completeness, and potentially in geometric 

representation as well.  Not initially visible are differences in attribution and topology.   

The core of the conflation process is identifying and associating the common features 

across multiple data sources, in spite of aforementioned challenges, reconciling the 

differences between them, and constructing one integrated result.  The integrated result 

should contain: all the unique features and all the unique attributes from the sources being 

processed, the “best” geospatial representation of features deemed to be common, the 

combined attribution for features in common, and where values differ for attributes in 

common, the “best” value likewise must prevail as well. 

Conflation capabilities may include: 

 Pre-processing (transformation of schema, projection, datum, topology quality 
assessment, generalization or geometry simplification) 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 29 

 

 Feature matching criteria and methods 

 Preconfliction (merge/map schemas, integrate features, edge matching, etc) 

 Imagery search and retrieve and image matching 

9.2.5 Harmonised Information Feed 

One goal is a common approach to the process of harmonisation and fusion. It is important 

first of all to define concepts of source and target and then define the harmonisation 

mapping between them. Envitia has identified a number of common requirements for 

harmonisation through their research with our stakeholder groups.  These are: 

 Thematic Harmonisation.  This refers to the standardisation of a set of features 
based on an identified theme. (e.g., find all 'Transportation Routes', find all 'Roads 

and/or Tracks'). 

 Feature Concept Harmonisation. This refers to the standardisation of a set of 
features based on a common feature concept definition.  

 Feature Type Harmonisation. This refers to the standardisation of a set of features 
based on a common feature type definition. For example harmonising where, say, 

the real-world "church" entity is modelled in one case as a Church feature or in 

another case as a Building feature with property restriction 

categoryOfBuilding=Church. 

 Geometric Harmonisation. Features are often represented by different geometric 
representations. For example a contoured representation as opposed to a tin or 

coverage, or a road centre line and width as opposed to a polygon. 

 Coordinate Reference System and Unit Harmonisation. Feature attribution often 
makes reference to units of measure or coordinate reference systems. Conversions 

between these are already granular and well defined. 

 Metadata Harmonisation. This refers to standardisation of the use of metadata 
objects to represent the "meta" characteristics of a feature in a consistent way. In 

some schemas accuracy is in the metadata whilst in others it is in the data schema. 

 Carrier Harmonisation. Data is often encoded in different carrier models. In this 
case harmonisation refers to the standardisation of the use of particular exchange or 

boundary formats. 

 Portrayal Harmonisation. In this case harmonisation refers to the standardisation of 
the use of particular portrayal specifications, including the symbol sets/rules. SLD is 

doing this well for vector but gridded data does not have a similar set of definitions. 

 

9.2.6 Feature Fusion Workflows 

Combining conflation and conflation rules services within a service-oriented architecture 

with workflow is an enabling enabling technology for Decision Fusion. As part of the 

OWS-5 test bed a sample set of conflation rules were to be implemented to prove the 



OGC 09-138 

30 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

concept of rule-based conflation (See Figure 6) 6.  The OWS-5 implementation used a 

Topology Quality Assessment Service (TQAS) that was developed in OWS-47.   

 

Figure 6 – Feature Fusion workflow example 

 As discussed in the NGC response to the RFI: “Selecting the “best” of all sources to be 

conflated is not a one-size-fits-all problem, subject to the actual feature data being 

processed, user knowledge and expertise, and other criterion.  As such, a comprehensive set 

of business rules is necessary to control aspects of the process such as feature prioritization, 

attribute handling, coding standard conversions, and more.” 

NGC notes that several conflation engines exist commercially (Automated Conflation 

Service™ (ACS™), Fusion, MapMerger, Conflex, Radius) and are designed to use 

proprietary algorithms and methods for competitive advantage. Therefore, a subset of 

conflation rules is expected to remain specific to a conflation engine in order to control the 

proprietary algorithms. 

The Intergraph response to the RFI notes that they support similar functionality as their 

customers want these capabilities available as services that can be chained together into 

higher order workflows.  “How to access these functions and orchestrate are keys to further 

standardization.”

“For interoperability, these rules require a 

common schema and web service interface 

for storage, discovery and reuse.  An XML 

schema for feature similarity called 

FeatSim was designed to be a non-

proprietary definition of business rules that 

are shared among conflation applications 

and services. The schema for FeatSim is 

modeled in Figure 7.  The schema also 

defines metadata for search of business 

rules in a catalog. WPS defines a 

standardized interface that facilitates the 

publishing of geospatial processes, and the 

discovery of and binding to those processes 

by clients. The conflation clients and 

engines could use the WPS interfaces to 

query the rules, but WPS lacks an metadata 

query interface for discovery. Therefore, 

the OGC Catalog Web Service is a 

preferable alternative for storage, discovery 

and retrieval if the catalog‟s metadata can 

be adapted in a profile to store and query 

the metadata for conflation business rules. 

 

9.2.7 Geoparser, Geocoder, Gazetteer, and Location Organizer Folder8 

In an operational setting, the Location Organizer Client (LOC) is used by analysts to 

compile related sets of spatial-temporal information from multi-source information for any 

intelligence problems. Analysts capture and manage information in LOFs. Cooperating 

analysts use LOCs and supporting workflows and rules to discover, access, register, 

correlate and analyze information and then store and share the resulting LOFs. In the figure 

below, the GFS Environment consisting of applications, workflows, business rules, and 

services used to manage LOFs. 

 Location Organizer Client (LOC) – client application that integrates multiple 
services for viewing, editing, discovery, analysis, publishing and collaboration. 

 Location Organizer Folder (LOF) – means for storing, associating, and managing 
spatial-temporal resources as a geo-organized, geo-connected collection of 

information; a structured way to associate, organize, and share relevant information 

about a topic of interest. 

                                                 

8 The LOC, LOF – along with geoparsing, geolinking, geocoder, and gazetteer services –were constructs conceived and 
demonstrated during OGC‟s Geospatial Fusion Services Testbed and Pilot initiatives in 2000-2001. A LOF is a structured 
way to associate, organize, encode, and share relevant information about a topic of interest.

9.5 Recommendations  

9.5.1 Define a conceptual model of feature lifecycle – beyond conflation. 

Object/Feature fusion has been shown to be larger in scope than a “traditional” feature 

conflation problem, encompassing spatio-temporal-semantic models for discovery, 

temporal conflation, active/dynamic behaviors for event processing of detected changes and 

anomalies, and leveraging semantics for rules and reasoning.   Development of a 

conceptual model, like the “feature lifecycle” model discussed above, is needed to provide 

context for and unification of the functional, informational, and computational aspects of 

Object/Feature fusion. Such a model will also provide the basis for operational exploitation 

of the full scope of fusion services and a roadmap for addressing key interoperability 

bottlenecks with standards developed through multiple phases in multi-participant 

activities.

OGC 09-138

9.5.2 Standardize metadata for provenance and uncertainty.  

Fusion is a hard problem in part because we are drowning in a volume of data from 

multiple sources, all with different levels of detail and uncertainty. The challenge in 

Object/Feature fusion is not getting data but making sense of them!  While it is important to 

minimize the introduction of uncertainty during processing and handling of data, it is 

equally important to recognize and quantitatively characterize the uncertainty in a result. 

Quantitative representations of uncertainty support provenance (history of a data product) 

within the feature lifecycle model.  The use of metadata, and specifically uncertainty 

metadata, must be shown in real-world/practical fusion scenarios. UncertML should be 

considered with evaluation of the Gaussian model for the variety of types of uncertainty. 

Demonstration of methods and tools for creating and interoperably using provenance and 

uncertainty metadata to support automation and improved (faster, valid, more accurate) 

fusion results is needed. 

9.5.3 Develop common data models supporting feature fusion. 

Common data models and encoding patterns are needed for representing feature semantics, 

feature associations, and their geometry, topology, and temporal properties in standard 

ways for enabling interoperable Object/Feature fusion.  Elements of the data model include 

common ontologies, vocabularies and taxonomies, association types, link encoding 

mechanisms/patterns, and the means for publishing/sharing/processing of “fused” features. 

Clearly GML and O&M are the starting-point for an Object/Feature fusion model. Such 

models and patterns are essential for interoperable transformation and automated 

processing of data in fusion workflows. With stable and finite representations of features 

(i.e., their structure, associations, and semantics) derived from a common data model, come 

the means for discovery, transformation, and reasoning in support of compose-able and 

higher-order Object/Feature fusion capabilities needed to solve increasingly more complex 

problems and to share the results. 

9.5.4 Define a portfolio of feature fusion services. 

The computational toolkit for Object/Feature fusion is large and varied. Tools and services 

for creating and managing associations exist or have been recently proposed. Tools and 

services for rules-based conflation have been demonstrated. COTS tools are available for 

advanced processing of feature geometries for generalization (simplifying, aggregating, 

merging, collapsing). Mechanisms exist for parsing non-geospatial data, linking, tagging, 

and organizing them to form “fused” information products packaged for sharing. Many of 

these capabilities are “locked-up” in desktop applications and tools, not easily accessible 

over networks or interoperable across implementations. What is needed is a “portfolio” of 

fusion services defining standard, interoperable, compose-able service interfaces enabling 

wider (Web or SOA-based) access and orchestration of disparate fusion services into 

workflows supporting decision-fusion and other means of making sense out of the volume 

of data and complexity of the problems that confront us. 

9.5.5 Develop schema and encoding to support sharing of Track Features  

Today‟s family of tracking and fusion applications are capable of operating in a broad 

range of physical and tactical environments. The data format for a track must be sufficient 

to address the needs of the individual sensors in the sensor suite, plus those of the different 



OGC 09-138

levels of fused tracks.   NGC offers a Track Object Format (TOF) including an interface 

and data structures of a neutral track format. The TOF is a generalized format for the 

representation of track data – fused or un-fused – in a bandwidth-challenged, time-

constrained embedded processing environment.

10 Decision Fusion  

10.1 Definition and Objectives 

10.1.1 Definition  

Decision Fusion focuses on client environments for analysts and decision makers to 

visualize, analyze, and edit data into fusion products for an understanding of a situation in 

context. Decision fusion includes the ability to fuse derived data and information with 

processes, policies, and constraints. Collaboration with other analysts is done using social 

networking services and collaboration tools that are location enabled.  

Several responses to the Fusion Standards RFI commented on the Decision Fusion 

Category: 

• Aston University: “…a correct assessment of the uncertainty about the particular 
„thing‟ must be propagated correctly along the entire processing chain.” And  

“Communicating uncertain information to users is a non-trivial task, and remains an 

open research question.” 

• FortiusOne:  fusion by visualizing and analyzing data, driving data backed decisions 
and solving problems with no prior training using traditional mapping tools  

• Fraunhofer: “Processing of sensor data together with general, prior knowledge of 
the phenomenon of interest” 

• Galdos:  data fusion from our perspective is the creation of a collection of named 
and possibly typed associations between instances of typically disparate data types.  

• PYXIS:  “Network-centric fusion requires that information is pre-aligned to a 
uniform model (or can be rapidly aligned) so that all data sets are self 

synchronized.” 

10.1.2 Decision Data Fusion Objectives 

The Decision Fusion Engineering Report (ER) addresses how data sources are integrated 

into a fusion processes and how the fusion processes provide input to the decision making 

process.  The objectives for fusion in this category include: 

 Discovery of data (static and dynamic) resources that meet a users immediate 
requirements and to make those resources part of a fusion process under the control 

of the decision maker or analyst. 

 Retrieval of real-time or time-series data in standard encodings that provide the 
ability to fuse the data into useable information based upon the users uncertainty of 

the measurement and parameters needed to process the data 

 Determination of the quality and validity of the data and fusion products produced 
from the data 

 Ability to fuse derived data and information with processes, policies, and constraint 
information as set by the data/information owners (i.e., Concept of Operations) and 

decision services processing nodes. 



OGC 09-138 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 37 

 

 Ability to present the derived information in a spatial client application (e.g., SLD, 
SE, W3D) including portrayal of maps and 3D visualization. 

 Ability to collaborate with other decision makers and analysts using social 
networking services and collaboration tools that are location enabled.  Documents 

that capture an analysis result and allows for distribution to others for viewing the 

same context.  

While Sensor Fusion and Feature Fusion provide the “right data”, Decision Fusion provides 

that information in the “right time and for the right place”.  Decision Fusion pulls together 

Sensor Fusion and Feature fusion results, combines those with additional data inputs to 

provide a result on which decisions or actions can be executed.  Fixed and mobile sensors 

of many kinds, including Full Motion Video, are providing dynamic data and emerging 

location-based services.  

10.1.3 Mirror Worlds 

With incredible prescience in 1991, David Gelernter put forth the concept of Mirror 

Worlds10 as “software models of some chunk of reality, some piece of the real world going 

on outside your window.  Oceans of information pour endlessly into the model (through a 

vast maze of software pipes and hoses): so much information that the model can mimic the 

reality‟s every move, moment-by-moment.”  Such a Mirror World could answer the 

question: “what‟s going on out there?  What‟s happening?”  

Many of Gelernter‟s Mirror World concepts now exist in some fashion through Internet 

access to databases and sensors.  A novel concept of Mirror Worlds that has not been 

realized is the notion of a “FGP Machine, after its three operations – called Fetch 

Generalize and Project.”  Fetch is plunge.  Generalize is squish.  Project allows you to pick 

what you want from a squish. 

Plunge looks around in a database for other cases that are similar to a new case that is of 

current interest.  A case is similar to the extent that its attributes match those of the new 

case.  The cases that are close to the new one are the cases that tend to match on evocative 

attributes. 

Squish means to look at the closest cases that are attracted by a plunge, and compact the 

together in to a single “super case.”  Squish helps to build abstract ideas out of concrete 

memories.  The way to attach meaning to a label is by plunging and squishing. 

There are many research efforts that seek to achieve the vision of plunge and squish, e.g., 

knowledge engineering, induction, and semantic web.  As these research efforts produce 

practical results they will advance our capabilities of decision fusion.

10.2 Enabling Capabilities 

10.2.1 Decision support services 

The fundamental concept underlying Decision Fusion is that a decision maker is able to sit 

down at a single workstation, identify any resource anywhere, access that resource, bring it 

into their operational context, integrate it with other resources to support the decision 

process, and to share the resulting context with others.  All of this takes place in a global 

enterprise made up of many different organizations and many different information 

communities.  Each of them has their own information models and semantics as well as 

their own policies and procedures.  Decision Fusion tools allow the decision maker to 

navigate this environment with minimal distraction from the issue at hand. Figure 9 

displays a generic view of the Decision Support Services (DSS) concept:   

 

Figure 9 – Decision Fusion Integrated Client 

At the heart of Figure 9 is an integrated client that allows a user to visualize, analyze, 

and/or edit data from feature, imagery, video and sensor web data sources within a single 

client.   The integrated client allows the user to fuse information from various sources into a 

common view or context to convey a conclusion about a specific geographic situation and 

to share and collaborate the perspective.   

Decision fusion happens within and between client applications.  Within the context of the 

OGC, this means that the integrated client allows a user to publish, discover, access, 

integrate and apply all types of spatial data (e.g., raster, vector, coverages and sensor 

observations) from a wide range of vendor web services through OGC standard interfaces.   

Integrated client applications provide access to distributed functionality in the following 

categories:  

 Service Discovery & Binding  

 Feature Production  



OGC 09-138

 Imagery Production/Exploitation  

 Sensor Web Planning/Exploitation  

 Project Persistence and Sharing 

 Process and Policy Services 

 Portrayal of 2D/3D geospatial information  

 Utilization of emergency alerting and situational awareness updates 

 Collaboration encodings: KML, OWS Context, LOF 

 

10.2.2 Decisions as information objects 

Decision fusion can be seen as the top of the information pyramid both in terms of 

information consumption and in terms of generating requests for new information. 

As Galdos identifies, “Decision making is about making choices amongst alternatives 

(decision tree).  It should be noted, however, that the set of choices might be quite dynamic 

and evolve in the course of an event (i.e. driven by the evolution of the event), or in an 

event independent manner. Decision makers want to learn from past mistakes (and are often 

also liable for their actions) hence the ability to automatically maintain an audit trail of 

decisions and their connection to particular feature and sensor information is critical.” 

An information model for decisions is not readily available, e.g., an abstract model in UML 

with Decision Type as a first class object with attributes, operations and associations.   

Such a model of decisions would then allow for placing decision instances in a registry for 

rapid reuse in situation as typical to a specific operational environment.   As Galdos points 

out, “this would include such things as dynamic decision trees, stored queries related to 

decision types, and specific types of auditable events.” 

10.2.3 3D Visualization for Built Environment  

A key aspect for establishing context is the visualization of an environment, including the 

built environment.  The surveying and photogrammetry community are developing broad-

scale, wholesale three-dimensional models of cities; architects and engineers are 

developing very detailed infrastructure models, and ordinary citizens are using free tools to 

create and share models of their neighborhoods.   Such information about the built 

environment includes 

 Buildings 

 Transportation infrastructure 

 Utilities infrastructure 

 Other physical infrastructure and their surroundings  

There are many types of documents or data objects that might be referenced to the built 

infrastructure and natural environments.  The documents and data may be items such as 

evacuation plans, road conditions, inventories of hazardous materials, current environment 



OGC 09-138 

40 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

indicators and weather conditions that would be useful to be able to discover and access 

based on references to locations.   

10.2.4 Events and Alerts 

Key inputs to Decision Fusion are events and alerts.  OGC has developed several services 

related to notification WNS, SAS, and recently a subscription service for to events.  Other 

communities have defined event encodings such as Common Alerting Protocol from 

OASIS and Cursor on Target from the Air Force.  OASIS also defines web service 

mechanisms for communicating events and alerts, e.g., WS-eventing, WS-Messaging.  In 

OWS-6, an Event Architecture was developed for use with OGC services.11   The event 

service was implemented for an air flight diversion scenario in OWS-6.  Work on events 

and alerts work should be continued in future developments. 

As Galdos states: “Decision makers are very busy, hence it is important that the fusion 

system be able to automatically notify them of important events.  Such events can be 

widely varying and include such things as arrival of new sensor information, the creation of 

a feature instance from observations, fusion of features or sensor data, or the evolution of 

some feature past an important critical point (e.g. fire comes within 500 meters of a town 

boundary).   As decision makers are very busy many of these processes (data association, 

aggregation etc) must be automated and happen at the database or mid-tier levels but be 

capable of being communicated immediately to the user interface level.  “ 

10.2.5 Fetch, Generalize and Project 

Decision support includes fetching historical cases similar to those of the current decision 

case, generalizing the historical cases, and projecting the generalized results that most 

relevant to current case.   

As example of this kinds of operations consider Google‟s MapReduce, which is a 

programming model, composed of separate Map and Reduce operations12.  (Here Map is 

not a geographic concept.) MapReduce is used for the generation of data for Google‟s 

production web search service.  Hadoop includes an open source implementation of 

MapReduce.  MapReduce has been used as inspiration in development of at least one WPS 

used in a grid computing operation13.  Applying MapReduce to geospatial decision fusion 

perhaps through WPS interface could achieve some decision fusion objectives. 

10.2.6 Information Collaboration  

Decision Fusion includes collaboration of various persons in developing an understanding 

of a specific context.  Collaboration with other decision makers and analysts can be 

accomplished using social networking services and collaboration tools that are location 

enabled.  One enabling element of collaboration is encoding methods for capturing and 

sharing the context or picture created by one analyst to be shared with others.  Several of 

these encoding methods are described in the following.

 Location Organizer Folder (LOF) 

The Location Organizer Folder (LOF) is a GML document that provides a structure for 

organizing the information related to a particular event or events of interest. It may be used 

in various analysis applications, like disaster analysis, Intelligence analysis, etc. It is 

spatially enabled, and capable of managing disparate types of information. 

The LOF is an information structure. There may be a variety of services external to the 

LOF that provide the means for generation and manipulation of the information in the 

structure. This includes search and discovery, parsing different resources and the extraction 

of useful information, assigning spatial attributes, relating (linking) resources of interest, 

and so on. 

 OWS Context 

OWS Context document is an XML encoding that references remote and/or local OGC 

Web Services.  OWS Context is related to, but more powerful than, Web Map Context. 

Web Map Context specification states how a specific grouping of one or more maps from 

one or more WMS can be described in a portable, platform-independent format for storage 

in a repository or for transmission between clients.  OWS Context can reference WMS and 

other OGC Web Services such as WFS and WCS. 

 KML 

KML is an XML grammar used to encode and transport representations of geographic data 

for display in an earth browser, such as a 3D virtual globe, 2D web browser application, or 

2D mobile application. A KML instance is processed in much the same way that HTML 

(and XML) documents are processed by web browsers. Like HTML, KML has a tag-based 

structure with names and attributes used for specific display purposes. 

10.2.7 Geospatial Fusion Engine  

In an operational setting, the decision fusion services are used by analysts to compile 

related sets of spatial-temporal information from multi-source information for a specific 

context.  There is a need for increasingly capable client applications or “fusion engines” 

that can support decision fusion as shown in Figure 10.   

The FortiusOne GeoIQ platform allows results of any analysis or data aggregation to be 

visualized including dynamic aggregation and disaggregation of data.  Data can be also 

visualized through its temporal dimensions by animation and filtering.  Any of these 

analyses or visualization can be shared as embeddable objects into a variety of Web based 

collaboration software (wiki‟s, blogs, web pages etc.).”

10.2.8 Dynamic routing based on location 

When it comes to distributing alerts, “where” is as important as “what” because only 

organizations with authorization and jurisdiction should be notified about each situation, 

otherwise they could be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of events.  Events typically 

include a defined location either by location identifier (e.g. zip code) or by coordinate 

geometry (e.g. polygon).  Routing based upon location in high volume messaging 

environments must move beyond the DBMS-based approach to a streaming approach.  For 

example, Solace Systems14 has a hardware-based messaging technology that can route 

messages based upon location.  An example use case is to identify the overlap between 

multiple polygons to determine message routing.  The need for open standards for this high 

volume messaging use case is clear from other Internet applications.  Open standards are 

needed for messages including location and the service protocols for interacting with 

message routers. 

10.3 Objects from Fusion Processes 

Objects resulting from decision fusion processes include: 

 Informed decisions based upon the data, information, policy and procedures being 
fused together.

10.5 Recommendations  

10.5.1 Develop  a information model with decisions as a first class object 

Interoperability in distributed information systems is dependent upon a rich understanding 

of the information to be shared.  For Decision Fusion an information model should be 

developed treating “Decision” as a first class object.  The model needs to be done at 

abstract and implementation levels.  The abstract model should define the attributes, 

operations and associations of a decision.  For example a decision object should include an 

aggregation with decision trees, policies and audit trail.  The decision object should include 

geospatial data and non-geospatial data.  This abstract decision object should then be tested 

with real decisions from routine operational settings.  Realizations of the decision should be 

made so that decision types can be used in registry and encodings defined for exchange.

10.5.2 Define interfaces and functionality for decision fusion engine component type 

As defined in Figure 11, a Decision Fusion Engine is conceived as a component that has 

access to streams of information relevant to an operational decision setting.  The fusion 

platform would create visualizations, and support analysis of aggregated data.  Temporal 

analysis should also be supported by animation and filtering.  Any of these analyses or 

visualization can be shared as embeddable objects into a variety of Web based 

collaboration software (wiki‟s, blogs, web pages etc.).  Interfaces for the engine need to be 

defined for both service interfaces as well as human-machine interfaces.   One result of this 

effort would be a best practice similar to the OGC Geospatial Portal Reference 

Architecture. 

10.5.3 Uncertainty propagation for a “hard fusion” topic 

A theme across all of the fusion categories has been uncertainty propagation.  This theme 

should continue in Decision Fusion.  Methods for propagating uncertainty into a decision 

framework are needed.   Methods for presenting uncertain information in human-machine 

interface are needed.  Communicating uncertain information to users is a non-trivial task 

and must build upon the results of on-going research.  Development of this topic should 

begin with a “hard fusion” topic, i.e., a topic for which the uncertainty can be calculated 

from input uncertainty values.  Mathematical formulas to combine various reliability 

components and associated data elements into a useable output(s) in a dynamic 

environment is needed.  This proof of concept would focus on hard fusion while 

recognizing that soft fusion is still in scope. Change Detection might be considered as the 

topic.  

10.5.4 “See and Talk” collaboration with common view 

For decision making in a collaborative environment, communications mechanisms and 

services are needed.  As demonstrated in OWS-3, a video feed from a UAV over a fire 

location is broadcast to several locations.  The several locations are connected so that they 

can see the same video, with the ability for each location to highlight a location on the 

video for the other locations to see.  While sharing and co-interacting this common picture 

the locations are able to talk and chat.  The result being artifacts to be saved and made part 

of the decision object.  This coordination can be achieved with OWS Context, KML, LoF, 

and other mechanisms.  This would require that OWS Context be extended to support 

imagery, video, audio, digital data, map represented data – for multi-int fusion. 

10.5.5 Coordination through social networks 

To be effective decision fusion must go beyond a strictly geospatial context.   This 

broadening must bring other data types as well as interaction with broader standards 

communities.  Social networks to collaborate, develop common understanding and make 

decisions should become part of our understanding of decision fusion.  Use of technologies 

like wikis and blogs that are spatially enabled and support the decision object approach 

defined above, would provide a basis for collaborative decision making. 



OGC 09-138

10.5.6 Political Geography as a step to all information types 

Political geography can be a basis for broadening future developments of decision fusion.  

This would include topics of human culture mapping, text scanning/language translations, 

place names and historical events with vague location that are identified by dates.  One 

element of this direction would be temporally enabled gazetteer.  Incorporating current 

social events through new feeds and blogs supported by Internet technologies such as RSS 

and Atom. 

10.5.7 Dynamic routing based on location 

Methods based on open standards are needed to quickly communicate situation conditions 

and response of decisions makers to a large number of people in a specific geographic 

region.  These announcements need to be coordinated though standards from a variety of 

communities, e.g., emergency response community using CAP and EXDL-DE.  Methods 

involving dynamic high-speed routing of alerts to geographic regions are needed.  This 

notification needs to include the availability data (maps, digital data, imagery) based on 

geographic area of interest 

10.5.8 Phase 2 Study on Decision Fusion 

For successful decision fusion, the information taken into consideration must be as broad as 

possible for all thematic domains and through a broad variety of technology platforms.  

Thematically, decision fusion must be fully encompassing of a multi-INT approach.  For 

technology platforms, decision fusion must consider standards that will enable a broader 

solution, e.g., mass markets and mashups.  To address this, it is recommended that a Phase 

2 of Fusion Standards Study to focus on Decision Fusion (Multi-INT)

11 Architecture for Fusion 

11.1 Definition and Objectives 

The most effective environment for accomplishing the various types of fusion is expected 

to be a network-centric architecture with distributed databases and services based on a 

common core of standards-based data formats, algorithms, services, and applications. These 

would allow geospatial information (and other forms of INT) to be collected, stored, 

managed, fused and disseminated vertically (from the National to the Soldier level) and 

horizontally (peer to peer). 

A fusion environment involves people, processes, data, and technology that combine 

functional information with information about space and time (Figure 11).  This means 

combining information from ISR, C2, planning assets, and Multi-INT in space and time in 

order to assemble, relate, and coordinate relevant information from a variety of disparate 

sources (soldiers, systems and other assets) and to provide a common situational 

understanding and a cohesive set of decision solutions. The fusion architecture will 

facilitate system interoperability, which is the capability of components or systems to share 

data and services with other components or systems and to perform in multiple 

environments. 

The discussion that follows is intended to be informative, providing an operational, 

technical and performance context for Fusion Services. 

In the conceptual fusion environment depicted in Figure 11, there are aggregator, processor 

and viewer services supporting collecting and consolidating, generating and synthesizing, 

and viewing and filtering activities, respectively. Information flows in various raw, 

processed, and fused representations into the fusion environment via network linkages 

enabled by connections between external source nodes and interoperability nodes. Seamless 

and interoperable flows between aggregators, processors, viewers, workflows, and client 

applications occur via Interoperability Nodes within the fusion environment. Information 

flows with external resources often occur via translator (gateway/guard) nodes. 

Interoperability Nodes and External Source Nodes may support a variety of service and 

encoding standards, supporting both producer and consumer interconnections.

11.2 Enabling Capabilities 

11.2.1 Distributed Information Systems 

There are certain infrastructure capabilities that are essential to enabling fusion. These 

capabilities are essential for distributed information systems in general, but may have 

particular requirements or emphasis for fusion processes.  Some relevant enabling 

capabilities are: 

 Scalable to massive data volumes and complex processing 

 Streaming and caching  

 Managed and hosted (distributed, off-premise) 

 Automated and manage processing and workflows 

 Reliable and available 

 Security in distributed information systems 

 Distributed, virtualized nodes made accessible and interconnected via open Web 
services and standards-based grid and cloud-computing infrastructures 

 Scalable, reliable, cost-effective storage, network and computing capabilities for 
enabling fusion.

The example architecture shown in Figure 12 enables the fusion of geospatial data 

among sensors, image libraries, geospatial products, and other intelligence data sources. 

In the figure, the Enterprise Services level include Sensor and Feature fusion processing 

in the Processing Services. These processing services for fusion include feature 

conflation and image enhancement that use multiple sources from the information and 

data management level, brokered through standard information exchange mechanisms. 

Discovery of fusion sources; schema and business rules for conflation would be the 

provided through the Discovery services. Decision level fusion is provided through 

Information Management services and Integrated Clients as part of the Enterprise 

Applications.  Workflows at the Enterprise Management level provide the logical flow 

and chaining to run services together in application of fusion for clients, whether a 

person using a client interface or another web service.

11.2.2 Catalogue as a cross-fusion resource 

A key pattern in a services architecture is “publish-find-bind.”  This pattern and other 

variants depend on having access to information about on-line resources through catalogues

or more generally through registries.  Galdos response to the Fusion RFI recommends the 

use of registries at multiple levels of the architecture to manage key artifacts including units 

of measure, coordinate reference systems, feature classification hierarchies, feature 

ontologies, feature/sensor/decision associations, service offers, feature schemas, sensor 

models and decision trees (See Figure 13). 

OGC members are working with several registry technologies including approved standards 

for CSW with extensions using ebRIM.  Further work by OGC members is using ebXML 

RegRep.

11.2.3 Support for multiple web service architectural styles 

Many of the services we discuss in this report are web services.  There are several 

architectural styles for defining web services.  The two most commonly discuss approaches 

are SOAP and REST.  Each approach has advantages so the key is to choose the approach 

that works best for a particular environment.  The OGC approach19 is to promote 

development of platform-independent abstract specifications and platform-dependent 

implementation specifications for all OGC service standards that support both procedure-

oriented and resource-oriented service styles or patterns.  

11.2.4 Geoprocessing Workflow 

In enterprise environments, it becomes necessary to produce complex functional 

capabilities that are composed from a variety of existing services using workflow 

orchestration and choreography. These technologies have mostly focused on 

implementation of workflow processes in the form of a runtime execution language or 

script for an associated process engine. This approach provides an effective means to 

deploy and execute processes within a homogeneous environment served by a particular 

process engine. However, to meet the needs within and across enterprises that may be using 

different process engines and languages a more abstract approach is needed to facilitate 

design, integration, execution and management of these processes many of which will be 

asynchronous by nature.  

Geoprocessing Workflow brings both terms together. It can be seen as an automation of a 

spatial process/model, in whole or part, during which information is passed from one 

distributed geoprocessing service to another according to a set of procedural rules using 

standardized interfaces.  

Geoprocessing Workflows integrate data and services in an interoperable way, where each 

part of the workflow is responsible for only a specific task, without being aware of the 

general purpose of the workflow. Due to the distributed nature of geographic data, 

Geoprocessing Workflows provide flexible means of processing highly distributed and 

complex data for a wide variety of uses.  

Workflow is applicable across all categories of fusion.  Workflow for Object/Feature 

Fusion was discussed in Section 9.2.6. 

Figure 14 shows an example – from PYXIS – of fusion workflow using OGC standards 

such as Web Processing. PYXIS advocates a strong focus on a standardized discrete global 

grid for this architecture.  The architecture in the figure can be deployed using the grid 

advocated by PYXIS along with many other data structures and types using an open 

standards approach that delays re-gridding.  Nonetheless, the figure portrays the functional 

architecture to be deployed for fusion workflow.

11.2.5 Grid and Cloud Computing 

Highly specialized geospatial applications based on large volumes of distributed data such 

as live sensor data streams at different scales combined with high resolution geospatial 

data, which have to be analyzed in real-time for risk management issues, require often the 

functionality of multiple processes. In such highly specialized large-scale geospatial 

applications, not every processing step can potentially be handled by a single processing 

entity (for example with the resources of a single computer). To improve the computational

performance of processing large amounts of dynamic geospatial data, Grid and Cloud 

computing provides appropriate tools21. 

OWS-6 demonstrated the use of grid computing in a web services environment using the 

OGC WPS as a gateway to the grid22.  In that deployment, WPS was used to access grid 

resources using standards from the Open Grid Forum. 

Cloud computing is a pay-per-use model for enabling convenient, on-demand network 

access to a shared pool of configurable and reliable computing resources (e.g., networks, 

servers, storage, applications, services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with 

minimal consumer management effort or service provider interaction. 

Several OGC members have deployed their software solutions with OGC interfaces in 

various Cloud providers.  FortiusOne highlighted in their response to the Fusion RFI (See 

Figure 15).

To be considered a “cloud” the offered service must be deployed on top of cloud 

infrastructure that enables the key characteristics stated above. 

11.2.6 Security-enabled Architecture for Fusion 

Realization of web services security architectures and mechanisms must be robust and 

mature to meet the challenges facing a fusion of rich sets of data or information from a

variety of disparate resources in order to improve one‟s capability to detect, identify, and 

characterize an entity for useful and timely action.  Web services security is founded on the 

following concepts24: 

Authentication: Who is accessing the resource? Verify that principals (humans or application 

components) are who they claim to be through appropriate proof of identity. Determine the identity 

or role of a party attempting to perform some action, such as accessing a resource or participating in 

a transaction. 

Authorization: What can they do? Grant permission for principals to access resources based upon access 

rights. Determine whether some party is allowed to perform a requested action or access particular 

resources. 

Integrity: Ensure that information is intact. Ensure that information is not changed in transit, either due 

to malicious intent or by accident. This may be information transmitted over a network, information 

stored in a database or file system, or information passed in a Web services message and processed 

by intermediaries. 

Non-repudiation: Verify the identity of authors using electronic signatures. Produce or verify an 

electronic signature for purposes such as approval, confirmation of receipt, acceptance or agreement. 

Confidentiality: Make content unreadable by unauthorized parties. Ensure that only legitimate parties 

may view content, even if other access control mechanisms are bypassed, and guarantee that 

exchanged information is protected against eavesdroppers. Confidentiality is generally associated 

with encryption technologies. 

Privacy: Limit access and use of individually identifiable information. Personally identifiable 

information is required by individuals and organizations to perform services for an individual. 

Ensuring the security of web services involves implementation of security frameworks 

based on use of authentication, authorization, confidentiality, and integrity mechanisms that 

include the following security standards. 

Confidentiality - XML Encryption as a mechanism to encrypt XML documents 

Integrity - XML Signature to provide a means to selectively sign XML data 

Authentication and Authorization – SAML, GeoXACML, XACML and resource-oriented approaches 

such as OpenID and OAuth 

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) - using XKMS and X.509 Certificates 

WS-Security - SOAP header extensions for end-to-end SOAP messaging security that supports message 

integrity and confidentiality.

11.4 Recommendations  

It is a core requirement that the various fusion processes will be performed within and 

across a net-centric environment, thus calling for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). 

Service in network-austere environments is less well understood and supported. The 

findings from this study will be discussed in terms of the following: 

 Use of OGC/ISO standards (CSW, WPS, WMS, WFS, WCS, metadata, etc.) 

 Semantics mediation of community vocabularies, taxonomies 

 Workflow driven by semantics 

 Role of human in the loop vs. automation 

 Grid and Cloud implementations 

These essentially represent crosscutting issues effecting most or all of the various types of 

fusion to be performed (sensor, feature, decision), and will each be discussed in turn.  



OGC 09-138 

56 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

11.4.1 Use of Open, Community IT Standards  

There is a veritable forest of encoding, processing, communications, and security standards 

from which to choose that are from at least a dozen international Standards Development 

Organizations (SDO). Of primary interest are open community standards. For core Internet 

communications and data exchange, the relevant SDOs include IEEE 

(http://www.ieee.org), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF,  http://www.ietf.org/), 

the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, http://www.w3.org), the Organization for 

Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS, http://www.oasis-open.org), 

and ISO TC211 (http://www.isotc211.org/). Additional SDO‟s cover narrower niches of 

technology standards, such as UncertML (http://www.uncertml.org).  

Regardless of any other SDOs‟ standards for SOA that may apply in a given context (e.g., 

from W3C, OASIS, IETF, etc.), it is important to factor in OGC/ISO geospatial encoding 

and web services standards. The OGC/ISO standards address mathematically complex 

issues having to do with proper encoding of geometric data and associated coordinate 

reference systems, as well as proper handling of the data structures throughout various 

types of spatial, topological, temporal, statistical, and other operations on the data. The 

relationships which have emerged between OGC and other IT-community SDOs respect 

and reflect this expertise, delegating to OGC the definition of geospatial and temporal 

interface specifications and styles of usage for the non-spatial communities.  

A good example of this is the OASIS standard, Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), used for 

emergency dispatch. This XML-based protocol includes a data entity for the location point 

and/or polygon affected by the particular emergency in a given message. In the current 

versions 1.0/1.2 the locational data is very simplistic. However, a new version 2.0 in 

development will allow extensions, such as to use a GML application schema for location 

information. OGC is now working on the GML application schema to be proposed to 

OASIS for use in all its location-dependent standards. OWS-7 may provide an ideal setting 

in which to exercise various implementations of the new CAP standard.  

Specific standards called out in the RFI responses include WFS, SOS, SPS, SWE Common, 

O&M, SensorML, Web Notification Service (WNS), GeoRSS, Catalogue Service (CSW) 

with ebRIM, ebXML Reg/Rep, KML, SOAP.  

11.4.2 Semantics mediation of community vocabularies, taxonomies 

It is an immutable condition that data fusion will involve disparate sources and forms of 

expression. While some consolidation of classifications can take place through community 

standards and best practices, the differences in perspective and requirements across any one 

or more communities of practice will inevitably bring about some number of conflicting 

terms and meanings in datasets. In some cases, the same term may be used with different 

meanings, while in others different terms may have the same or similar meaning. There will 

never be a single, overarching classification system on which all others are based or 

derived.  

Progress has been made in developing semantics mediation tools for simplifying user 

interfaces to multiple data sources with similar content but different labels. These tools 

have so far concentrated on “hard fusion” subject matter such as coding values for air and 

water quality variables, since that is more precise and easily automated. Further work is

needed in the area of semantics mediation for “soft fusion” applications that are more 

dependent on the user‟s subjective understanding.  

It is also important to stay aware of the limits of both automated and human-subjective 

processes, and avoid the trap of over-classification. Ontology creation and maintenance can 

become a seductive but endless process of ever-more precise definition of the entities of 

interest. As semantics development projects are carried out, the participants in these tasks 

should keep continual vigilance to develop vocabularies and taxonomies that strive to be 

simple yet elegant. This will help in achieving faster and more often correct mediation 

processing.    

11.4.3 Workflow driven by semantics 

To cope with the crush of huge and growing data volumes to be processed, it is important to 

incorporate human awareness and expert knowledge into workflow processes as much as 

possible. This could be in the form of enhanced context awareness governing choices 

available and properties of each choice in a workflow. A key objective is to improve the 

quality of any given workflow, while lowering its cost, and improving performance.  

Tradeoffs of regarding roles of human in the loop vs. full automation of workflow should 

be investigated.  

11.4.4 Grid and Cloud implementations for performance and access 

Both Grid and Cloud infrastructures (in the information technology perspective) may be 

useful approaches to coping with the growing large volumes and increasing sophistication 

of data processing. It was interesting to note that more of the RFI responses referred to 

cloud infrastructures than to grid infrastructures.  This may be partially due to the more 

recent entry of clouds in IT, but it is probably also due to the greater simplicity of access 

and usage for client applications of clouds.
