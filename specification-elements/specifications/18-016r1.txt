Revisions	to	Volume	1:	CDB	Core	Model	and	Physical	Data	Store	

Introductory	Clause	“Future	Work”	
Updated to reflect work done in CDB version 1.1 as well as new requirements identified in OGC 
Testbed 13. 

1.0.1	Corrigendum	changes	included	
All CDB 1.0.1 Corrigendum changes incorporated. See OGC document 17-064 Summary of Corrigendum 
Changes for CDB Volume1: Core. 

General	Change:	All	file	extensions	in	Requirements	are	now	generic	
All file specific extensions stated in requirements have been made generic. For example, CDB Volume 1 
Requirement formerly stated: 

The files from the GSModelGeometry and GSModelInteriorGeometry datasets SHALL have the following 
naming convention: LatLon_Dnnn_Snnn_Tnnn_LOD_Un_Rn_FeatureCode_FSC_MODL.flt. 

This Requirement now reads: 

The files from the GSModelGeometry and GSModelInteriorGeometry datasets SHALL have the following 
naming convention: LatLon_Dnnn_Snnn_Tnnn_LOD_Un_Rn_FeatureCode_FSC_MODL.<ext> 

Where <ext> is the correct file name extension for the data encoded in the file. There is also a footnote 
that specifies what the extension was in version 1.0 of the CDB standard. 

Clause	1.4.3	CDB	Metadata	
This clause was updated to: 

• Provide definitions for metadata, controlled vocabularies, and enumerations. These are in 
clauses 1.4.3.1, 1.4.3.2, and 1.4.3.3. 

• Insert a table that provides more detailed information on each of the files included in the 
metadata folder. 

Clause	1.4.4	CDB	Directory	File	Naming	and	Structure	
This clause is updated to: 

• Reflect the use of generic file extensions in all Requirements and the Abstract Test Suite rather 
than specific file extensions. 

• Reflect the addition of enumerations and controlled vocabularies as concepts in the standard. 

Clause	1.7.1.4	System	Hardware	Independence	
Slight re-wording to make the sentence grammatically correct. 



Clause	3.1.1	Metadata	Directory	
Reformatted to be more easily read and understood. 

Clause	3.1.1Metadata	Directory	
A new metadata file description for global metadata – including geospatial metadata -applicable to an 
entire CDB data store was added. This new metadata file description needs to be read in concert with 
the changes in clauses 1.4.3, 5.1, and specifically 5.1.6. 

Clause	3.4.2.4	Examples	
An example of the file path for all associated metadata is included. 

Clause	3.4.4.3	Examples	
An example of the file path for all associated metadata is included. 

Clause	3.4.4.4	Examples	
An example of the file path for all associated metadata is included. 

Clause	3.4.5.2	Examples	
An example of the file path for associated metadata is included. 

Clause	5.1	enhanced	to	include	discussion	of	Controlled	Vocabularies	
Clause 5.1 has additional wording explaining CDB use of metadata, enumerations and controlled 
vocabularies. This change resulted from the work in CDB 1.1 for metadata. Many elements in CDB 1.0 
that were referred to as metadata are actually enumerations and controlled vocabularies. 

Clause	5.1.1	Global	Metadata	
A new clause added that defines what is meant by Global Metadata in general for a CDB data store. 

Clause	5.1.2	Local	Metadata	
A new clause added that defines what is meant by Local Metadata for a CDB data store. 

Clause	5.1.8	(Formerly	Clause	5.1.6)	Version	Metadata	
Specification version definition enhanced to include both OGC and community versions of the standard. 

Addition of a mandatory <Metadata standard="metadata-standard-name"> element that specifies the 
metadata standard used for a CDB data store. This includes a list of metadata standards commonly used 
in the geospatial and simulation industries. This enumeration is governed by and agreed to by the OGC 
CDB Standards Working Group. Other metadata standards or profiles of standards may be added upon 
request and with proper justification. For backwards compatibility, the Metadata_standard element can 
be set to “NoMetadata”. 

Clause	5.1.12	Geospatial	Metadata	Guidance	
This is a new clause that provides general implementation guidance for encoding and storing metadata 
in a CDB data store. 



Clause	5.1.12.1	Suggested	Global	Geospatial	Metadata	Elements	
This is a new clause that provides guidance on which metadata elements should be included in the 
global metadata resource. 

Clause	5.1.12.2	Suggested	Local	Geospatial	Metadata	Elements	
This is a new clause that provides guidance on which metadata elements should be included in a local 
metadata resource. 

Clause	5.6	
Cross walked the CDB tiled grid concept with the OGC/ISO baseline, specifically the OGC Coverage 
Implementation Schema (CIS) September 2017. 

Clause	5.6.2.3.2	VSTI	Default	Read	Value	(Change	Request	490)	
Requirement 102 is against CDB client-devices and not the CDB data store itself.  This is an untestable 
requirement, and further, a client-device should be allowed to read and consume a CDB in any manner 
that it wishes.  There might well be good reasons to not follow those rules in a client-device, so the spec 
should not impose this. 

Therefore, this requirement was removed and replaced with informative guidance for client 
implementations. The related test 102 is removed from Annex A – Abstract Test Suite. 

New	Clause:	5.7.1.6.4	Network	Vector	Priority	
After CDB was submitted to the OGC, the CDB user community added a new sub-clause to clarify rules 
for network vector priority. This CDB user community approved clause is now incorporated in Volume 1 
of the OGC CDB standard, version 1.1. 

New	Clause:	5.7.1.9	Vector	Significant	Size	and	Spatial	Significance	Criteria	
After CDB was submitted to the OGC, the CDB user community added a new sub-clause to clarify rules 
for vector significant size and spatial significance. This CDB user community approved clause is now 
incorporated in Volume 1 of the OGC CDB standard, version 1.1. Clause 5.7.1.9 includes two sub-clauses: 
5.7.1.9.1 Vector Significant Size and 5.7.1.9.2 Levels of Detail and Spatial Significance Criteria. 

Annex	A:	Abstract	Test	Suite	
All tests that had specific file extensions, such as .shp or .flt, are now generic with a note as to what the 
extensions were in version of the CDB standard prior to version 1.1. 

Table	5-1	Component	Selectors	for	CDB	Controlled	Vocabularies	and	Metadata	
A new selector value “12” for global metadata was added. 

Table	5-9:	Component	Selectors	for	GTModel	Datasets	
Provide correct volume and section reference to GTModel descriptor definition. Please note, while this 
descriptor content is called metadata, this IS NOT the metadata as defined in Volume 1 clauses 5.1.1 and 
5.1.2. 



Figure	5-25.	Two	instances	of	code	65		
After verification with the reference document, the correct lines are: 
 
  - 64: Gable with Monitor 
  - 65: Reserved 
 
The reference document is Digest Part 4, ISO 15046-10 Profile, March 1999, Annex B, Attribute and 
Value Codes. 

Table	5-27	Use	of	“D”	has	two	meanings.	(Change	Request	471)	
There was recommendation to remove the use of "D" indicating a "Deprecated Attribution Schema" and 
keep just one use of "D" for "Dependent on another attribute". This recommendation was accepted and 
the change made to Table 5-27. 

Table	5-27	not	entirely	visible	(Change	Request	481)	
In version 1.0, Table 27 is not entirely visible (clipped at page edge). This comment was accepted and 
the change made to the table prior to insertion into Volume 1 Core. 

CDB_Attributes.xml	Schema	error	(Change	Request	482)	
In: CDB_Attributes.xml 
 
  No.:9 
  Attr short name:BOTY 
  Attr name: Boundary Type 
  Description: "...See table 5-29 for a list of accepted values..." 
 

The table 5-29 was corrected to be 5-19.

clarify rules for vector priority in the LoD/Tile structure. This CDB user community approved clause is 
now incorporated in Volume 7 of the OGC CDB standard, version 1.1.
