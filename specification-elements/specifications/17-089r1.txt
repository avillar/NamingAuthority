                                i. Abstract


The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic retrieval of geospatial data as “coverages.” Coverages are digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena, specifically spatio-temporal regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and general meshes.

This document specifies the WCS core. Every implementation of a WCS shall adhere to this standard. This standard defines core requirements. Extensions to the core define extensions to meet additional requirements, such as the response encoding. Additional extensions are required in order to completely specify a WCS for implementation.

This WCS 2.1 standard extends WCS 2.0 in a backwards compatible manner by accommodating coverages as per the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.1 in addition to CIS 1.0 coverages as addressed by WCS 2.0.

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

ogcdoc, OGC document, coverage, Web Coverage Service, grid, mesh

iii.          Preface

This document specifies the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) core requirements, which are mandatory for any implementation claiming to be conformant with WCS. The WCS standard is based on the Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS), OWS Common, and OGC Abstract Topic 6. WCS 2.1 extends WCS 2.0 (which establishes how to offer coverages as per CIS 1.0) so that 2.1 servers may additionally offer coverages as per CIS 1.1. Therefore, WCS 2.1 is backwards compatible with WCS 2.0. Any service passing the WCS 2.1 conformance tests will also pass the WCS 2.0 tests. Further, all WCS 2.x extensions remain applicable in the context of WCS 2.1.

Suggested additions, changes, and comments on this draft document are welcome and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message or by making suggested changes in an edited copy of this document

1.    Scope

This document specifies how a Web Coverage Service (WCS) offers multi-dimensional (usually spatio-temporal) coverage data for access over the Internet. This document relies on and extends WCS 2.0, which operates on coverages as per the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) 1.0, with support for coverages as per CIS 1.1.

All WCS 2.0 service extension standards remain applicable under WCS 2.1. However, in order to accommodate CIS 1.1 some extensions may need to be enhanced, leading to a minor version updates.

2.    Conformance

Standardization target are WCS 2.1 implementations (currently: servers).

This document establishes a single requirements class, core, http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.1/req/core with a single pertaining conformance class, core, with URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.1/conf /core. Requirements and conformance test URIs defined in this document are relative paths to be appended to http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.1/.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site[1].

In order to conform to this OGC®interface standard, a software implementation shall choose to implement:

a)     Any one of the conformance levels specified in Annex A (normative).

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

4.    Terms and Definitions

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r9], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

For the purposes of this document, all terms and definitions in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6 apply.

5.    Conventions

5.1    UML notation

Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagrams appearing in this standard are used as described in Sub-clause 5.2 of OGC Web Service Common [OGC 06-121r9]. Further, the following conventions hold.

	UML elements having a package name of “OWS Common” are those defined in the UML model of OWS Common [OGC 06-121r9].
	UML elements having a package name of GML are those defined in the UML model of GML [OGC 07-036].
	UML elements having a package name of “SWE Common” are those defined in the UML model of SWE Common [OGC 08-094].
	UML elements having a package name of CIS are those defined in the UML model of CIS 1.0 [OGC 09-146r2].

	UML data type Any is used here as an equivalent to XML’s xsd:any.


5.2    Data dictionary tables

The UML model data dictionary is specified herein in a series of tables. The contents of the columns in these tables are described in Sub-clause 5.5 of [OGC 06-121r9]. The contents of these data dictionary tables are normative, including any table footnotes.

For the reader’s convenience, table rows describing inherited components are shaded.

5.3    Namespace prefix conventions

The following namespaces are used in this document. The prefix abbreviations used constitute conventions, but are notnormative. The namespaces to which the prefixes refer are normative, however.

6.    WCS Data Model

A WCS server offers a – possibly empty – set of coverage objects, each of which can be either a CIS 1.0 coverage or a CIS 1.1 coverage.

7.    WCS Service Model

The WCS Core service model is identical to WCS 2.0, but extended with CIS 1.1 coverages in its offering (Figure 1). In particular, the requests syntax and semantics remain unchanged so that a WCS 2.1 server offers the services established in WCS Core 2.0 [OGC 09-110r4] on both CIS 1.0 [OGC 09-146r2] and CIS 1.1 [OGC 09-146r6] coverages. Syntax is added which allows differentiating between CIS 1.0 and CIS 1.1 structures as results.

NOTE 1    As per OGC Web Services, the functionality of extensions listed in the Capabilities is available on all coverages offered, both CIS 1.0 and 1.1.

NOTE 2    There is no formal requirement on the contents of this diagram because it will be a segue of the requirements on requests.

Extended behavior of WCS 2.1 over WCS 2.0 is described in the following clauses.

8.    WCS Core Operations

8.1    GetCapabilities operation

The WCS2.1 GetCapabilities request is identical to the definition provided in WCS 2.0.

The WCS 2.1 GetCapabilities response additionally reports CIS 1.1 coverages.

Requirement 1                 /req/core/getCapabilities-cis11:
The GetCapabilities request of a WCS 2.1 server shall handle CIS 1.0 [OGC 09-146r2] and CIS 1.1 [OGC 09-146r6] coverages identically.
 Dependency:http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.0/conf/core, 
 http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.0/conf/coverage, http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.1/conf/coverage

NOTE       Often a single implementation will support both WCS 2.0 and 2.1 requests. However, both will not necessarily return the same list of coverages offered: a GetCapabilities request against a WCS 2.0 server will only list CIS 1.0 coverages, but not list any CIS 1.1 coverages as these are unknown per definition of WCS 2.0 and cannot be retrieved through a WCS 2.0 DescribeCoverage or GetCoverage request – whereas under a WCS 2.1 regime, both CIS 1.0 and CIS 1.1 coverages will be listed, if any.

8.2    DescribeCoverage operation

The WCS 2.1 DescribeCapabilities request is identical to its definition in WCS 2.0.

The WCS 2.1 DescribeCoverage response is identical to WCS 2.0 for CIS 1.0 coverages; for CIS 1.1 coverages, the response structure is adjusted accordingly.

Requirement 2                 /req/core/describeCoverage-cis11:
The response to a successful DescribeCoveragerequest on a CIS 1.1 coverage [OGC 09-146r6] shallconsist of a CoverageDe­script­ions element as described in Figure 2 and Table 2.

Table 2 lists the structure of the CIS 1.1 enhanced subtype WCS 2.1::Cover­age­Desc­ript­ion. Depending on the coverage type requested the result will be a WCS 2.0 coverage description (for CIS 1.0 coverages) or a WCS 2.10 description (for CIS 1.1 coverages).

To keep response size moderate, a coverage description does not include any recursively nested cov­erages, nor position/value pairs. To still provide information about the domain extent, the coverage envelope is mandatory in this case.

Requirement 3                 /req/core/no-description-nesting:
The response to a successful DescribeCoveragerequest on a CIS 1.1 coverage [OGC 09-146r6] which contains a CIS 1.1::PartitionSetshallnot contain a CIS 1.1:: PartitionSet and shallcontain an envelope.

NOTE       The domain set description variants added in CIS 1.1 [OGC 09-146r6] allow for recursive coverage nestings through the PartitionSet component, which obviously should be copied into a coverage description (which intuitively is expected to be comparatively small in size). However, beware that the domain extent description still can be large – the domain set of a CIS 1.0::Referenceable­Grid­Coverage and a CIS 1.1::Displace­ment­Axis­Nest (“warped”) coverage (CIS 1.1 conformance class grid-irregular) may grow as big as the range set, and actually can exceed its size, in certain situations.

8.3    GetCoverage operation

The GetCoveragerequest is identical to its definition in WCS 2.0: coverages offered can be retrieved. However, more coverage types than in WCS 2.0 can be queried in WCS 2.1, as is detailed in the extended response definition below.

The WCS 2.1 GetCoverageresponse is extended over WCS 2.0 (supporting CIS 1.0 only) to allow CIS 1.1, the Referenceable Grid Coverage extension, and GML 3.3.

Requirement 4                 /req/core/getCoverage-cis11:
The contents of the response to a successful WCS 2.1 GetCoveragerequestshall be a con­crete subtype of either CIS 1.0::AbstractCoverage or CIS 1.1::Abstract­Cov­erage or GMLCOVRGRID 1.0:: Referenceable­Grid­Coverage or a GML 3.3 cov­erage type.
 Dependency:http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.0/conf/core, 
 http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.0/conf/coverage, http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.1/conf/coverage

NOTE       Currently, no translation between coverage types is defined so implementations should not be expected to perform any (although the specification does not exclude it); however, such functionality may be defined in future, e.g., through a bespoke WCS Extension.

8.4    Exceptions

Exceptions are the same as in WCS 2.0.




 



Annex : Conformance Class Abstract Test Suites (Normative) 

 

A.1     Conformance Test Class: core

The OGC URI identifier of this conformance class is:
 http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.1/conf/core.

Tests identifiers below are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.1/.

A.1.1   GetCapabilitieslists CIS 1.1 coverages

	
  Test id:

  	
  /conf/core/getCapabilities-cis11

  
	
  Test Purpose:

  	
  Requirement
  /req/core/getCapabilities-cis11:

  The GetCapabilities
  request of a WCS 2.1 server shall
  handle CIS 1.0 [OGC 09-146r2] and CIS 1.1 [OGC 09-146r6] coverages
  identically.

  Dependency: http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.0/conf/core,
  

  http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.0/conf/coverage, http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.1/conf/coverage

  
	
  Test method:

  	
  Provide at least one CIS 1.1 coverage on
  server under test. Send a GetCapabilities
  request to this server, check that the result lists all CIS 1.1 coverages
  inserted.

  



A.1.2   DescribeCoverageresponse structure for CIS 1.1 coverages

	
  Test id:

  	
  /conf/core/describeCoverage-cis11

  
	
  Test Purpose:

  	
  Requirement
  /req/core/describeCoverage-cis11:

  The response to a successful DescribeCoverage
  request on a CIS 1.1 coverage [OGC 09-146r6] shall consist of a CoverageDe­script­ions
  element as described in Figure 2 and
  Table 2.

  
	
  Test method:

  	
  Provide at least one CIS 1.1 coverage on
  the server under test. Send a DescribeCoverage
  request on these coverages to server under test, check the result con­sists of
  a structure as describ­ed in the requirement. Test passes if all individual
  tests pass.

  



A.1.3   DescribeCoverageresponse without CIS 1.1 partitionSet

	
  Test id:

  	
  /conf/core/describeCoverage-cis11-no-nesting

  
	
  Test Purpose:

  	
  Requirement
  /req/core/no-description-nesting:

  The response to a successful DescribeCoverage
  request on a CIS 1.1 coverage [OGC 09-146r6] which contains a CIS 1.1::PartitionSet
  shall not contain a CIS 1.1:: PartitionSet and
  shall contain an envelope.

  
	
  Test method:

  	
  Provide at least one CIS 1.1 coverage on
  the server under test which contains a partitionSet.
  Send a DescribeCoverage request on
  these coverages to server under test. Check that the results fulfil the
  requirement. Test passes if all individual tests pass.

  



A.1.4   GetCoverageresponse structure for CIS 1.1 coverages

	
  Test id:

  	
  /conf/core/getCoverage-cis11

  
	
  Test Purpose:

  	
  Requirement
  /req/core/getCoverage-cis11:

  The contents of the response to a successful WCS 2.1 GetCoverage
  request shall be a
  con­crete subtype of either CIS10::AbstractCoverage
  or CIS11::Abstract­Coverage.

  Dependency: http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.0/conf/core,
  

  http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.0/conf/coverage, http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.1/conf/coverage

  
	
  Test method:

  	
  Provide at least one CIS 1.1 coverage on
  the server under test. Send a GetCoverage
  request on these coverages to server under test, executing all WCS Core
  functionalities: complete download, trimming, slicing, format encoding. Check
  that the results of these operations are correct as per their specification
  in WCS 2.0. Test passes if all individual tests pass.
