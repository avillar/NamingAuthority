DATE:   5/28/2004 
CATEGORY:  Change Proposal 

1. Background 
This change proposal is an outcome of the Common Architecture thread of the OpenGIS 
Web Service 2 initiative. The aim is to add support for a standard WSDL description of 
the WMS interface in version 1.3.1. 

2. References 
[1] . 03-109r1, Web Map Server Interface, 01-2004. 

3. Proposal 
 
Change Request 1: Add a normative WSDL description as a Annex to the WMS 
specification. 
 
3.1.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
Annex shall include WSDL definition and schema folder shall include 
wms_abstract.wsdl and wms.wsdl, as well as the common schemas as provided by OWS 
2 Common Architecture work. 
 
3.1.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  
Add WSDL description as a normative part to the specification. 
 
3.1.3 Reason for change: 
To provide the normative definition of the WSDL description of the WMS interface to be 
used each time a WMS is describe using this language.

3.1.4 Summary of change: 
Add a WSDL description of WMS as an Annex to the document and provide the 
electronic description integrated with the existing XSD description. OWS 2 Common 
Architecture has published such integrated schemas and WSDL documents. 
 
3.1.5 Consequences of the change 
WMS implementation shall use this WSDL definition to describe their WMS instances 
ensuring a better interoperability of the WMS interface while using the commonly used 
WSDL technology. 
 
3.1.6 Consequences if not approved 
Different WMS provide might define different way to describe WMS interface using 
WSDL reducing the interoperability of the interface. 
 
 

_________________________________ 
 
Change Request 2: Add a clear normative clause that state WSDL definition shall be 
used by all service providers that make a WSDL description available. 
 
3.2.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
??? 
 
3.2.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  
Add a normative clause that explain the intended use of the WSDL. 
 
3.2.3 Reason for change: 
It is important to explain the intended use of the normative WSDL description to avoid 
misused. 
 
3.2.4 Summary of change: 
Add a normative clause saying: 
“All WMS service described using a WSDL document shall use the standard WSDL as 
described in Annex X. It is not required to import the document provided by the 
OpenGIS but it is required to use exactly the same definition as in the provided WSDL. ” 
 
3.2.5 Consequences of the change 
WMS instances describe using WSDL will use the standard WSDL, improving 
interoperability.

3.2.6 Consequences if not approved 
Different WMS providers might define different way to describe WMS interface using 
WSDL reducing the interoperability of the interface. 
 
Change Request 3: Include an optional link from the Capabilities to the WSDL. 
 
3.3.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
??? 
 
3.3.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  
This optional link will ease discovery and use of WSDL description. 
 
3.3.3 Reason for change: 
The access to a WSDL description may facilitate the binding phase of Web Service 
access. 
 
3.3.4 Summary of change: 
Add an element in the Capabilities document that refers to the WSDL. 
 
3.3.5 Consequences of the change 
A link to the WSDL description will be available in the Capabilities document. 
 
3.3.6 Consequences if not approved 
There will be no way the advertise in the Capabilities that a service is described by a 
WSDL document. 
 
Change Request 4: Include the description of the SOAP binding. 
 
3.4.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
Adding SOAP support require creation of a new section. Proposal is to add a section 
6.3.5 SOAP that is presented here under. 
 
6.3.5 SOAP 
A Web Map Service may support the “SOAP” protocol. 
The implementation of the SOAP protocol is using document/literal encoding and the 
messages are the one defined in the Annex E of this document. 
There is two step in supporting SOAP, 

§ Adding definition of the SOAP binding to the WSDL description of the service 
§ Adding support for SOAP document/literal envelope

6.3.5.2 Declaring SOAP support in Capabilities 
SOAP support shall be declared in the Capabilities of the services. This will allow usage 
of SOAP independently of WSDL. 
If SOAP is supported, the services shall advertise

6.3.5.3 SOAP document/literal envelope 
A Web Map Service that support SOAP binding shall accept document/literal SOAP 
messages which contains a message as defined in the XML encoding for Web Map 
Service. It is not required for the Web Map Service to support any other feature or 
extension of the SOAP protocol.

If the result of the operation is an XML document, it shall be included in a SOAP 
envelope as well,

If the result is a Binary, the content of the Body is not specified and the binary is attached 
to the SOAP message using SOAP with attachement [SOAP-Attachement].

3.4.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  
This change aims to add support for SOAP document/literal binding. 
 



OpenGIS Project Document 04-xxx 3/21/2003 Page 8 

3.4.3 Reason for change: 
The W3C standard way of doing web services is WSDL/SOAP/UDDI. Adding SOAP 
support will increase the potential user base of this specification. 
 
3.4.4 Summary of change: 
This change add support for SOAP. It requires the XML encoding of WMS request to be 
included in the specification. 
 
3.4.5 Consequences of the change 
The WMS interface will support SOAP binding. 
 
3.4.6 Consequences if not approved 
The industry standard for web services is WSDL/SOAP/UDDI, leaving the WMS without 
support for these is a thread for its mid-term adoption.
