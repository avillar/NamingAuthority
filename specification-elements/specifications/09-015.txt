OWS-6 Testbed 
 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver Engineering 
Reports and Chnage Requests into the OGC Specification Program, where they are 
formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of 
technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing interoperability problems 
posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include 
test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - 
all designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC 
standards. 
 
In April 2008, the OGC issued a call for sponsors for an OGC Web Services, Phase 6 (OWS-
6) Testbed activity. The activity completed in June 2009. There is a series of on-line 
demonstrations available here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/pub/www/ows6/index.html  
The OWS-6 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommended to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-6 initiative be organized around 
the following threads:  
 

1. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)  
 
2. Geo Processing Workflow (GPW)  
 
3. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM)  
 
4. Decision Support Services (DSS)  
 
5. Compliance Testing (CITE)  

 
The OWS-6 sponsoring organizations were:  
 

• U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)  
 

• Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD)  
 

• GeoConnections - Natural Resources Canada

4.2 Skeleton XML schemas 

This document defines data types in XML Schema.  A “skeleton” schema is one in which 
all comments and superfluous type definitions have been removed.  The skeleton 
schemas included in the narrative are informative and the XML-Schema files distributed 
with this document are normative. 

4.3 Narrative verb tenses 

This document describes changes made for the proposed new design.  Verb tenses are 
used saying that certain changes “have been” or that a change “is” made rather than 
saying that certain changes “should be” made to make this document easier to read.  
However, this document is only a proposal. 

5 Styled layer descriptor overview 

This OGC™ document reports the results achieved in the Decision Support Services 
(DSS) subtask of the OWS-6 testbed initiative as it relates to the extension of the OGC 
Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) symbology format for improved capability and 
harmonization with ISO 19117 symbology, International Hydrographic Organization S-
52 symbology, USGS Topomap symbology, and Homeland Security Emergency 
Management symbology. 

This report details changes made to the SLD design at the map, layer, and style levels. 

6 Styled layer descriptor 

StyledLayerDescriptor has been updated to the following skeleton XML Schema: 

<xsd:element name="StyledLayerDescriptor"> 
 <xsd:complexType> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Version"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Name" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Description" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="sld:UseSLDLibrary" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="sld:Layer" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> 
  </xsd:sequence> 
 </xsd:complexType> 
</xsd:element> 



OGC 09-015 

Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 5
 

The version attribute has been changed into an Version element and its value is “1.1.20”.  
This is discussed with the Symbology Encoding Engineering Report [OGC 09-016] 
common elements. 

7 Layer 

The SLD Layer encoding has been updated to the following skeleton XML schema: 

<xsd:element name="Layer"> 
 <xsd:complexType> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Name" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Description" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:choice minOccurs="0"> 
    <xsd:element ref="sld:ExternalDataSource"/> 
    <xsd:element ref="sld:InlineFeatureCollection"/> 
   </xsd:choice> 
   <xsd:choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
    <xsd:element ref="sld:NamedStyle"/> 
    <xsd:element ref="sld:UserStyle"/> 
   </xsd:choice> 
  </xsd:sequence> 
 </xsd:complexType> 
</xsd:element> 

7.1 Layer element 

The SLD 1.1.0 NamedLayer and UserLayer elements have been amalgamated and 
simplified to only identify the source of feature or coverage data and act as a container 
for the styling sub-elements.  The SLD 1.1.0 design is over-complicated and redundant. 

Amalgamating the existing layer elements produces no ambiguity and provides extra 
functionality.  The main distinction between a NamedLayer and a UserLayer is that a 
UserLayer can reference an external data source such as a WFS and that a UserLayer 
can reference only UserStyles, not NamedStyles. 

As CubeWerx has refined its internal structures that represent SLD information, we have 
found that it is very natural to represent both NamedLayers and UserLayers using 
exactly the same structure; the only distinction is that a named layer does not have all of 
its information filled in at SLD-parsing time; the fields are set to “unresolved” values.  
The missing information is resolved when processing is needed.  In the case of layers, the 
only missing information is the data source.  SLD defines missing sources to refer to the 
local or default data source. 

Additional functionality can be realized by allowing user-defined layers to refer to a 
named style in the case that the user-defined layer refers to a remote WMS or WMTS. 

7.2 External data source 

ExternalDataSource has the following skeleton XML schema: 



OGC 09-015 

6 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.
 

<xsd:element name="ExternalDataSource"> 
 <xsd:complexType> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="sld:DataSourceType"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:OnlineResource"/> 
  </xsd:sequence> 
 </xsd:complexType> 
</xsd:element> 

The SLD 1.1.0 RemoteOWS element has an overly specific name.  At CubeWerx, we 
use this mechanism to draw data from any kind of data source, such as a local Shapefile, 
which is neither “remote” nor an OGC Web Service.  This element has been changed to 
the more generic name ExternalDataSource.  The term “external” is also used in SE in 
ExternalGraphic in to refer to a graphic resource that is in an external format to the SE 
Standard. 

DataSourceType has the following skeleton XML schema: 

<xsd:element name="DataSourceType" type="xsd:string"/> 

The SLD 1.1.0 RemoteOWS element included a Service sub-element that identified the 
remote-OWS type.  This has been changed to the more generic name DataSourceType. 

Also, the SLD 1.1.0 Service element had the specific enumerated values of “WFS” and 
“WCS”.  The OGC service types of “WMS” and “WMTS” should be added to allow the 
additional functionality of cascading maps from remote WMS and WMTS services.  
Keep in mind that SLDs are useful outside of WMSes.  For instance, it could be used as a 
map definition within a client application.  The client will be directed to draw the map 
from various sources, perhaps including WMSes. 

This mechanism could also be used for any number of additional source formats, though 
no canonical names are defined for them.  The XML Schema type has been changed to 
use a generic xsd:string type to keep it open. 

7.3 Inline feature collection 

InlineFeatureCollection has the following skeleton XML schema: 

<xsd:element name="InlineFeatureCollection"> 
 <xsd:complexType> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="gml:FeatureCollection"/> 
  </xsd:sequence> 
 </xsd:complexType> 
</xsd:element> 

The SLD 1.1.0 InlineFeature element was misnamed.  It allowed inline GML feature 
collections instead of just a single feature, so it has been renamed to 
InlineFeatureCollection. 



OGC 09-015 

Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 7
 

The InlineFeature element also included an unbounded number of GML feature 
collections.  This is both unnecessary and awkward.  It is unnecessary since a GML 
feature collection may include any number of features of any type, so no benefit is 
obtained from allowing more than one GML feature collection to be present.  It is 
awkward since GML documents and WFS responses include exactly one GML feature 
collection, so implementations will be organized to process a single GML feature 
collection as a complete data store; requiring them to process multiple GML features 
collections would require new functionality.  The InlineFeatureCollection element 
includes exactly one GML feature collection. 

7.4 Layer feature constraints and layer coverage constraints 

The SLD 1.1.0 LayerFeatureConstraints and LayerCoverageConstraints elements 
have been removed.  The layer constraints are redundant with respect to the necessary 
filtering capabilities of the Rule element in Symbology Encoding.  The capability was 
originally included in SLD because one participant asked for it, but it is unclear if the 
capability was ever used and the participant is no longer active in OGC. 

One could argue that these constraints allow one to define precisely which features and/or 
coverage elements are present in a layer; however, defining the data contents of abstract 
feature agglomerations is not the purpose of SLD.  Layers exist only to serve as a 
convenient user-selection package for drawing maps. 

One could also argue that the constraints make it more convenient for a client to request a 
custom map in an environment that uses a catalog of FeatureTypeStyles.  I.e., one could 
construct a StyledLayerDescriptor that references predefined FeatureTypeStyles but 
where additional feature constraints are provided in the Layer level using the 
LayerFeatureConstraint element.  This allows the cataloged feature styles to be used 
as-is, but this use case does not justify the addition implementation burden on all 
implementers to support it. 

If the client wants more complicated functionality, then it should take on the burden itself 
by fetching the FeatureTypeStyle definitions from the catalog and altering the contained 
Rules as needed to achieve the additional feature-selection constraints.  This way, only 
the clients that need this additional functionality end up paying for it. 

8 User style 

The UserStyle element has the following skeleton XML Schema: 

<xsd:element name="UserStyle"> 
 <xsd:complexType> 
  <xsd:sequence> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Name" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="se:Description" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:element ref="sld:IsDefault" minOccurs="0"/> 
   <xsd:choice maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
    <xsd:element ref="se:FeatureTypeStyle"/> 
    <xsd:element ref="se:FeatureTypeStyleReference"/> 



OGC 09-015 

8 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.
 

    <xsd:element ref="se:CoverageStyle"/> 
    <xsd:element ref="se:CoverageStyleReference"/> 
   </xsd:choice> 
  </xsd:sequence> 
 </xsd:complexType> 
</xsd:element> 
<xsd:element name="IsDefault" type="xsd:boolean"/> 

An SLD 1.1.0 UserStyle could contain a mix of one or more FeatureTypeStyle, 
CoverageStyle, or OnlineResource elements.  The use of a “naked” OnlineResource 
element here is problematic in that neither the user nor the SLD processor can know 
which type of style is being included without fetching it.  In general, naked 
OnlineResouce elements should be replaced by special reference elements to be explicit 
about what is being included. 

The new SE design adds the FeatureTypeStyleReference and CoverageStyleReference 
elements that are made use of here.
