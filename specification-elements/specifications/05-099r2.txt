Foreword


This document specifies a subset profile of the existing OGC Implementation Specification for the Geometry Markup Language (GML) version 3.1.1 [OGC 03-105r1 and 04-093r4], and does not modify it. This is a GML profile as specified in Subclause 22 of [OGC 03-105r1]. This document does not replace any existing OGC document.

This document includes one normative annex: Annex A.


Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The OGC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.


Introduction


This document specifies a GML profile for XML encoding of simple dictionaries. This XML schema is a profile of the OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.1.1. These “simple” dictionaries do not allow including remote resources within the dictionary.


GML 3.1.1 simple dictionary profile

1 Scope


This GML 3.1.1 profile is defined for XML encoding of simple dictionaries. These “simple” dictionaries do not allow including remote resources within the dictionary. This profile supports the following concrete XML elements:


a) Dictionary


b) Definition


c) dictionaryEntry 

d) “id”

e) “name”

f) "description"

This profile does not support encoding of the other concrete elements defined in GML 3.1.1.

2 Compliance

All dictionaries encoded using this profile shall produce XML documents that are fully compliant with the normative XML Schema Documents associated with this specification, named: 


a) gmlSimpleDictionaryProfile.xsd


b) basicTypes.xsd


c) dictionary.xsd


d) gmlBase.xsd


Except for gmlSimpleDictionaryProfile.xsd, all these XML Schema Documents contain the subset of the corresponding GML 3.1.1 document that is needed by this GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary profile. This was done to facilitate checking that this profile is a strict subset of GML 3.1.1. This also facilitates comparing each document with the original, to determine which elements, attributes, and types were retained, and which were removed.


XML documents compliant with this profile shall import the gmlSimpleDictionaryProfile.xsd XML Schema Document schema, which will be available following approval of this document at http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/Profiles/SimpleDictionary/1.0.0/.


More specifically, compliance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative).

3 Normative references


The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this document. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies.

6 Simple dictionary profile

Background


GML 3.1.1 includes an XML Schema Document for encoding dictionaries of definitions, named dictionary.xsd. That XML Schema Document uses only parts of three other GML 3.1.1 documents, named


a) gmlBase.xsd 


b) basicTypes.xsd

c) xlinks.xsd

However, this set of four XML Schema Documents supports many abilities that are rarely used for encoding dictionaries. Therefore, a “simple dictionary” profile of this part of GML 3.1.1 is significantly simpler and thus easier to understand and use.


EXAMPLES 
Simple dictionaries that could use this profile are specified in several existing OGC documents, including in Recommendation Paper [OGC 05-010] “URNs of definitions in ogc namespace”. In that document, these dictionaries are axisDirection.xml, derivedCRSType.xml, pixelInCell.xml, rangeMeaning, and verticalDatumType.xml.


This profile was produced by retaining only those parts of the four GML 3.1.1 XML Schema Documents mentioned above that are useful for recording “simple” dictionaries. All other parts were removed.

Overview


This GML 3.1.1 profile is defined for encoding simple dictionaries of definitions. This GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary profile retains only the following XML elements used by simple dictionaries:


g) Dictionary, Definition, and dictionaryEntry in dictionary.xsd


h) _Object, _GML, “id”, “name”, and "description" in gmlBase.xsd

In addition to the above listed XML elements, the types needed to support those were also retained. Essentially all other parts were removed, including all deprecated parts.

This GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary Profile removes optional and alternative contents elements and attributes from the above-listed XML elements and the corresponding types, when these options and alternatives are rarely used in dictionaries. In addition to removing all deprecated parts, the removed contents elements and attributes include:


a) metaDataProperty, from StandardObjectProperties in gmlBase.xsd


b) indirectEntry, from Dictionary in dictionary.xsd


c) AssociationAttributeGroup, from DictionaryEntryType in dictionary.xsd


7 XML schema documents


This GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary Profile is specified in the four normative XML Schema Documents included in the zip file with this text document, which are named:


a) gmlSimpleDictionaryProfile.xsd, which “includes” the following three documents


b) basicTypes.xsd


c) dictionary.xsd


d) gmlBase.xsd


All these XML Schema Documents contain documentation of the meaning of each element and attribute, and this documentation shall be considered normative as specified in Subclause 11.6.3 of [OGC 05-008].


After OGC acceptance of Version 1.0.0 of this specification, all of these XML Schema Documents will also be posted online at the URL http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/Profiles/SimpleDictionary/1.0.0. In the event of a discrepancy between the bundled and online versions of the XML Schema Documents, the online files shall be considered authoritative.


In addition to the normative XML Schema Documents listed above, six example XML documents using this profile are included in the zip file with this text document. Five of those examples are essentially identical to the dictionaries included in Recommendation Paper [OGC 05-010] “URNs of definitions in ogc namespace”.

6 Simple dictionary profile 


6.1 Background 


GML 3.1.1 includes an XML Schema Document for encoding dictionaries of definitions, 
named dictionary.xsd. That XML Schema Document uses only parts of three other GML 
3.1.1 documents, named 


a) gmlBase.xsd  
b) basicTypes.xsd 
c) xlinks.xsd 


However, this set of four XML Schema Documents supports many abilities that are rarely 
used for encoding dictionaries. Therefore, a “simple dictionary” profile of this part of 
GML 3.1.1 is significantly simpler and thus easier to understand and use. 


EXAMPLES  Simple dictionaries that could use this profile are specified in several existing OGC documents, 
including in Recommendation Paper [OGC 05-010] “URNs of definitions in ogc namespace”. In that document, these 
dictionaries are axisDirection.xml, derivedCRSType.xml, pixelInCell.xml, rangeMeaning, and verticalDatumType.xml. 


This profile was produced by retaining only those parts of the four GML 3.1.1 XML 
Schema Documents mentioned above that are useful for recording “simple” dictionaries. 
All other parts were removed. 


6.2 Overview 


This GML 3.1.1 profile is defined for encoding simple dictionaries of definitions. This 
GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary profile retains only the following XML elements used by 
simple dictionaries: 


g) Dictionary, Definition, and dictionaryEntry in dictionary.xsd 


h) _Object, _GML, “id”, “name”, and "description" in gmlBase.xsd 







OGC 05-099r2 


4 Copyright © 2005 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


In addition to the above listed XML elements, the types needed to support those were 
also retained. Essentially all other parts were removed, including all deprecated parts. 


This GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary Profile removes optional and alternative contents 
elements and attributes from the above-listed XML elements and the corresponding 
types, when these options and alternatives are rarely used in dictionaries. In addition to 
removing all deprecated parts, the removed contents elements and attributes include: 


a) metaDataProperty, from StandardObjectProperties in gmlBase.xsd 


b) indirectEntry, from Dictionary in dictionary.xsd 


c) AssociationAttributeGroup, from DictionaryEntryType in dictionary.xsd 


7 XML schema documents 
This GML 3.1.1 Simple Dictionary Profile is specified in the four normative XML 
Schema Documents included in the zip file with this text document, which are named: 


a) gmlSimpleDictionaryProfile.xsd, which “includes” the following three documents 
b) basicTypes.xsd 
c) dictionary.xsd 
d) gmlBase.xsd 


All these XML Schema Documents contain documentation of the meaning of each 
element and attribute, and this documentation shall be considered normative as specified 
in Subclause 11.6.3 of [OGC 05-008]. 


After OGC acceptance of Version 1.0.0 of this specification, all of these XML Schema 
Documents will also be posted online at the URL 
http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/Profiles/SimpleDictionary/1.0.0. In the event of a 
discrepancy between the bundled and online versions of the XML Schema Documents, 
the online files shall be considered authoritative. 


In addition to the normative XML Schema Documents listed above, six example XML 
documents using this profile are included in the zip file with this text document. Five of 
those examples are essentially identical to the dictionaries included in Recommendation 
Paper [OGC 05-010] “URNs of definitions in ogc namespace”.

			 A definition, which can be included in or referenced by a dictionary. In this extended type, the inherited "description" optional element can hold the definition whenever only text is needed. The inherited "name" elements can provide one or more brief terms for which this is the definition. The inherited "metaDataProperty" elements can be used to reference or include more information about this definition.

In this restricted type, the inherited optional "description" element can be used for a description of this dictionary. The inherited optional "name" element can be used for the name(s) of this dictionary. The inherited "metaDataProperty" elements can be used to reference or contain more information about this dictionary. The inherited required gml:id attribute allows the dictionary to be referenced using this handle. 
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 
							 
								 An entry in this dictionary. The content of an entry can itself be a lower level dictionary or definition collection. This element follows the standard GML property model, so the value may be provided directly or by reference. Note that if the value is provided by reference, this definition does not carry a handle (gml:id) in this context, so does not allow external references to this specific entry in this context. When used in this way the referenced definition will usually be in a dictionary in the same XML document. 
							
						
					
				
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 An entry in a dictionary of definitions. An instance of this type contains one definition object.

			 The zero point of the vertical axis is defined by a surface that has meaning for the purpose which the associated vertical measurements are used for. For hydrographic charts, this is often a predicted nominal sea surface (i.e., without waves or other wind and current effects) that occurs at low tide. 
			 urn:ogc:def:pixelInCell:OGC:1.0:depth
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Atmospheric pressure is the basis for the definition of the origin of the associated vertical coordinate system axis. 
			 urn:ogc:def:pixelInCell:OGC:1.0:barometric
		
	
	 
		
		 
			 In some cases, e.g. oil exploration and production, a geological feature, such as the top or bottom of a geologically identifiable and meaningful subsurface layer, is used as a vertical datum. Other variations to the above three vertical datum types may exist and are all included in this type.

			 This abstract element is the head of a substitutionGroup hierararchy which may contain either simpleContent or complexContent elements.  It is used to assert the model position of "class" elements declared in other GML schemas.
		
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 Global element which acts as the head of a substitution group that may include any element which is a GML feature, object, geometry or complex value
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 This content model group makes it easier to construct types that  derive from AbstractGMLType and its descendents "by restriction".  A reference to the group saves having to enumerate the standard object properties.
		
		 
			 
			 
				 
					 Multiple names may be provided.  These will often be distinguished by being assigned by different authorities, as indicated by the value of the codeSpace attribute.  In an instance document there will usually only be one name per authority.
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 All complexContent GML elements are directly or indirectly derived from this abstract supertype to establish a hierarchy of GML types that may be distinguished from other XML types by their ancestry. Elements in this hierarchy may have an ID and are thus referenceable.
		
		 
			 
		
		 
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 Database handle for the object.  It is of XML type ID, so is constrained to be unique in the XML document within which it occurs.  An external identifier for the object in the form of a URI may be constructed using standard XML and XPointer methods.  This is done by concatenating the URI for the document, a fragment separator, and the value of the id attribute.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Label for the object, normally a descriptive name. An object may have several names, typically assigned by different authorities.  The authority for a name is indicated by the value of its (optional) codeSpace attribute.  The name may or may not be unique, as determined by the rules of the organization responsible for the codeSpace.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Contains a simple text description of the object.
			 Restricted to only allow a text string, as done in GML 3.2.
