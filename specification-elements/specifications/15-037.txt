Common Operating Picture: Recommendations

Abstract 
 

Responding to an oil spill requires access to and understanding of many types of 
information. Effective, coordinated operations for the response are based on a shared, 
common picture of the situation. Interoperability provides shared situational awareness of 
the crisis and the response activities. What is needed is a common picture of reality for 
different organizations that have different views of the spill so that they all can deal with it 
collectively. 

Recent oil spills have provided lessons learned and recommendations on forming a 
Common Operating Picture for oil spill response. Through a joint project, industry is 
responding to the call, moving from recommendations to reusable best practices supported 
by open standards that can be deployed quickly in any region of the globe. 

This architecture report is part of The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers and 
IPIECA Oil Spill Response - Joint Industry Project (IOGP–IPIECA OSR-JIP) to produce a 
recommended practice for GIS/mapping in support of oil spill response and for the use of 
GIS technology and geospatial information in forming a “Common Operating Picture” to 
support management of the response.  

Interoperability seems to be at first a technical topic, but in fact, it is about organization. 
Interoperability seems to be about the integration of information. What it’s really about is the 
coordination of organizational behavior. The Oil Spill Response Common Operating Picture 
(OSR COP) project seeks to facilitate the coordination of organizational response to any oil 
spill in the future.

Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

1 

Introduction 
Scope of this report 
This report provides an architecture for creating a Common Operating Picture (COP) for use 
during a response to an oil spill. This report provides recommended practice for the 
implementation of an effective COP and the requisite data management by the response 
community. 

The report was prepared as part of a project to assess the current state of standards and 
implementations that could support recommendations regarding a COP for use during an oil 
spill response (OSR). It has been compiled after a Request for Information (RFI) process 
based on an initial document developed by the organizations mentioned in Section 1.3, 
followed by two industry workshops (in Houston and in London) where oil & gas companies, 
vendors and suppliers, academia, and regulators participated and provided valuable 
contributions, which were taken into account when developing this version 1 of the 
Recommended Practice.  

Future versions of this Recommended Practice are expected after further work is done at an 
industry level to develop common data models/schema and standards, to support a more 
effective implementation of a COP. 

 
Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project  
The April 2010 Gulf of Mexico (Macondo/Deepwater Horizon) oil spill incident, and the 
Montara incident in Australia which preceded it, have had far-reaching consequences in 
prompting the re-examination by industry not only of operational aspects of offshore 
operations, but also of an operator’s ability to respond in the event of an oil spill incident or 
well blowout (Figure 1). 

In response to the foregoing, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) 
formed the Global Industry Response Group (GIRG), tasked with identifying learning 
opportunities both on causation and in respect of the response to the incident. Nineteen 
recommendations were identified and these are being addressed via a three-year Oil Spill 
Response - Joint Industry Project (OSR-JIP) funded by oil industry members1.

The OSR-JIP has initiated discreet projects or provided support to projects initiated by other 
trade associations in the nineteen subject areas resulting from the IOGP GIRG 
recommendations. The OSR-JIP is managed by IPIECA on behalf of IOGP in recognition of 
its long-standing experience with oil spill response matters. 

The OSR-JIP is composed of several work streams. This project forms part of JIP 8, 10, 11, 
& 16: Surveillance, Modelling & Visualization and is entitled Work Package 5 (WP5) - 
GIS/Mapping and Common Operating Picture.  

The aim for WP5 was to produce a recommended practice for the use of GIS and mapping 
in support of oil spill response and for the use of GIS technology and geo-information in 
forming a “Common Operating Picture” for management of the response.  

WP5 should identify: 

• What data needs to be available? 
• Where does it come from? 
• What format should it be in, and to what spatial accuracy? 
• How should it be delivered, and to whom? 
• How should it be archived and preserved. 

In addition, the outputs of WP5 are to align with the Incident Command System (ICS) 
model.

Organizations preparing this report 
The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP)2 is a unique global forum in 
which members identify and share best practices to achieve improvements in every aspect 
of health, safety, the environment, security, social responsibility, engineering and operations. 
IOGP encompasses most of the world's leading publicly traded, private and state-owned oil 
& gas companies, industry associations and major upstream service companies. IOGP 
members produce more than half the world's oil and about one third of its gas. 

IPIECA3 is the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. 
IPIECA was formed in 1974 following the launch of the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP). IPIECA is the only global association involving both the upstream and 
downstream oil and gas industry on environmental and social issues. IPIECA’s membership 
covers over half of the world’s oil production. IPIECA is the industry’s principal channel of 
communication with the United Nations. When IPIECA was set up in 1974 the acronym 
stood for the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association. In 
2009, recognizing that this no longer accurately reflected the breadth and scope of the 
association’s work, IPIECA stopped using the full title. The association is now known as 
IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues. 

Resource Data, Inc.4 (RDI) has been supporting the oil & gas industry with information 
technology for spill response since 1989. RDI brings unparalleled experience to oil spill 
response, leading the geographic information system (GIS) and database teams for the 
Exxon-Valdez spill and more recently the GIS response team in the Macondo/Deepwater 
Horizon spill. RDI has developed numerous spill response data systems, participated in 
multiple drills, and developed risk analysis systems for major pipeline networks. Our depth 
and breadth of expertise in spill preparedness and response uniquely positions RDI to assist 
in the development of a COP for the oil & gas industry.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)5 is an international consortium of more than 480 
companies, government agencies, research organizations, and universities participating in a 
consensus process to develop publicly available geospatial standards. OGC standards 
support interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the web, wireless and location-based 
services, and mainstream IT. OGC standards empower technology developers to make 
geospatial information and services accessible and useful with any application that needs to 
be geospatially enabled. 

 
Architecture viewpoints used in this document 
This report provides a technical description of a COP for oil spill response using an 
architecture perspective. The organization of this technical description is based on ISO/IEC 
10746, Information Technology — Open Distributed Processing — Reference Model. RM-
ODP defines viewpoints that separate the various concerns when developing an information 
system architecture.  

• Section 2 of the report provides an Enterprise Viewpoint, including a definition of a 
COP, the target audience (Users) and stakeholders, and example Use Case scenarios. 

• Section 3 provides an Information Viewpoint, outlining the specific information and 
data that is delivered through the COP, and the basic governing principles. 

• Section 4 outlines the computational Services Viewpoint, including interfaces and 
workflows pertinent to a COP using a service oriented architecture. 

• Section 5 provides a Deployment Viewpoint, identifying the key types of components 
required to support the deployment, management and integration of the services and 
data.

COP Enterprise Viewpoint 
Observations about Deepwater Horizon  
Accurate, timely, and geo-referenced information is vital to operational and strategic 
decision-making. The Deepwater Horizon incident created an unprecedented need for 
information on a real-time basis. Barriers to synchronized and total domain awareness 
during the Deepwater Horizon incident included: 

• Lack of agreement on what data needed to be tracked and transmitted; 
• Vast geography of the response area of operations; 
• Lack of availability of appropriate interoperable communications technology; 
• Limited ability to push real-time data, both vertically and laterally, throughout the 

response organization; 
• Different computing standards. 

The incompatibility of proprietary databases and software used by the private sector 
appeared to be a hindrance to developing a universal COP for the response organization. 
Integrating data from multiple restricted sources slowed the development of a complete and 
an accurate COP. 

The demand for information within Deepwater Horizon however drove an evolution of 
knowledge management and the response eventually established a strong COP, which 
provided for more effective communication throughout the response organization. An 
efficient information flow that met the needs of both the response organization and senior 
officials was also established, however there remained significant scope for improvement. 

Many of those interviewed specifically stated that the National Incident Management 
System/Incident Command System (ICS) worked as intended. Because NIMS/ICS is 
scalable, adaptive, and dynamic, responders were able to tailor the response organization 
according to need. The ‘Deepwater Horizon Incident Specific Preparedness Review’ (ISPR6) 
provides recommendations that serve to further enhance NIMS/ICS use in future spills.  

Based on lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, a Notice To 
Lessees (NTL) was issued by the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement 
(BSEE) providing ‘Guidance to Owners and Operators of Offshore Facilities Seaward of the 
Coast Line Concerning Regional Oil Spill Response Plans’7. The NTL provides clarification, 
guidance, and information concerning the preparation and submittal of a regional Oil Spill 
Response Plan (OSRP) for Oil and Gas Operators in the Gulf of Mexico.

The NTL encouraged lessees to specify primary and alternate communications technology 
and software for use when coordinating and directing oil spill response operations and/or 
providing a Common Operating Picture to all oil spill management and response personnel, 
including the Federal On-Scene Coordinator and participating federal and state government 
officials. 

 
Establishing an oil spill response COP 
Definition of a COP 

After consideration of several definitions provided by various parties, the following is 
considered to provide a concise definition of a Common Operating Picture: 

A Common Operating Picture (COP) is a computing platform based on Geographical 
Information System (GIS) technology that provides a single source of data and information 
for situational awareness, coordination, communication and data archival to support 
emergency management and response personnel and other stakeholders involved in or 
affected by an incident. 

Figure 2 provides a summary graphical perspective of a COP for responding to an oil spill.

In addition to the COP, an incident command will use other information technology (IT) tools 
and systems to support processes such as equipment and services procurement, internal 
and external communications, asset management, invoice/payments, claims and recovery, 
reporting, and so forth. Such systems are commercially available and are evolving in 
capability to include basic COP functionality.  

Integration of the COP with such systems is encouraged to facilitate information flow and 
simplify information management processes. However, the need to access high quality, 
reliable geospatial data from a variety of sources - including data that is proprietary to the oil 
company or its service providers - may necessitate that the COP is delivered and operated 
externally to these systems/tools. The interoperability standards that will form part of this 
guideline are designed to ensure that geospatial data can be integrated whilst applying 
appropriate levels of data security.  

Geographic setting and source of spill 

To understand how a COP can be used in a response it is important to understand the 
types of oil spill events targeted in this recommended practice. Figure 3 shows a set of 
scenarios in which a COP would be critical for effective Emergency Response.

COP Information Management Plan  

An Information Management Plan (IMP) should be developed at the beginning of any oil spill 
response using a standardized template prepared before the incident. This document would 
lay the groundwork for information management and data sharing across the response. It 
would include agreed upon data standards, field reporting requirements, media formats, as 
well as data archiving.  

In order for a COP to function effectively, it must provide operational information in near real-
time. This requires not only system continuity but also structure in the response organization 
to facilitate communication among the appropriate responders. Formalized ICS positions for 
information management are needed. In particular experts for geospatial information and 
remote sensing are needed either in the response or on call. 

Information available during the incident response needs to be retained for activities after the 
incident. Activities include maintaining accurate and comprehensive incident files, including 
a complete record of the major steps taken to resolve the incident as well as storing incident 
files for legal, analytical, and historical purposes. Snapshots of the COP and the Response 
Center database need to be made on a periodic basis and transferred to a location remote 
from the Response Center.  

Information release process 

Different users of the COP may have access to differing information based on access 
control. Access is provided to the data through role-based security established prior to the 
event. Access control is the selective restriction of access to resources. An access control 
policy is established as part of the COP information release process. The policy is then 
implemented as part of the deployment of the COP. Access control can involve 
authorization of access based on authentication of the user using a credentials system.  

User Identity and Management Services as deployed, for example in a web services 
environment for the COP, is discussed further below in this report. 

 
Users and developers of the COP 
Categories of users 

A COP is established and maintained by gathering, collating, synthesizing, and 
disseminating incident information for all appropriate parties. A COP potentially allows on-
scene and off-scene personnel to have the same information about the incident including 
the availability and location of resources and the status of assistance requests.  

Figure 5 is a list of potential types of users of a COP. While the intention is to provide the 
same basic information for all users, some specific types of information may be available to 
a limited set of users managed through the assignment of access privileges, as further 
explained in Section 3.1.3.

COP users are categorized as: 

1) Public (including media and academia) 
2) Responders (including the Response Center) 
3) Responsible Party 
 

 
 

 
ICS organization roles 

Experience has demonstrated the value of integrating incident response functions and 
resources into a single operational organization, managed and supported by one command 
structure and supporting processes. The IPIECA–IOGP ‘Incident Management System for 
the Oil and Gas Industry’ Good Practice Guide (IMS-GPG, IPIECA–IOGP, 2014)8 provides 
experienced-based good practice guidelines for incident management and emergency 
response personnel. IMS-GPG is based on the Incident Command System (ICS), a version 
of IMS that is widely used by industry, response contractors and professional emergency 
services organizations. An IMS includes a set of proven organizational and management 
principles including common organizational elements (e.g. sections, branches, divisions, 
etc.), management structure, terminology and operating procedures. 

The IPIECA–IOGP good practice guidelines define an organizational structure for an IMS to 
include four major sections under the Command function: Operations, Planning, Logistics 
and Finance/Administration (Figure 6).

Geomatics Unit of ICS Planning Section 

Given the pervasive and critical role of geospatial information to the COP for the response, it 
is recommended that a Geomatics Unit be defined within the Planning Section of the ICS 
structure. 

The Geomatics Unit oversees the management and collection of spatial data; provides 
mapping, spatial analysis and meeting support for the response. The unit also develops, 
manages, and updates the Common Operation Picture.  

Roles within the Geomatics Unit include: 

• Geomatics Liaison – this role serves as a single POC within the command post that 
accepts and officially documents requests on an ICS-form, and then delegates out the 
work to geo-information analysts. The person sitting in this role must be fluent in geo-
information to weed out inappropriate requests and understand basic deliverable 
timelines for geo-information products. This role serves as the data manager for geo-
information. They also could serve as the role of oversight for any response GIS 
database and/or “working” data repository. They would work with the incident 
documentation unit to make sure that the correct information is collected and that the 
responders have access to it.  

• Common Operating Picture Lead – this role publishes and updates the Common 
Operating Picture as the incident unfolds and attends official meetings to ‘drive’ the 
COP to support the talking points of the meeting. This role will also support briefings to 
executive leadership, the media, and local, state, federal authorities.  

• Geo-information Analyst – this role performs mapping and analysis on request from the 
liaison. The role may also take direct assignment or embed with other sections such as 
Operations or Logistics. Cartography expertise may be included in this role. 

• Geomatics Operations Specialist – arranges, specifies and coordinates survey 
operational activities required in support of the incident, including mobilizing survey 
equipment, vessels and resources, and overseeing safe operations. Geodesy and 
hydrography expertise may also be included in this role. 

• Remote Sensing Specialist – this role provides specialist technical expertise in the 
acquisition and interpretation of remote sensing data in support of oil spill detection and 
mapping, as well as the use of remote sensing techniques for environmental mapping 
and assessment. 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations

• Metocean Specialist – this role provides specialist technical expertise in the acquisition 
and interpretation of meteorological and oceanographic data and models in support of 
oil spill prediction and forecasting, in–situ measurements, and operational and logistic 
planning. 

 
Scenarios for use of a COP 
The following section outlines various scenarios for use of the COP within IMS. 
 
Command Section use 

The COP is the primary tool used for conducting daily command briefings during a 
response. A properly designed and implemented COP will visually show real-time or near 
real-time information within the area of responsibility (AOR). This will allow command staff to 
make decisions based upon actual and up-to-date information from the various sections of 
the response. The COP can be adapted and updated to meet the particular needs of a 
response, which often change due to the physical and political environment. Information 
present should include any datasets the command wants to see, report on, and discuss.  

This may include: 

• Satellite and aerial information 
• Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) data 

and video feeds 
• Real-time vessel locations from Automatic Identification System (AIS) feeds 
• Oil plume versus oil trajectory 
• Digital geo-tagged photographs of cleanup operations 
• Shoreline Cleanup and Assessment Technique (SCAT) data 
• Dispersant use data 
• Boom locations (planned and actual) 
• Skimming data 
• In-situ burn information 
• Wildlife sightings (dead and alive) 
• Anything else Command is interested in seeing 

Command should use the COP for reporting and analyzing the data. Examples include: 

• Percentage of shoreline oiled in a geographic area, sorted by oiling density 
• Percentage of shoreline cleaned in a geographic area  
• Number of individuals working in a geographic area 
• Total footage of boom deployed in an area 
• Results of a sampling program 
• Barrels of oil and oiled material collected in a specific geographic area

Use Case: The Public Information 

Officer (Command Staff) 
Actors: PIO, local media resources 

 

Summary 

Computer modeling supported by the morning over-flight reveals that the oil spill will soon 
impact the shoreline. 

The Public Information Officer (PIO) is preparing to brief local media resources on the new 
situation and turn of events. 

Preconditions 

Maps are used to support talking points during the local media briefing. 

Description (‘Sunny Day scenario’) Exceptions (‘Rainy Day scenario’) 

• The PIO uses the digital COP to support 
the talking points while briefing local 
media resources. 

• The ability to pan, zoom, and query 
results in the map makes the information 
easily readable to all the audience. 

• During the Q&A session the PIO uses 
the digital COP to support their answers; 
can pan, zoom, and query and focus on 
the current topic of discussion. 

• A better operations picture is conveyed 
to the audience. 

• The PIO uses wall-mounted large-
format paper maps to support talking 
points. 

• Map scale versus the area of coverage 
results in audience have difficulty seeing 
map information. 

• Paper maps leave the local media 
resources with an incomplete 
operations picture of the response, 
risking incorrect or incomplete 
information delivery to the public. 

 

Post conditions 

• Use of the digital COP results in the appearance of a better-informed response 
organization. 

• A digital COP conveys a rich operational picture to the local media or the local media is 
left to inferring facts because of the inherent limitations of paper maps. 

 

  



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

15 

Planning Section use 

The Planning Section of a response will use the COP to communicate planned activities out 
to other teams on the response. This may include in-situ burns, boom deployments, 
skimming operations and beach cleaning methods, as well as notifying responders of 
response areas on environmental hold or fishing closures. The Planning Section also uses 
the COP to report on activities such as SCAT surveys, oil plume trajectory, results of an over 
flight survey, areas on environmental hold, wildlife hazing activities, wildlife deaths, and 
sampling activities. The COP provides an enhanced situational status map; information can 
be gathered and disseminated in real or near real time, ready to be used by the Planning 
Section. 

Use Case: Situation Unit Lead 
(Planning Section) 

Actors: Situation Unit Lead, UC 

 

Summary 

Computer modeling supported by the morning over-flight reveals that the oil spill will soon 
impact the shoreline.  

The Situation Unit Lead is preparing to give a situational update to the Unified Command 
(UC) during the Command and general staff meeting. 

Preconditions 

Maps are used to support talking points during the briefing. 

Description (‘Sunny Day scenario’) Exceptions (‘Rainy Day scenario’) 

• The Situation Unit Lead uses the digital 
COP to support his talking points to the 
UC. 

• In response to questions from the UC, 
the Situation Unit Lead can pan, query, 
and zoom to various response areas in 
the COP to support the answers. 

• The Situation Unit Lead uses large-
format paper maps hung on the wall to 
support his talking points to the UC. 

• Ideal map scale versus area of coverage 
always results in information being left 
off the map. 

• Multiple maps are needed. 
• Use of paper maps require time for 

preparation and printing. 
• Necessitates the use of paper 

resources. 

Post conditions 

• Use of a digital COP results in a better-informed UC.  
• The sharing of information is efficient and is supported by reliable, up-to-date spatial 

information or use of paper maps may result in the UC having an incomplete 
operational picture.

Operations Section use  

Operations will use the COP to communicate planned activities to the field crews 
completing the tasks. The benefit of the COP is that it provides real-time access and 
location information on assets such as task forces, major vessels, and current and predicted 
weather information. Operations will also use the COP to communicate completed activities 
such as actual deployed boom, completed in-situ burn operations, and skimming locations 
and results. Typically operations are fully photographed and the resulting images are then 
immediately available for others in the response. 

Use Case: Operations Section Actors: Operations Section Chief, Branch 
Director for Shoreline Protection 

 

Summary 

Computer modeling supported by the morning over-flight reveals that the oil spill will soon 
impact the shoreline.  

The Operation Section Chief is racing against time to have cleanup crews deployed before 
spill reaches the shoreline. 

Preconditions 

Maps are used to support decision-making. 

Description (‘Sunny Day scenario’) Exceptions (‘Rainy Day scenario’) 

• A COP is available throughout the 
Incident Command Post. 

• A newly acquired remotely sensed 
image, included in the COP, is used for 
identifying best access points to the 
shoreline and possible staging areas by 
the Operations Section Chief and the 
Branch Director for Shoreline Protection. 

 

• A digital COP is not available 

• Paper maps are used to identify access 
points and staging areas. A crew chief 
out in the field later reports that a new 
housing development impedes the 
designated staging areas and access 
points. Must now find other suitable 
locations resulting in the loss of valuable 
response time. 

Post conditions 

• Decision making is efficient and is supported by reliable, up-to-date, shared spatial 
information or decision making is based on various sources of spatial information—
some conflicting, some incomplete —which contributes to a slower, more inefficient 
response 

 

  



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

17 

Legal Team use 

The COP may be used in long-term litigation support. The COP must provide all historical 
response data to fill this requirement. It must be designed to comply with legal hold orders, 
which means all data must be entered with date and time information. As this information is 
edited and deleted the underlying databases store all transaction information with each 
feature. This allows the legal team to virtually go back in time and see what operations and 
plans were in place on a particular day. Digital geo-tagged photographs are often in high 
demand by legal teams. A typical request is “show me all of the digital photographs on a 
certain date in a particular geographic area.” 

Public use 

Public use of the COP is on a consumption basis. The public is viewed as anyone that is not 
directly involved in the response. This includes but is not limited to the general public, 
NGOs, news agencies, and academics. The COP provides the public with information 
regarding current situational status of an incident. The type of information from the COP that 
is shared with the public is for the purpose of awareness as opposed to the decision-
making information provided to Command and other response sections.  

 

Use Case: General Public Actors: General Public 
 

Summary 

Computer modeling supported by the morning over-flight reveals that the oil spill will soon 
impact the shoreline.  

The Responsible Party and the Regulatory Party have approved on a public facing web 
application showing applicable response data.  

The general public also uses the COP data to better understand beaches and fisheries 
closed due to the incident. They can also leverage the COP in order to locate claims centers 

and incident volunteer centers.  

By having access to the most recent data and an interactive interface, the public can utilize 
the data as they wish, helping to alleviate apprehensions about the response status and 

concerns around information sharing. 

Preconditions 

Press releases and generalized graphics are used to convey spatial information on the 
current situation. 

The general public would have to go to a variety of different sites (State, City, Federal) to 
find out information about beach closures, closed fishing areas, claim centers, etc. A 

potential risk for the general that not all the information on these sites would be 
synchronized or up-to-date, therefor giving the public conflicting information. 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project

Description (‘Sunny Day scenario’) Exceptions (‘Rainy Day scenario’) 

• Public facing web applications informs 
the general public which beaches 
maybe impacted and/or closed in their 
area.  

• The general public is able to identify the 
nearest claims centers available to them. 

• The interactive experience gives the user 
access to the most up-to-date data with 
regards to fishing closures. This also 
helps advice the public as to which 
areas to avoid from a safety perspective.  

• Getting information into the public eye 
quickly and accurately helps thwart 
accusations of hiding data and helps 
promote good public relations. 

• The general public is only able to 
read/watch status updates from news 
outlets. 

• The user has to go several websites to 
find the information they need. 

• Lack of information presented and 
available to the public could result in 
accusations of hiding data. 

Post conditions 

• Use of a digital COP (public version) will result in a more informed public. This will give 
the public the most up-to-date spatial information (as approved by command and legal) 
all the while allowing them to interpret the data as they wish.  

• With all the data in one location, the public can be assured that the information is recent 
and pertinent to the current situation. This will provide transparency, which will help with 
public relations, especially in areas affected by the response.

Enterprise components for COP 
A framework for deploying the COP as a set of enterprise components using a web 
services-based architecture is shown in Figure 7. Enterprise components for the COP 
provide an overview of the technical elements used to meet the objectives defined in the 
earlier sections of this enterprise viewpoint. Details for implementing and deploying these 
components are provided in the Services Viewpoint (section 4) and the Deployment 
Viewpoint (section 5). 

The Response Center is the focus of the enterprise components – including the geospatial 
servers that will host the data needed for the users. Data coming from incident responders 
and additional data sources are ingested into the Response Center servers and quality 
checked before use in the COP. The COP is provided to connected users and supporting 
COPs using web services. Web services hosted at the Response Center is routine for 
medium and large size spills. As technology has progressed, e.g. with cloud hosting, web 
services have become easier and suitable to implement for all size spills. The Response 
Center also provides geospatial products for disconnected users. On a periodic basis the 
Response Center data is archived at a remote location.

COP Information Viewpoint 
The COP information landscape 
Basic principals 

An effective COP is grounded in the following basic principles: 

1. The responsible party will manage all data and provide data to government agencies 
having oversight of response actions as appropriate. 

2. All data will be archived and preserved as part of the critical records associated with the 
incident. 

3. Access to incident data will be required for a considerable period of time after the 
closure of the incident. 

4. A central repository of incident data will be created and maintained with the most 
current information available at any given time. 

5. “Snapshots” of incident data are required and will be saved on a weekly basis; they will 
be available for limited access during the incident and will be preserved afterward. 

6. Provenance of all data is to be captured at the time of data entry. 
7. COP recommendations are “technology neutral”; users may utilize whatever technology 

and applications are appropriate. 
8. The response effort is organized based on ICS structure and the roles. 

Information architecture 

The information architecture is predicated on the need for information to be processed, 
reviewed, and approved prior to being added to the official data store (labeled “Reporting” in 
the diagram). This process is important because it: 

• Allows information release timing to be managed. 
• Ensures data quality. 
• Allows management to be informed before general release of information. 
• Prevents contention between the technical GIS team and end users for system 

resources. 
• Allows data to be processed prior to display thus facilitating integration between 

datasets. 

A typical scenario would have a vendor collecting data associated with an event. At a 
prearranged interval the vendor would upload their data to the working data store. When 
data uploading is complete, manual or automated processing is conducted to check data 
accuracy, replace any obsolete data, and assign any key information to facilitate its 
integration with other datasets. If required, management can then review the data to ensure 
its readiness for publication. After all checks are complete the data is published to the 
“Reporting” data store and is made available to stakeholders according to their access 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

21 

privileges. Access is provided to the data through role-based security established prior to 
the event (see Section Authentication and authorization services 0). The roles defined by the 
ICS represent the most complete and common set.  

Data access model 

Figure 8 shows the model for data insertion and retrieval from the data repository. Typically 
data flows into the data repository through the top of the pyramid and is accessed the same 
way. It is expected that each event, vendor, or responsible party will require flexibility in how 
information is presented or inserted based on their particular tools and processes. 

The exception to this assumption is the provision of a set of templates defined for the COP.  

See Section 3.5.1 for more information on templates.  

 

Figure 8  Data access model 

User interface 
Data is presented through a user interface associated with applications purchased or built 
by the parties associated with the event and/or custom queries or maps created by the 
teams working the event. Each party may use different applications, maps, or reports, as 
long as the information specified within the COP is provided. Use of open standards, as 
specified later in this report, ensures that information can be consumed by different parties 
and applications, and recognizes the inevitability that in major OSR events, there will almost 
certainly be more than one COP deployed (refer to Figure 7 – “Supporting COPs”). Data will

be distributed using web services to network-connected users whilst other provisions can 
be made to deliver data to disconnected users. 

Data access can be split into two components:  

1) How a user physically connects to a data store. This includes technologies 
such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN), remote logins, web services, and direct 
database connections.  

2) The objects built to select data from a data store and serve it to the requesting 
party in a presentation-neutral fashion.  

Component 1 is discussed later in this document (section 4) while Component 2 is included 
in this section. 

Each data service should provide a logically complete set of information for the subject of 
interest. For example, if a data service is created to provide information about employees, 
the entire employee record should be provided.  

By following these rules, referential integrity can be enforced and data validity ensured. A 
standard set of data services is defined in Annex A but each application or company will no 
doubt want to enhance this set. 

Storage schemas 
It is critical that data is stored in the correct storage structure. This is accomplished by the 
creation of a standard storage schema(s) (also referred to as a data models). Storage 
schemas are typically documented through an entity-relationship diagram.  

Communication, integration and precision are the three key benefits that make a data model 
important to applications that use and exchange data. A data model is the medium through 
which project team members from different backgrounds and with different levels of 
experience can communicate with one another. Precision means that the terms and rules 
on a data model can be interpreted only one way and are not ambiguous. Integration allows 
us to view different data together and know that it is logically related or refers to the same 
common subject. 

A data model can be sometimes referred to as a data structure, especially in the context of 
programming languages. Data models are often complemented by function models, such 
as in the context of enterprise models. 

For the purposes of the COP, the storage schema is best separated into two distinct areas: 

1) Geospatial information. See section 3.2 for types of geospatial information. Typically 
this takes the form of feature classes, shapefiles, coverages, raster files, maps, or other 
proprietary data storage formats. These are the typical building blocks within a GIS. It is 
convenient that a GIS simplifies the creation and management of these data objects.  

2) Tabular information. Tabular data would typically be data associated with spill activities 
such as tracking resources, managing inventory, and textual information about the spill. This 
information is usually associated with a specific location but is more descriptive in nature.  



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

23 

This is an area where careful data analysis and modeling can make or break a system. 
Unless data is stored in structures that are defined correctly based on the relationships 
between the data elements and the data type of the elements, storing, retrieving, and linking 
to data will always be difficult. 

Data inventory 
The data needed to support an incident response is the key element in a COP. A complete 
list of data elements is provided in Annex A. 

 
Geospatial information 
Geographic or geospatial information is information concerning phenomena implicitly or 
explicitly associated with a location relative to the Earth (see ISO 19101-19). Geospatial 
information is often used as the basis to integrate assessments, situation reports, and 
incident notification into a COP and as a data fusion and analysis tool to synthesize many 
kinds and sources of data and imagery10.  

Everything about the COP—including the standards used to develop and maintain the 
system and data, the data that will be gathered and displayed, and how the system will 
integrate with other systems—depends on first understanding the underlying system. 
Section 3.3 outlines considerations that should be taken into account when planning and 
operating an OSR COP. 

The information that will be displayed in the COP will come from a variety of sources in a 
variety of formats. In order to effectively maintain, display, and allow users to interact with 
the information, careful consideration of the standards that will be used within the COP and 
how the data will be organized should be a key component of the planning and ongoing 
maintenance processes. The next sections of this report discusses geospatial information 
standards and organization.

Planning considerations 
There are two broad categories of data to consider when determining the data that the 
system should display. The first is base map or reference data, which includes information 
about the area and environment that are not specific to the oil spill incident. The categories 
of reference data that are applicable to many COP implementations are outlined later in this 
report. The second category of data, also outlined later, is drill and incident specific 
information that includes information about the spill and the spill response.  

The specific standards and data used to develop a COP will be driven by several 
considerations that include: 

• Origin of spill 
• Land-based vs. marine 
• Arctic vs. temperate, desert or tropical 
• Scope / tiered response 
• Data access 
• Availability of geographic information 
• Static vs. real time information 

Origin of spill 

An oil spill may originate at the wellhead, but it could also originate from a pipeline, 
infrastructure (such as a refinery or terminal), rail car, or a vessel such as a tanker. Each 
origin type will require a different approach by the oil spill response team and different 
geospatial data. Examples include the possibility of a mobile source when a vessel-based 
spill is encountered. 

Land-based vs. marine 

COP information requirements must properly account for the unique characteristics of both 
marine and land-based spills. Simple examples include the need for land status information 
for terrestrial spills or the need for bathymetric data for marine spills. 

Arctic vs. temperate, desert or tropical 

Multiple unique challenges (and unique information requirements) are represented based 
upon the setting of a spill incident. For instance, consider a spill occurrence in the arctic 
climate. In this setting, information that would be unnecessary in an incident occurring in 
temperate areas could become critical. Specifically, additional information relating to the 
forming and movement of ice, operational safety considerations, and other elements would 
become both relevant and significant to the spill response effort in such a scenario. For a 
given location, seasonal differences must also be considered, e.g. in gathering geospatial 
information for the appropriate season.

Tiered Response  

The established three-tiered structure allows those involved in contingency planning to 
describe how an effective response to any oil spill will be provided; from small operational 
spillages to a worst-case release at sea or on land. The structure provides a mechanism to 
identify how individual elements of capability will be cascaded. An organization’s response 
capability and contingency plan should relate directly to the potential spill scenarios and 
cover each tier, as appropriate. It is important to note that the tiers are strictly for planning 
purposes and, in the event of a spill, whatever resources are necessary to adequately 
respond to the spill must be mobilized regardless of the tier. Planning according to the 
tiered approach ensures that an appropriate provision of resources is considered for a 
response of any magnitude as applies to an organization’s risk. It enables responders with 
access to adequate resources to mobilize an effective and timely initial response using pre-
planned strategies and Tier 1 capabilities and to cascade in additional resources as they 
adapt to any response as it unfolds. Further information can be found in the IPIECA–IOGP 
‘Tiered Preparedness and Response’ Good Practice Guide11. 

Role based access to data  

The organization and security applied to geospatial information within the COP should 
clearly delineate between information sets that are accessible to the operator and its direct 
constituents, as opposed to information that may be published for external (public) use. 

Access to information is controlled by the role people fill in the response effort. For example, 
the Incident Commander can view different data than the public. Not only are their data 
access privileges different, the way they view the same data might be very different. The 
simplest example is summary views versus detailed views of the same data items. 

Availability of geospatial information 

The availability of geospatial information may be heavily dependent on the geographical 
location of an oil spill incident. For example, in North America, a wide array of government, 
commercial and environmental organizations may provide reference and/or operational 
information free of charge and without license restrictions. In other locations, it may not be 
possible to obtain the same wide array of information from such organizations and there will 
be greater reliance on third party vendor datasets, which will likely have restricted access 
due to the data licensing terms and conditions. In this case, the Responsible Party or 
government may need to negotiate alternative license terms with the data suppliers so that 
the data can be shared with the key users.

Static vs. real-time information 

Some of the information provided to the COP will be in real-time. The handling of this 
dynamic information impacts the design and the use of the COP. For example, should the 
COP display real-time depths or static depths as referred to on the chart datum on the one 
hand, and tidal information on the other hand, and both in separate layers? Also, this 
presents a challenge when archiving and storing data for future use and reference in time. 
Static information is relative easy to archive, however when consuming a service which 
shows real time information, such as weather information, there needs to be a method to 
capture it for future use.  

 
Geospatial information standardization and 
organization 
Need for geospatial information standards 

Consistent standards are important for the use of geospatial information as it has the 
potential to be misinterpreted, transposed incorrectly, or otherwise misapplied, causing 
inconspicuous yet serious errors. Standards make it easier for disparate systems utilized 
during an incident to consume, analyze, display and interact with the information.  

Such standards include: 

• Coordinate reference system 
• Metadata (e.g. ISO 19115) 
• Cartographic symbolization 
• Scale of use, and accuracy 
• Data structure and format 

Coordinate Reference System 

Maintaining the ‘coordinate integrity’ of all geospatial data ingested, processed and 
displayed in the COP is vitally important to ensure that all data is displayed in its correct 
geographical location, both in an absolute and relative sense. For each dataset, it is 
important to know the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) relevant to the coordinates of 
the geographical features. For a dataset defined in geographical terms (latitude, longitude), 
the CRS defines the geodetic datum and reference ellipsoid or spheroid. For a projected 
(grid) dataset, the CRS will in addition define the map projection and its associated 
parameters, including units of measure. CRS information is therefore key metadata that 
needs to be associated with all datasets. Failure to correctly account for the CRS can lead 
to positioning errors of 100s of meters, or unusable data. 

Knowledge of the positional accuracy of datasets is also important to ensure data is not 
used at map scales that are incompatible with their accuracy. Within a GIS system, the use 
of ‘scale management’ ensures that map features are only displayed or plotted at map 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

27 

scales they were intended for by setting upper and lower scale limits for each dataset. 
Beyond these limits, the data will not be displayed or mapped. The COP system 
administrators are responsible for assigning such parameters based on their knowledge of 
the accuracy of the data and its source. 

The primary standards for Coordinate Reference Systems applicable to the Oil and Gas 
industry are those defined by the IOGP Geomatics committee in the EPSG database and 
associated online registry of global coordinate reference systems.12 

IOGP Geomatics guidelines, such as ‘Geodetic awareness guidance note (S&P 
01)’  (document ref 373-01), provide a useful reference for those unfamiliar with the topic, 
and the IOGP’s Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience software (GIGS) guidelines provide 
methods for testing the integrity of software applications with respect to the correct handling 
of coordinate information13.  

Other useful reference information can be found in the ISO 19111:2007 ‘Geographic 
information -- Spatial referencing by coordinates’14 and the Open Geospatial Consortium’s 
‘Abstract Specification Topic 2 - Spatial referencing by coordinates’15. These OGC and ISO 
standards are identical and are aligned with IOGP/EPSG standards. 

At a very early stage in an oil spill event, the appropriate CRS for the area shall be chosen 
and then used as the primary CRS within the GIS system. Any incoming data, which is 
based on a different CRS, will be transformed before integration into the COP. Accordingly, 
the availability of software to convert and transform data from different CRS is essential, as 
is having access to expert advice from a qualified geodesist. The choice of CRS will depend 
on the geographical extent of the incident, the regulatory environment, and common 
practice in the area. The EPSG registry16 provides a useful reference of CRS applicable to 
specific geographies and countries. 

Due to limitations in the technical capabilities of current web mapping technology, there may 
be constraints in the choice for a projected CRS for the COP map viewer (refer to section 
4.2.3). Most current technologies adopt the Pseudo Mercator projection (EPSG Code 
3857), which is based on the WGS84 datum (as used by Google Maps, Bing Maps etc.). 
Such a projection has severe limitations at high latitudes with significant distortion of 
distances and areas. The COP should warn users of such distortions. For incidents in the 
Polar Regions, appropriate polar map projections must be used. 

Longer term, and when the technology allows, it is recommended to use a General 
Perspective projection (EPSG Code 9838), such as that used in products like Google Earth

and ArcGIS Explorer. The General Perspective projection provides a point of perspective at 
an infinite (deep space) distance from the earth, providing an acceptable map projection at 
any location in the world.  

For map printing purposes it is recommended to use the projected CRS chosen as 
applicable to the geographical area of the spill. With reference to section 4.6.2, 
recommended practice is to use a standard map template, which will clearly specify the 
chosen CRS (including the EPSG code). 

The above implies that the map projection used for the COP map viewer may be different to 
that chosen for management of the geospatial data, for spatial analysis or processing, and 
for hardcopy map purposes. The COP support team must have the resources and expertise 
to handle the manipulation and quality assurance of the data to avoid any coordinate 
integrity errors occurring. 

Consideration should also be given to the Vertical Datum for any data that refers to 
topographic heights or bathymetric (water) depths. In general it is recommended to use 
Mean Sea Level (MSL) (EPSG Code 5100) as the default vertical datum, however when 
working offshore with published nautical charts, it is likely that such charts will use a different 
Vertical Datum (usually known as ‘Chart Datum’). This datum is often chosen to be 
equivalent to the Lowest Astronomical Tide, and, depending on the tidal regime in the area, 
could be offset significantly from the Mean Sea Level.  

Metadata 

Metadata should be captured and added to and maintained as datasets are created and 
populated. Information should not be considered complete unless it has metadata with it. 
Where possible, individuals generating the information should be the ones creating the 
metadata. The very minimum metadata to be captured is the provenance of the data, 
including: 

• Source of the information 
• Date of capture 
• Contact 
• Description of the information 
• Any processing done to change the source information 
• Any known limitations or issues with the information 
• Geographic area of coverage 
• Quality of data 

Industry best practice for metadata is ISO 19115: Geographic Information – Metadata. It is 
recommended a profile of ISO 19115 is developed to define which metadata needs to be 
covered for the OSR COP.

Map symbolization 

Map or cartographic symbolization should be standardized across the spectrum of the 
COP, including paper maps, web mapping, and mobile mapping. Any responder should be 
able to immediately use any and all of the different COP products without having to decipher 
the information. Where possible and appropriate, the COP should make use of community 
and international standards, some examples of which include:  

• ICS map symbology as defined by the USCG17 (Figure 9). 
• Environmental Sensitivity Index mapping standards from IPIECA-47718  (Figure 10 and 

Figure 11). 
• The Shell Standard Legend (oil and gas cartographic symbols)19. 
• IOGP Seabed Survey Model Symbology standards, which in Version 2 will become 

closely aligned with the IHO standards20 . 
• UK Government- Civil Protection Common Map Symbology21 . 
• IHO standards for nautical and hydrographic charts22. The IHO S-100 framework 

encompasses features such as tides, currents and other categories of nautical 
information. 

 

Figure 9 provides an example of symbols for use on maps and charts as developed in the 
ICS community [USCG]. This symbology has some limitations and will be considered for 
revision in the Data Modeling task of this Recommended Practice.

However the majority of the oil spill-specific standardization does not exist or what does 
exist was designed long ago and thus does not account for digital mapping systems. It is 
recommended that a standardized set of map symbolization should be created to support 
all of the oil spill-specific defined datasets. The symbology should be zoom scale 
dependent; at times, depending upon zoom scale, the symbology may need to change. For 
example a vessel task force may be represented as single point feature when zoomed out 
but when zoomed in it may show all the vessels that make up the task force. It is thus 
recommended that oil spill-specific symbology standardization is developed (it is currently 
planned to be accomplished in a future phase of this project as part of initiatives to create 
specific OSR data schemas and models). This approach has been successfully used by 
IOGP in the development specific GIS data models or schemas, an example being those 
developed for the Seabed Survey Data Model (see reference above).  

Scale of use and accuracy 

Scale is defined as the relationship between the distance on map and the distance in the 
real-world context. Scale of use and accuracy for response data being used in a COP 
application will vary based on the data layer type (point, line, polygon, and raster) and the 
maximum and minimum spatial extent. Whether the spill is large or small, all GIS data and 
raster layers should have scale information noted and should leverage reasonable scale 
dependencies when being displayed in an application. Setting a standard scale for data 
collection can be difficult and may only apply to spills in small geographic areas (harbors, 
small bays, etc.). Therefore, understanding and leveraging scale information will not only 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

33 

help with visual presentation and organization in an application, but it is important with 
ensuring accurate data analysis and even system preformation.  

The resolution of the data is also a key factor. In an oil spill response environment there is 
little control over the resolution or scale from third party vendor data unless it has been prior 
established. It is therefore important information to note and record the scale and resolution 
of the data when acquiring its from external sources. Polygon layers and data covering wide 
spatial extents (e.g. oil plumes, oil trajectories, coverage areas) can vary greatly in detail. If 
the scale and resolution are big and broad, it can result in oversimplification and, if not 
layered correctly in an application, can hide other layers.  

Conversely, the use of detailed data can result in data illegibility if used at higher scales. For 
example, line and point data that have been collected at fine scales can quickly clutter both 
map products and web applications. Within oil spill response, this may include features such 
as boom, dispersant lines, and even the land-water interface for shoreline. In addition, finer 
detail and a higher resolution can cause the data to render slower, prolonging processing 
time. To ensure data accuracy and speedy spatial analysis, it is recommended that scale 
and resolution is noted in the metadata. Data with low resolution overlaid or analyst against 
high resolution can leave a lot of room for error and/or approximation, running the risk of 
reducing the data integrity. 

A recommended standard is to avoid changing scale by more than two and half times in 
either direction for data collection and display. However, response data varies in both 
feature type, size, scale, extent, and display priority. Logical scale dependencies need to be 
considered for optimal display and labeling when in use by a web application. Only a few 
key data layers should be displayed at all scales. 

 
Map templates list 
Map templates allow the COP to present geospatial information to the end users in a 
coherent fashion by providing selected sets of information for specific purposes. Mapping 
templates specific to OSR contain base map layers, incident specific information, commonly 
used page layouts, reports from the data, and standard symbology. Examples include the 
following:

Data modeling 
It is the intention of WP5 to create an application and/or database schemas where 
necessary. This is the focus of the next phase of activity and will be added to future versions 
of this document, probably in phases, as it is completed. The following subject areas have 
been identified for analysis: 

• SCAT 
• Airborne observations  
• Satellite interpretations 
• Oil spill trajectories 
• Boom 
• Dispersant (aerial, surface and sub-surface.) 
• In-situ burning 
• Skimming 
• Oil/gas infrastructure 
• ICS Command Post, branches, decontamination, staging areas 
• Geo-tagged photos and videos 

To ensure that both computer systems and users will understand information, the structures 
used in access and exchange must be adequately specified. An application schema 
provides the formal description of the structure and content required by one or more 
applications. An application schema for geographic information contains the descriptions of 
both geographic features, as well as related information. The feature is a fundamental 
concept of geographic information. 

The purpose of an application schema is twofold:  

• To provide a computer-readable data description defining the structure, which makes it 
possible to apply automated mechanisms for data management. 

• To achieve a common and correct understanding of the data by documenting the 
content of the particular application field, thereby making it possible to unambiguously 
retrieve information from the data 

Feature modeling is specified in ISO 19109:2005 ‘Geographic information – Rules for 
application schema’23. Conceptual schemas define abstract feature types and provide the 
process for domain experts to develop application schemas that are used to encode 
content and describe feature instances. The developer of an application schema may use

Application schemas relevant to oil spill response and strongly recommended to be adopted 
include: 

• IOGP Seabed Survey Data Model (SSDM)24, which is a specification, used in the oil and 
gas exploration & production (E&P) industry in handling the delivery of various seabed 
survey datasets in GIS data format. It also includes SeabedML, a GML implementation 
that enables open data exchange of geographical features and is particularly useful for 
web-enabled platforms.  

• OGC maintains an informal list of all known Geographic Markup Language (GML) 
Application Schemas25. These schemas are not necessarily approved or endorsed by 
the OGC. 

• CleanSeaNet26 has defined two types of information from satellite images that can be 
delivered as features in GML: oil spills and vessels27. 

• IHO S-100 provides the data framework for the development of the next generation of 
ENC products, as well as other related digital products required by the hydrographic, 
maritime and GIS communities. 

 
 

Geospatial information datasets 
Categories of geospatial information 

For clarity, in the ongoing management and maintenance of geospatial-related information, 
the COP implementation distinguishes two distinct sets of information: 

• Base map or reference information: this information typically exists in some form prior 
to the occurrence of a spill incident and should be gathered and updated routinely as 
newer information becomes available. Base map or reference information may not be 
pertinent to a specific incident. 

• Drill and incident specific information: this includes all of the relevant information that 
is generated during and after a spill incident and pertains specifically to that incident. 

Examples are listed in the following sections for each category of information.

Base map or reference information 

Base map or reference information includes information about the area and environment: 

• Background data 
• Administrative boundaries & 

references information 
• Marine jurisdictions 
• Bathymetry & hydrography 
• Topography 
• Imagery & remote sensing 
• Natural resources, habitats, & 

managed areas

infrastructure 

• Oil & gas infrastructure 
• Restoration data 
• Weather, oceanography & 

natural hazards 

 
The following sections provide more information about each type of information but the 
specific considerations surrounding an oil spill event will ultimately drive decisions about 
which type of base map and reference data are necessary and appropriate for the oil spill 
response teams. 

Background data 
Background data contains the information (datasets) utilized to present a base map. A base 
map is generally a non-editable dataset that provides background information pertinent to 
the geographic area of interest. It is typically designed to provide a visual reference for other 
information to help orient the user(s) of the map.  

Base map background information may be provided by any of the following source 
datasets: 

• Shoreline 
• Streets 
• Peripheral facilities, structures 
• Aerial photography 
• Satellite images 

Administrative boundaries & references information 
Administrative boundaries and references information provide contextual overlays to the 
base map background and include the following information sets: 

• Geopolitical boundaries (states or provinces, counties or parishes, tribal lands, 
congressional or other governmental districts) 

• Governmental agency regions & offices 
• Place names & references (special geographic features, Geographic Names Information 

System (GNIS)) 
 
 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

39 

• Marine jurisdictions including: 
o Exclusive economic zones 
o Country or state/province waters 
o Unique marine protected areas 

• The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) 

Geopolitical Boundaries 
Any and all administrative entities representing country, state/province, county, and city (or 
similar geopolitical boundaries) within the region(s) of interest should be represented in this 
set of information. This information may be obtained from sources ranging from the United 
Nations Second Administrative Level Boundaries (SALB)28 database, to city data contained 
in the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) information sets. 

Government Agency Regions & Offices 
Administrative boundaries for governmental agencies may also be included in reference 
information. Some possible examples of this information include the following: 

• U.S. Coast Guard Areas of Responsibility (USCG AOR)  
• USCG districts 
• National Park Service (NPS) boundaries 
• Aboriginal Land Governance  
• Port jurisdiction zones 
• Coastal wetlands 
• Wildlife refuges or managed areas 
• Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regions 
• Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) regions 
• U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) civil districts 
• USACE regulatory districts 
• U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) regions 

Marine jurisdictions 
Marine jurisdictions encompass the collection of marine boundaries and limits used to 
delineate the extent of a nation's sovereignty, exclusive rights, jurisdiction, and control over 
the maritime areas off its coast. Examples include the following: 

• Marine jurisdictions 
• Continental shelf boundary 
• Federal / state boundaries 
• Coast Guard boundaries 
• Oil and gas leases / blocks 
• Renewable energy leases

Bathymetry & hydrography 
Key to any marine-based oil spill, bathymetry information provides reference material 
containing measurements of water depth (or depths of other major bodies of water) relative 
to a specific vertical datum. A wide range of bathymetry information is available from 
multiple sources and different formats, including national hydrographic services or resellers 
of digital chart data, port services, and other suppliers.  

In addition, oil company operators will normally have detailed bathymetry measurements of 
their operating areas obtained from vessel-based geophysical and hydrographic surveys.  

Bathymetry data may be delivered in different data structures such as raster images 
(scanned charts), as digital terrain models, or as data points (soundings) and vectors 
(contours or isobaths). The most accurate and reliable information shall be used from the 
best available source and suitable for the scale of use. 

In addition, this section may include shoreline information sets representing the most recent 
available data to depict shoreline boundaries, including both seaside and inland (estuary) 
borders. 

The range of information goes from “source data” to “derived products” such as paper 
nautical charts or Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC), noting that derived products are 
designed for specific purposes (i.e. safety of navigation) which are generally different from 
the purpose of the COP. Bathymetric surfaces (as defined in IHO Standard S-102) should 
always be preferred, when available, to charts. Nautical charts are generally available in 
raster format. Most nautical charts are now available as ENCs. Note that the GEBCO 
project, managed jointly by the IHO and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission 
(IOC), seeks to provide the world’s most authoritative public bathymetric dataset and make 
it available to all those that have a need to understand the depth and the shape of the world 
seas, oceans and coastal waters.29  

Topography 
Topographic information (e.g. elevation data) may also be required for coastal regions 
impacted by the spill and may be available from topographic maps, digital terrain models, 
aerial surveys, or site-specific oil company surveys.  

In the U.S., seamless land-sea datasets have been developed in many coastal states to 
support coastal zone management and marine spatial planning. They should be used 
wherever available, preferably to separate topographic and bathymetric datasets that are 
often referred to with different vertical datums and not necessarily contiguous.

Imagery & remote sensing 
Surveillance products are important geospatial information that will be used during an oil 
spill event, both to provide eye-in-the-sky overview imagery of impacted areas and to 
quantify spill areas. The data is collected as satellite imagery and airborne-based aerial 
photographs, as well as from in-water and surface-deployed sensors and platforms. 
Remote sensing imagery may also be obtained from sensors deployed on land, vessels or 
offshore structures, or from tethered balloons (aerostats). Surveillance using drones and 
UAVs is also now a viable option. 

Accurate geo-referencing of such imagery to a common coordinate reference system is 
essential. In addition, satellite imagery and aerial photographs may need to be ortho-
rectified (i.e. an ortho-rectification process adjusts images to correct for terrain displacement 
and camera tilt). 

The OSR-JIP Work Program1 (In-Water Surveillance) provides a detailed overview of the 
types of in-water and surface-deployed platforms and sensors and the respective geospatial 
information available for use in detecting and monitoring of marine oil spills. 

The OSR-JIP Work Program 2 (Surface Surveillance) provides a detailed overview of the 
types of remote sensing geospatial information available for use in detecting and monitoring 
of marine oil spills.  

The COP will need to have the capability to handle and display any type of remote sensing 
imagery and be able to provide clear metadata to describe its source/origin, temporal 
characteristics, and so forth.  

Natural resources, habitats, & managed areas 
Natural resources, habitats and managed areas provide a wide range of information about 
habitat areas for wildlife in the area of interest, as well as areas defined as environmentally 
sensitive or protected. 

In each subsection of this category, multiple subcategories may be required to organize the 
extensive array of wildlife and natural resource data.  

Within each of the habitat areas, the subcategories for different species of wildlife and 
vegetation may be further detailed. Typically this information includes examples such as 
nesting, breeding and migration pattern data for the respective wildlife species, and 
coverage of submerged and shoreline vegetation. 

A few specific examples of the information sets in this hierarchy are the following: 

• Sediments 
• Deep sea corals 
• Benthic habitats 
• Artificial reefs 
• Cold-water coral habitats 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

42 

Critical habitat and essential fish areas 
Critical habitat information may be required in a geographic region containing threatened 
and endangered species as designated by the country or state/province laws. In addition, 
essential fish habitat information may be required, including aquatic habitats for managed 
species where fish may spawn, breed, feed, and grow into maturity. 

Environmentally Sensitivity Index (ESI) 
Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps provide summary information pertaining to 
coastal resources that are at risk in the event of an oil spill. At-risk resources may include 
biological resources (such as birds and shellfish beds), sensitive shorelines (such as 
marshes and tidal flats), and human-use resources (such as public beaches and parks). 

The potential exists for such mapping to be available in all areas where oil and gas 
exploration and production takes place and for it to be maintained at a regular frequency 
(e.g. every five years). However, it is recognized that this would be a significant undertaking 
and would require a coordinated industry approach. 

In response to an oil spill, ESI maps can help responders by reducing the environmental 
consequences of the spill and the cleanup efforts. Additionally, ESI maps can be used by 
planners to identify vulnerable locations, establish protection priorities, and define cleanup 
strategies. 

Some examples of specific information gathered for ESI analysis include the following: 

• Bird habitat 
• Breakwaters 
• ESI index 
• Fish habitat  
• Hydrological classification 
• Invertebrate habitat  
• Management areas  
• Marine mammal habitat  
• Access / vehicular access to 

shoreline 
• Reptile habitat  
• Socioeconomic (line)  

• Socioeconomic (point)  
• Shoreline classification (line) 
• Shoreline classification (polygon) 
• Terrestrial mammal habitat  
• Vegetation 
• Hazardous waste site 
• Hoist 
• Lock/dam 
• Logging 
• Marine sanctuary or wildlife 

refuge 
• NOAA buoy data 

ESI maps should utilize the standard symbology defined by IPIECA [IPIECA-477]. The 
symbol library for ESI maps is presented in Figure 10. 

  



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

43 

Shoreline Classification 
Shoreline classification typically incorporates the use of the ESI, which can be adapted for 
each country. The ESI, ranging from 1 (low sensitivity) to 10 (very high sensitivity), considers 
the following attributes: 

• Shoreline type (including grain size and slope) which evaluates the capacity of oil 
penetration, movement, and/or burial on the shore.  

• Exposure to tidal energy (waves) which ascertains the natural persistence time of oil on 
the shoreline. 

• General biological productivity and sensitivity. 

A standardized color-coding methodology for shoreline classification should be 
implemented, based upon IOGP Report Number 477, ‘Sensitivity Mapping for Oil Spill 
Response’. This color-coding methodology is presented in Figure 11. 

Socioeconomic data 
This information includes human-use / resource data for airports, archaeological and historic 
sites, beaches, boat ramps, state borders, bridges, and marinas for a given region, such as 
a state. Location-specific type and source information are typically stored in relational data 
tables designed to be used in conjunction with this information. 

In mapping socioeconomic information, the objective is not to identify all places of business 
and activity in a comprehensive fashion, but to locate the activities and the areas, which 
have the potential to suffer the greatest impact in the event of a spill incident. 

ESI maps should utilize the standard symbology defined by IPIECA for relevant 
socioeconomic sites. The symbol library for socioeconomic sites of interest is presented in 
Figure 12. 

Navigation & marine infrastructure 
Navigation & marine infrastructure layers include information such as: 

• Ports (including ferries, marinas, boat launch sites) 
• Maritime Collision Regulation Lines 
• Anchorage Areas 
• Shipping Lanes 
• Precautionary Areas for Navigation 
• Dredge Disposal Areas 
• Wrecks, Debris, and Archaeology Sites 

Most of this information is available from nautical charts and other nautical publications, as 
well as in the format of Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs). An ENC is an authoritative 
product with a mature definition and methodology for modeling the information (currently in 
IHO S-57 and in the future in IHO S-101). 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project

Public safety & terrestrial infrastructure 
Public safety & infrastructure information includes: 

• Critical infrastructure 
o Hospitals 
o Police stations 
o Water intakes 
o Fire stations 
o Power generation facilities 
o Power lines and substations 

• Transportation infrastructure

accurate as-built surveys often created during construction activities or as a result of routine 
maintenance operations.

habitat restoration projects and may contain species and habitat data relevant to spill 
exposure.

• Real-time data feeds and forecasts 
for weather, including atmospheric 
pressure 

• Precipitation forecasts  
• Natural hazards such as 

earthquakes, tsunamis, and 
hurricanes

Drill- and incident-specific information 

Drill and incident specific information includes the following primary categories:  

• Abstract, spill summary & reporting 
• Damage assessment 
• Oil spill response operations 

For legal purposes, all information collected in the drill & incident specific hierarchy should 
be retained and archived, and changes to information in this hierarchy should be properly 
recorded (track changes), to allow post-incident review and timeline analysis. 

Abstract, spill summary & reporting 
The abstract, spill Summary & reporting section of the hierarchy contains the basic details of 
the incident or drill, including the following information: 

• Incident abstract 
• Spill origin details 
• Wreckage details 
• Summary reports and findings 

Incident abstract 
The incident abstract is a high-level summary of the incident, including basic attributes such 
as the operator, rig, well(s), or other source of the spill (e.g. ruptured pipeline), origin 
country/location, and an initial assessment of the scope based upon the IPIECA multi-tiered 
model [IPECA-V14]. 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

46 

Spill origin details 
In a spill incident originating from a well, the specific details of the wellhead location are 
critical to both the damage assessment and the operational response activities that follow. If 
multiple wellheads exist, the location of adjacent wellheads should also be detailed, with 
information about the location, purpose, function, and current operating status of adjacent 
wellheads included. This section should accommodate details for other spill origins as noted 
above, such as pipelines, infrastructure, or vessels. 

Such information will be provided by the operator. 

Wreckage details 
In a spill incident originating from a marine-based well in which rig wreckage occurs, the 
details of the wreckage must be captured to mitigate the risk of possible damage to marine-
based operations in the vicinity of the wreckage, if such wreckage exists. As noted above, 
this section should accommodate details for other spill origins as well. 

Summary reports & findings 
Summary reports are used to release information updating the status of the spill incident.  

Damage assessment 
The damage assessment hierarchy contains all of the subcategories relating to 
assessments, evaluations and observations of the damage resulting from an oil spill, 
including: 

• Imagery and remote sensing 
• Damage assessment organization information 
• Over-flight observations 
• Trajectories and extents 
• Wildlife observations 

Imagery and remote sensing 
This subcategory includes imagery and remote sensing of the actual spill incident, and 
impact area of the spill. The data comes from in-water and surface-deployed platforms and 
sensors as well as aerial and satellite platforms. IOGP JIP Work Package 1 on In-Water 
Surveillance provides guidelines for in-water and surface-deployed platforms and sensors 
and their use in detecting and monitoring of marine oil spills. IOGP JIP Work Package 2 on 
Surface Surveillance provides detailed guidelines about the use of remote sensing 
techniques, including aerial observations, for surface surveillance of oil spills. 

Aerial observation is typically the primary element of effective response to marine oil spills. It 
is used to assess the location and extent of oil contamination, and to confirm predictions of 
the movement and outcome of marine oil spills. Aerial observation provides information that 
aids in: the planning of operations at sea; the timely protection of locations along the 
threatened shorelines; as well as the preparation of resources for the cleanup of affected 
coastline. Dedicated remote sensing aircraft frequently have built-in downward looking 
cameras to accurately geocode photographs of an impact area. 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

47 

When an oil spill occurs, information collected from helicopter or plane flights over the spill 
area helps responders assess the extent of the spill. The location of the oil, along with 
detailed observations about its appearance, is recorded onto an over-flight map. Photos 
taken during the over-flight may subsequently be associated to the over-flight map based 
on geographical coordinates obtained at the time the photo is taken. Use of a latest 
generation GPS-enabled camera or smart phone, will ensure that the photograph metadata 
(EXIF) includes the GPS coordinates as well as photo orientation, inclination, date/time. 
However other key metadata will need to be added manually, such as operator or mission 
description, by using, for example, an EXIF metadata software application (freeware).  

Over-flight paths, information and photos are another important resource for operations 
planning within an oil spill incident. 

For ease of incorporating data interpreted from remotely sensed imagery into the COP and 
to avoid the need for manual digitizing or re-formatting the data, the use of industry 
standards for acquiring and encoding the data is recommended. 

Damage assessment organization information 
This portion of the hierarchy includes the workgroup analysis and study information typically 
included in the preliminary assessment and restoration planning for injured natural resources 
and lost use of public properties. Among the typical assessments included in these 
information sets are the following: 

• Sample stations – identification of sampling locations, purpose of sampling, and 
attributes relating to the obtained sample materials. 

• Cumulative oiling – measures of potential cumulative surface oil exposure in the vicinity 
of a spill. 

• Sediment chemistry – location and chemical attribute analysis of sediments obtained 
from various sampling locations. 

• Oil chemistry – location and chemical attribute analysis of spilled oil obtained from 
various sampling locations. 

• Tissue chemistry – location and chemical attribute analysis of organic tissue obtained 
from various sampling locations. 

• Water chemistry – location and chemical attribute analysis of water obtained from 
various sampling locations. 

• General environmental quality – includes additional sampling and analysis information 
for specific conditions, such as establishing baseline conditions in water chemistry, 
bottom sediments, and aquatic invertebrates prior to landfall of the oil spill. 

Over-flight observations 
When an oil spill occurs, information collected from helicopter or plane flights over the spill 
area helps responders assess the extent of the spill. The location of the oil, along with 
detailed observations about its appearance, is recorded onto an over-flight map. Photos 
taken during the over-flight may subsequently be associated to the over-flight map based 
on coordinates obtained at the time the photo is taken. Over-flight paths, information, and 
photos are another important resource for operations planning in an oil spill incident. 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

48 

Trajectories & extents 
Trajectories & extents present snapshots of the directional flow/movement, concentration, 
and range of the spill, for the purpose of planning OSR efforts. Trajectories should provide 
information to perform the following post-spill analysis: 

• Oiling analysis – evaluation of how a given location would be affected by the flow or the 
movement of spilled oil based on current trajectories. 

• Response time analysis – evaluation of where and when response actions must be 
taken to mitigate the impact of possible oil arrival. 

• Shoreline impact analysis – evaluation of which shoreline areas are likely to be affected 
based on the spill trajectory. 

Oil spill trajectory information is normally obtained from specialized modeling software either 
operated by a regulatory body, the oil and gas operator, or by an independent specialist 
organization (Figure 13 provides an example of the ASA oil spill model, OILMAP).

Wildlife observations 
This portion of the Damage Assessment category allows for the tracking of specific wildlife 
groups that may be impacted by a spill incident. Several examples of wildlife observations 
include: 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

49 

• Bird observations – includes information pertinent to the date and location of the 
observation, oiling characteristics, condition of the animal(s), count of animals observed 
at the location, and species and observation details. 

• Reptile observations – examples include sea turtles and other amphibious reptiles. 
• Marine mammal observations – includes reporting on both live and dead observations. 

Typically dead observations are reported as marine mammal stranding, where stranding 
is defined as a dead or debilitated animal that washes ashore or is found in the water.  

OSR operations 
OSR operations information includes:  

• Areas of operation 
• Operations implementation 
• Response sampling & monitoring 
• Closures 
• Community support 

Areas of operation 
The area of operation is defined by the response organization. It should include (at a 
minimum) the following information sets: 

• Access points – identification of physical shoreline locations providing access for 
various forms of operational response equipment and personnel. 

• Base locations – identification of the Tier 1 (small bases typically used to store 
equipment such as boom and skimmers), Tier 2 (designed for larger equipment levels, 
and typically accommodating increased personnel), and Tier 3 (intended to deal with 
incidents where the equipment and supplies are managed by a group of commercial 
and/or governmental organizations). 

• Command locations – identification of the locations designated by the response 
organization as primary, division, and branch operational sites. 

• Decontamination sites – locations designated by the operations organization for 
decontamination of equipment and materials (such as retrieved boom) used in the spill 
response  

• Shoreline divisions – designating areas of operation for Shoreline Cleanup and 
Assessment Technique (SCAT) surveys and related response activities. 

• Staging areas – locations designated by the operations organization for staging of 
response equipment and personnel. 

Operations implementation 
Operations implementation covers all aspects of operations-related activities that are 
initiated to mitigate the impact of the oil spill, including: 

• Boom deployment & retrieval 
• Dispersant applications 
• Hesco basket & sand bag deployment 
• In-situ burning 
• Operations equipment/resource tracking 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

50 

• Operations cleanup (SCAT/STR) 
• Personnel tracking 
• Restricted areas 
• Sorbent materials 
• Skimming operations 

Boom deployment & retrieval 
Boom is a common type of oil spill response equipment normally used to protect shorelines 
or sensitive locations by acting as a barrier to spilled contaminants. Boom is also used to 
gather oil on the water to improve the recovery effectiveness of skimmers in containment 
and response, and burn efficacy in in-situ burning operations. Boom deployment information 
should include the type of boom deployed (solid boom, fire boom [used in conjunction with 
in-situ burning], sorbent boom and snare boom), boom configuration, and the location of 
the deployment. In some cases, such as the use of solid flotation curtain boom that is 
towed for the purpose of concentrating oil for skimmer recovery, the information 
requirements would include links to the vessel tracks for the towing vessels. As boom is 
sometimes recovered from a location and re-deployed, information relating to retrieval of the 
boom should also be gathered, if possible. 

Dispersant applications 
Dispersants accelerate the natural decomposition of oil, dispersing it from the surface of a 
body of water into the water column. Dispersants can quickly and effectively minimize the 
impact of oil on animals present at the surface, including birds and coastal plant life such as 
mangroves.  

All dispersant applications must be closely tracked in a spill response due to the 
environmental considerations of, and the potential health impact on the personnel involved 
in, dispersant deployment. Additionally, the type of dispersant used in a spill response must 
be closely managed and monitored as dispersant products approved in one country or 
region may not be approved in another.  

Additional information that is dependent on the application method may be required. 
Specifically, the application methods to be considered include:  

• Aerial dispersant application 
• Surface and sub-surface dispersant application 
• Shoreline application 

Hesco Basket & Sand Bag Deployment 
Hesco baskets, named after the company that makes them, look like wire trashcans lined 
with fabric. The baskets can be quickly positioned and filled with sand to provide shoreline 
protection from oil spill residue. 

Operational/response information in the COP portfolio should include tracking of Hesco 
basket installations (and re-installations if the baskets are later moved to a different location). 

Sand bag deployments should also be tracked in similar fashion, to identify shoreline or 
other locations that have been protected from oiling by the installation of sand bags. 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

51 

In-situ burning 
In-situ burning, or ISB, is a procedure sometimes used as a remediation technique in an oil 
spill. In-situ burning involves the controlled burning of oil that has spilled, at the location of 
the spill. When conducted properly, in-situ burning significantly reduces the amount of oil on 
the water and minimizes the adverse effect of the oil on the environment. In addition, in-situ 
burning may avert or reduce the extent of shoreline impacts, including exposure of sensitive 
natural, recreational, and commercial resources. 

Operational/response information in the COP system should include tracking of in-situ 
burning operations, capturing available in-situ burn monitoring information (such as video or 
photographic imagery of the burn), as well as sampling performed as a result of the in-situ 
burn activity. 

Operations equipment / resource tracking (including AIS) 
Operations equipment and resource tracking is another key requirement during the cleanup 
and remediation efforts in an oil spill response. This functionality should capture information 
about equipment and other assets used as well as the work performed by the respective 
equipment to provide current and historical resource tracking. 

To improve the tracking of operational assets, it is strongly recommended that smart tags 
(such as RFID transmitters) and other supply chain and asset management technologies be 
implemented to facilitate identification and tracking of equipment and asset use. 

The Automatic Identification System (AIS) (see section 4.5.8) is an automatic tracking 
system used on ships and by vessel traffic services (VTS) to identify and locate vessels by 
electronically exchanging information with other nearby ships, AIS base stations and 
satellites. IMO regulation “requires AIS to be fitted aboard all ships of 300 gross tonnage 
and upwards engaged on international voyages, cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage and 
upwards not engaged on international voyages and all passenger ships irrespective of 
size”30. 

AIS transmitters allow the signal, which includes the ship's identity, type, position, course, 
speed, navigational status and other safety-related information, to be automatically 
transmitted to appropriately equipped shore stations, other ships and aircraft, or low orbit 
satellites.  

Other vessels used in the OSR response may need to be fitted with dedicated, active point-
point AIS transmitters. AIS information collection may therefore be utilized to provide current 
and historical tracking of vessels, such as skimmer boats and other vessels, used in oil spill 
response efforts.  

                                                                                                               

30 IMO AIS regulations. See: http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Safety/Navigation/Pages/AIS.aspx  



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project

Accordingly, a standard AIS protocol should be implemented among all vessels and vessel 
traffic services used in the oil spill response effort, which ensures that all vessels are tracked 
continuously with an update frequency of 5 minutes or less and provides information about 
the vessel location, speed, heading (or COG), and identification. As described above, a 
combination of AIS and equipment tracking may be required to ensure all vessels are 
tracked and are visible in the COP. Federation of AIS data feeds within the portal will ensure 
that data is presented in a single map layer to the users. 

Operations cleanup (SCAT / STR) 
Shoreline Cleanup and Assessment Technique (SCAT) is a well-defined and documented 
process used in performing surveys of an affected shoreline in an oil spill incident. SCAT 
uses standardized terminology to collect information on shoreline impact due to oiling and 
provides support for operations directors evaluating priorities for shoreline cleanup. 

During the operational phase of an oil spill response the SCAT process will be used to 
review existing shoreline, define boundaries or segments of shoreline, and assign teams and 
conduct surveys of the shoreline sections. Reports from the SCAT process are used to 
develop cleanup plans and subsequently monitor the effectiveness of the cleanup process. 

Collection and reporting of SCAT surveys is an essential part of the spill response process, 
and all planning, surveys, and reporting of the SCAT process should be managed within the 
COP system. 

Personnel tracking  
The safety of the general public and responders is assigned the highest priority during spill 
response operations. Within the COP, personnel tracking must be implemented to properly 
ascertain any potential health risks and exposures to responders in a spill incident. For 
example, detailed records should be maintained for all personnel involved in the delivery of 
dispersants or exposed to residue from in-situ burning activities. Increased information 
gathering and collection regarding personnel, the activities they perform, and any potential 
health-related exposures from their activities can significantly reduce the long-term risk and 
liability to responsible parties involved in a spill incident. 

Restricted areas 
To facilitate operations planning the COP should track areas designated as restricted, 
including flight restrictions over the operations area, as well as restrictions of marine vessels 
to operate in areas adjacent to the spill origin, commonly implemented for safety reasons. 

Sorbent materials 
Sorbent materials, including organics, inorganics, and synthetic materials such as 
polypropylene, may be used to recover oil in situations that are unsuitable for other recovery 
techniques. Operational/response information in the COP system should include tracking of 
sorbent materials used in the cleanup of a spill, as the sorbent materials present a waste 
disposal issue after use. Information relating to the type of sorbent used (bulk, enclosed, 
continuous, or loose) as well as the material (organic, inorganic, or synthetic) should be 
tracked, along with the location(s) and disposal methods utilized for the sorbent materials. 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations

Skimming operations 
The primary method utilized for recovery of oil in a marine-based spill is the use of skimming 
equipment. Typically recovery is accomplished using booms to collect oil, with the skimmer 
recovering and storing the oil for later processing or disposal. Within the COP, tracking of 
skimmer operations and their performance should receive high priority. In addition, the 
information collected should include the volume of oil recovered and details relating to the 
disposition of the recovered fluids. Ideally, in the tracking of vessels used for skimming 
operations, the prevailing conditions such as wind, currents, and sea levels should be 
monitored, as this information can be useful in evaluating the performance of skimming 
operations in varying conditions. 

Response sampling & monitoring 
Response sampling & monitoring information represents an array of information collected 
during the operations phase of an oil spill response. This information may include any or all 
of the following types of sampling information: 

• Conductivity, temperature & depth information, collected by vessels during response 
activity 

• Dissolved oxygen information 
• Fluorometer information, which identifies the presence and amount of oil in water 

through light wavelength analysis 
• Sediment sampling information (fingerprinting) 
• Location information, indicating sampling zones and buffer areas (including wellhead 

buffer) 
• Seafood sampling 
• Snare sentinel monitoring & analysis 
• Sorbent probe observations, in which probes are deployed from vessels and absorb 

subsurface oil if present 
• VIPERS analysis information, which collects samples in trawl nets to determine if 

suspended or submerged oil exists 
• Water quality sampling information 

For further information, refer to OSR-JIP Work Package 1 reports. 

Closures (fisheries, etc.) 
Closures information represents areas designated as closed to commercial and/or 
recreational activities, and subsequent re-openings. Typically this information would include 
any of the following: 

• Fishery closures and re-openings 
• Shrimping, crabbing, shellfish closures and re-openings 

Closure information may exist at varying governmental levels, including national and 
state/province level. 

Community support 
Community support includes the following: 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

54 

• Administrative centers – operator offices in the surrounding area that may be used to 
provide administrative support for the spill response. 

• Claims centers – locations of operator claims centers offering assistance to individuals 
and organizations affected by the oil spill. 

• Community outreach centers – locations of operator centers designated to 
disseminate information and provide a meeting location for communities affected by the 
spill incident.

COP Services Viewpoint  
Funneling information to the COP for users 
A COP provides a variety of information to properly inform users about the status of a 
response. The COP information is managed by the Response Center and funnels potentially 
vast amounts of information into an intelligible and actionable view of the incident. The 
Response Center ingests multiple streams of information about the situation from a 
multitude of sources. Processing and decisions made in the Response Center create the 
dynamic view that is the COP. The COP is delivered by the Response Center to users on a 
variety of platforms: desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.  

Key steps in the workflow for COP creation and release process (Figure 14) are addressed 
in the remainder of this viewpoint: 

• Displaying the COP to users through a geospatial dashboard 
• Data services for delivering the COP to users and supporting COPs 
• Spatial analysis services 
• Request, ingest and validate data sources into the Response Center  
• Disconnected user operations (including maps and loading data on mobile devices)

composite of several displays of information. Each of these information displays are 
described in the following paragraphs: 

• Information resources query and selection 
• Map display including multiple layers and symbols 
• Video display from remote cameras directly viewing some portion of the incident 
• Graphical display (including histograms and other charts) 

Variations on display of information will vary greatly, e.g. ranging from small format screens 
with a single display type to a wall of several screens with multiple, simultaneous displays.

The information in the displays of a dashboard may come from many different remote 
servers. 3D displays may also be provided to the user. 

 

Figure 15  An example of an oil spill response COP geospatial dashboard 

Source: Esri, 2014 

Figure 15 shows an example of a dashboard for an oil spill response COP including: 

• Top center – Map of the response site including:  
o Features of interest displayed using a chosen set of symbols. 
o Representation of real-time queried data, i.e. AIS feeds displayed as tracks.  
o All ships, within an area of interest (AOI), are being updated to the right of the 

map. 
• Upper left – Layers in the map provided as a list. 
• Middle left – Detail about a specific feature shown in the map. 
• Middle right – Graphical display of real-time information. 

o The graphical half-moon display represents pressure readings from the capping 
stack. 

• Bottom – Real-time video display of the spill location including location awareness. 

Information resources query and selection 

The user is provided with controls to choose which information is displayed and how e.g. 
symbol set. A set of map templates can be listed or individual datasets may be listed. A user 
interface to query a catalogue service of datasets and services may also be provided. 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

58 

The user must be provided with a pre-established set of information as a COP. For 
example, the OGC Web Services Context Document can be used for a preconfigured set of 
map layers for a specific geographical area of interest.  

Map viewer 

A map viewer is a display of a projected, symbolized set of geographic information. Controls 
on a map display can include the selection of map layers, pan and zoom of the spatial area 
displayed, and the selection of different symbol sets in the maps. Information in a map layer 
may originate from cartographic maps, vector features, raster imagery, and model outputs, 
e.g. trajectories. Map information may come from local storage or from remote servers via 
web services. Symbols and styles for map display may come from a local storage or from 
remote symbol registry servers. 

Minimum specifications for the map viewer content include: 

• Map scale bar and inverse scale 
• North arrow 
• Coordinate reference system 
• Cursor coordinate tracking 
• Measurement of distance and areas 
• Choice of map template 
• Map layer manipulation/selection, adjust order of map layers, add new layers 
• Bookmarks to navigate to previously defined locations (e.g. the incident or a port or 

cleanup area) 
• Zoom in/out, pan and reset 

Video display 

Display of real-time and recorded video of key sites of the incident can be a key aspect of 
the COP, particularly with the Response Center and the planning team. The sites may 
include offshore platforms, drill ships, ROVs, docks, support vessels, and onshore field 
sites. Video streams can be provided from video servers. The video display may include 
options for pause, rewind, and fast-forward of the video. Video overlay shall include source, 
date/time and location. 

Graphical display 

Graphical displays can include time histories or other statistical displays of physical 
parameters relevant to the incident. Examples include graphical display of real-time 
information such as telemetry, pressure, or other sensor outputs.

Web services for delivering the COP 
Service-oriented architecture 

Figure 16 identifies the recommended COP services and interfaces based on best practices 
and open standards. The architecture in this section is based on operational and 
development systems that deliver a COP for OSR using open standards. Packaging the 
services into components is addressed in the Deployment Viewpoint section of this 
document.  

 

Figure 16  COP service-oriented architecture 

 

Web mapping services  

Web map services dynamically produce spatially referenced maps, portraying geographic 
features for retrieval by the user client dashboard. A map service provides operations to 
retrieve a description of the maps offered by a server, retrieve a map, and query a server 
about features displayed on a map.

The OGC Web Map Service (WMS)31 standard, also published as ISO 19128, provides three 
operations (GetCapabilities, GetMap, and GetFeatureInfo) in support of the creation and 
display of registered and superimposed map-like views of information that come 
simultaneously from multiple remote and heterogeneous sources. 

The OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)32 standard provides for serving spatially referenced 
tile images with predefined content, extent, and resolution. WMTS trades the flexibility of 
custom map rendering – as provided by WMS – for the scalability possible by serving a fixed 
set of tiles.  

Typical open standard encoding formats for maps include: JPG, TIFF, PNG, etc.  

The OGC Keyhole Markup Language (KML)33 standard defines an XML grammar used to 
encode and transport representations of geographic data for display in an earth browser. 
KML encodes what to show in an earth browser and how to show it.  

Servers for geographic features and coverages 

The OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)34 standard, also published as ISO 19142, allows a 
client to retrieve and update geospatial data encoded in Geography Markup Language 
(GML) and other encoding formats. WFS defines interfaces for data access and 
manipulation operations on geographic features. Via these interfaces, a user client can 
combine, use and manage geodata from different sources. Open standards for encoding 
feature data include GML, JSON, and KML.  

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS)35 standard supports electronic retrieval of 
geospatial data as "coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing 
space/time-varying phenomena. WCS provides access to coverage data in forms that are 
useful for client-side rendering, as input into scientific models, and for other clients. Open 
standards for encoding coverage data include NetCDF, HDF, GRIB, BUFR and GeoTIFF. 

Map portrayal and symbols 

While it is preferable that a single set of symbols are used for maps in an incident, this is not 
always possible depending on the organizations involved in the response. Maps in the COP 
may need to be portrayed in symbols chosen by the user. Examples of cartographic 
symbols standards are listed in the COP Information Viewpoint section. 

The OGC Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD)36 standard explains how WMS can be extended to 
allow user-defined symbolization of feature and coverage data. The standard defines how 
the Symbology Encoding (SE) standard can be used with WMS. SLD allows for user-defined

layers and named or user-defined styling in WMS. If a WMS is to symbolize features using a 
user-defined symbolization, the source of the feature data must be identified. WMS servers 
using feature data are also called Feature Portrayal Services (FPS), while those using 
coverage data are Coverage Portrayal Services (CPS). 

The OGC Symbology Encoding (SE)37 standard specifies the format of a map-styling 
language for producing geo-referenced maps with user-defined styling. SE is an XML 
language for styling information used to portray feature and coverage data. SE may be used 
together with SLD. As SE is a grammar for styling map data independent of any service 
interface specification, it can be used flexibly by a number of services that style geo-
referenced information or store styling information that can be used by other services. 

Video streaming and management 

Video images can provide unique real-time and historical awareness of an incident. As part 
of the COP, video is delivered to the user using web services and encodings using open 
standards. Provisioning for the network and processing requirements must be 
accommodated; these are addressed in the Deployment Viewpoint section of this 
document.  

The COP user interface and web services should provide the following functions: 

• Viewing controls (play, pause, stop controls for video display) 
• Query of video library (including search by keyword and tags) 
• Selection of video streams for display 

Media management by the Response Center includes: 

• Media personnel assisting in cataloging and handling of video data 
• Secure transfer of the hard drive media from offshore to onshore 
• Professional editing and annotation of operations videos 
• Archival of video feeds 

The interface between the Response Center and the COP clients should be based on 
Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) standards. Multiple formats may need to be 
supported. 

Context document for the COP 

A COP contains a set of information collected for an incident. In order to manage and 
deliver the assembled set of information an OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS 
Context)38 can be used. An OWS Context can be created by the Response Center for 
deploying the COP to users. The OWS Context contains a manifest of the COP contents.

38 OGC Web Services Context Document. See: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/owc 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

62 

The COP contents may be stored directly in the OWS Context file or the Context may 
contain references to remote resources. Multiple encoding formats for OWS Context have 
been developed (ATOM, JSON). User clients open the OWS Context, retrieve the 
information, e.g. map layers and display the COP in their dashboard displays. 

Map templates can be encoded in OWS Context. Such OWS Context documents for map 
templates can be created in advance as templates. The templates are then completed 
during the time of the response using the specifics of the incident, e.g. spatial location. 

Catalogue services 

Catalogue services (also sometimes called registry services) provide interfaces to discover, 
browse, and query metadata about data, services, and other potential resources. The OGC 
Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) is a binding defined in the OpenGIS Catalogue 
Services Implementation Standard (CAT)39. (An OGC OpenSearch Geo standard is nearing 
adoption as OGC standard and is applicable as well.)  

ISO 19139 - an open standard for the encoding of geospatial metadata – is compatible with 
CSW. 

Authentication and authorization services  

Procedures and protocols must be established to ensure information security. Inadequate 
information security can result in the untimely, inappropriate, and piecemeal release of 
information, which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding and can compound already 
complicated public safety issues. 

Individuals and organizations that have access to incident information and, in particular, 
contribute information to the system must be properly authenticated and certified. This 
requires services to ensure users can be properly authenticated and information flow can be 
properly authorized and protected. 

User management services provide the authentication and authorization capabilities in a 
service oriented architecture. Authentication protocols and user management protocols for 
the purpose of user registration, user single sign-on (SSO), and user data access and use 
metrics are to be established. 

OGC User Management for Earth Observation Services Best Practice40 describes how user 
and identity management information may be included in the protocol specifications for 
OGC Services. The use cases addressed make reference to EO services, for example 
catalogue access, ordering and programming.

Spatial analysis services in the Response Center 
In an incident response a good deal of on-the-fly analysis capability is required to deal with a 
very fluid changing situation. Although certain established products can and should be 
prepared as templates, there is also a need for interactive modeling and analysis skills within 
the team. The Response Center needs to be able to respond to unexpected analysis 
workflows in order for a COP to be successful.  

Operators in the Response Center should be able to assess incoming data including 
images, together with supporting meteorological, oceanographic and ancillary information 
(e.g. AIS, vessel detection) where available, to identify the current and predicted situation. 
This analysis is provided to assist in planning the response.  

Data analysis including image interpretation functions can and should be automated as 
much as possible to improve the efficiency, objectivity and speed of delivery of information 
to the COP. For example, oil spill extents can be detected and delineated automatically from 
satellite imagery. The Geomatics Unit should work with the data providers, e.g. image 
providers, to analyse the auto-interpreted results, not the imagery itself (except for 
verification purposes). 

 
Inputs to the Response Center 
Summary of inputs to the Response Center 

The Response Center will receive data from a variety of sources. Each data feed has its own 
considerations for receiving, storing, and processing data before potential delivery to users. 
Subsequent sections address the ingestion of the data from the variety of sources into the 
Response Center: 

• Base map and reference information sources 
• Meteorological data sources 
• Observations of the spill from surveillance systems 
• Observations of the spill from field workers 
• Modeling and prediction of the spill 
• Tracking of Resources for Spill Response 
• Social media monitoring about the spill 

The sources of information coming into the Response Center are diverse. Planning in 
advance using an Information Management Plan approach is recommended. Advance 
planning must take into account the interoperability of the COP with diverse systems from 
multiple sectors: government, commercial, etc. 

 
 



IPIECA–IOGP Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Project 

64 

Basemap and reference information sources 

Base maps and reference layers may come from many sources: government data, 
commercial map providers, or from responsible party.  

Government data is readily available from spatial data infrastructures (SDI). While each 
country implements their SDI in differing ways, the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure 
“Cookbook”41 provides recommendations that have been implemented widely.  

Specific examples of SDIs include: 

• In the United States:  Geospatial Data.gov 42 and the Geospatial Platform43  
• In Europe: INSPIRE Portal for access to national datasets44  
• The United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information 

Management (UN-GGIM) has been established to promote common principles, 
policies, methods, mechanisms and standards for the interoperability and inter-
changeability of geospatial data and services45  

Commercial maps from public sources may be relevant to a response. Considerations for 
access to commercial map include: 

• The maps may only be available using proprietary interfaces. 
• Map projection may be limited to one projection which may not be suitable for use in 

the response. 

Responsible parties may also have licensed data from geospatial information providers that 
is relevant to the response. Licensing issues will need to be considered when ingesting such 
data into the COP; for example some providers may prohibit the distribution of the 
proprietary data on public web services. 

Meteorological data sources 

Meteorological data may come from many sources: government data, commercial map 
providers, or from the responsible party. Radar on platforms in remote locations may be one 
potential source of meteorological data specific to the incident response.

Observations of the incident from surveillance systems  

Surveillance of the spill may be conducted using a variety of sensor technologies located on 
a variety of platforms. An ocean spill, for example, will require both in-water surveillance and 
above-water surveillance inputs to the COP. 

Real-time and near-real-time sensing of the spill incident provides situational awareness for 
the Response Center. Examples include video from ROVs and images from remote sensing 
instruments on airborne and space-borne platforms. To be useful the sensor data must 
typically be processed and interpreted by experts. The resulting derived products may then 
be made part of the COP. Suppliers of the information as well as the Response Center will 
process the sensor observations. The processing and workflow history, i.e. the provenance 
of the information, must be understood and retained. 

An example scenario of a geographic imagery acquisition is provided in Figure 17 (from ISO 
19101-246). The Response Center requests geographic information derived from image 
acquisition. The request for geographic imagery information is assessed in the planning 
step. The desired information may be available from an archive or a model. Some additional 
processing may be needed on the archive or model outputs in order to meet the customer’s 
request.

The acquisition request for geographic imagery may require the collection of new imagery. 
Tasking determines the available sensors and platforms and develops an imagery 
acquisition request. The sensor is tasked to acquire the raw data and the acquisition is 
performed. Acquisition of the imagery data is done in accordance with the acquisition 
policies.  

Whether the customer’s request is to be satisfied from an archive holding, a model output, 
or a data acquisition, typically some type of additional processing is needed. This could 
range from changing the encoding format of the imagery to creating derived imagery or 
image knowledge products. The resulting imagery information may be applied with 
additional information to form a response that meets the customer’s needs. Distribution of 
the imagery information response is done in accordance with the distribution policies.  

It is important to understand that imagery acquisition takes time. Two durations are 
significant: 

• Image lead-time – time from when the Response Center transmits an acquisition 
request until the time the sensor acquires the image. A significant portion of this lead-
time is required for tasking (tasking is typically carried out at fixed times during the day 
and so will involve some lead time). 

• Image latency – time from image acquisition by the sensor to delivery of the imagery-
derived information to the Response Center. Image latency consists of: time to transmit 
the image from sensor platform to the processing center and the time for image 
processing and delivery. 

It is recommend that the term “acquisition time” be avoided because this is ambiguous – it 
can mean the time taken for the sensor to acquire the data which is not synonymous for the 
time taken for the image to be recorded and then downlinked at the ground station. 

The Response Center must manage the imagery acquisition for the incident including 
potential and planned acquisitions: 

• Potential acquisitions –what is on standby (e.g. airborne platforms and sensors with 
appropriate permissions and accessibility) or feasible (satellite acquisitions that meet the 
imaging requirement) both with lead and latency times considerations in place. In effect 
a resource for tactical planning and avoiding delays - the resource has been provided in 
advance. Other platforms and sensors could be added to the resource during the event 
opportunistically. 

• Planned acquisitions - what is scheduled to be available (which will change frequently). 
This might include planned flight paths, image coverages, etc. (routine as well as 
custom). This is a resource for planning of additional acquisitions - avoiding redundancy 
or coordinating multi-sensor observations. Also includes any "free" data that might be 
available routinely (e.g. Sentinel-1 SAR). 

The Response Center may form a service level agreement with remote sensing suppliers to 
help manage image acquisitions.

Web services for the observation request process by the Response Center can be achieved 
using open standards:   

• The OGC Ordering Services for Earth Observation Products47 supports ordering of EO 
data products either from previously identified dataset collections via a typical catalogue 
interaction or from future acquisitions specified via a programming service. The service 
describes an interface that can be supported by many data providers (satellite 
operators, data distributors, etc.), most of whom have existing (and relatively complex) 
facilities for the management of these data. 

• The OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS)48 implementation standard defines a web 
service interface for requesting, filtering, and retrieving observations and sensor system 
information. Observations may be from in-situ sensors (e.g. water monitoring devices) 
or dynamic sensors (e.g. imagery from Earth-observation satellites).  

• The OGC Sensor Planning Service (SPS)49 implementation Ssandard defines an 
interface to task sensors or models. Using SPS, sensors can be reprogrammed or 
calibrated, sensor missions can be started or changed, simulation models executed 
and controlled. The feasibility of a tasking request can be checked and alternatives may 
be provided. The OGC SPS Earth Observation Satellite Tasking Extension50 supports 
the programming process of Earth Observation (EO) sensor systems used by many 
satellite data providers. 

Two work packages of the Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Process (OSR-JIP) have 
developed recommendations regarding observations from surveillance systems. Reports 
from the WPs provide additional guidance on surveillance inputs to the Response Center:  

• WP1 - In-Water Surveillance: Detection of hydrocarbons in the water column  
• WP2 - Surface Surveillance: Satellite, aerial observation, in-situ sensors 

OSR-JIP WP2 has published a report titled: ‘An Assessment of Surface Surveillance 
Capabilities for Oil Spill Response using Airborne Remote Sensing’, dated 21 May 2014. 
The key findings are as follows:  

• The number of platform and sensor providers is very large, and the number identified 
through the report, particularly platform providers, is limited. A directory of this 
information would be very useful to the industry.  

• Exercises would help considerably in supporting the development of effective airborne 
surveillance capabilities for oil spill response, for technology testing, migration to 
operational capabilities, training, integration with the COP, etc.  

• Effective oil spill response based on opportunistic availability of platforms (with sensors) 
is not viable.

• Given that oil spill surveillance using opportunistically available platforms and sensors is 
not viable, there is a need to build surveillance capabilities around local jurisdictions and 
physical environments for OSR.  

• Unmanned Aerial Systems are clearly going to be important platforms for OSR in the 
future, with the market likely to expand rapidly in the next 5 years. The industry should 
ensure that it is ready to exploit this technology effectively, which requires keeping a 
close eye on developments over the next few years, both technical and regulatory.  

• Standard sensor packages on standby for deployment are potentially very useful, but 
only if their deployment can be provided with necessary approvals in advance (for 
example, export and import-compliant, and approvals for sensor mounts).  

• A technology road map would be useful to identify critical technologies that the industry 
needs for effective oil spill response. Important research topics include: spectroscopy; 
full polarization imaging radar; effective and practical deployment of, and fusion of 
information from, multiple sensors and real time, or near real time, data transmission.  

• Training is a critical part of effective airborne surveillance for OSR, particularly as the 
complexity of sensors, and their greater use in combination (perhaps also with multiple 
platforms), becomes more frequent.  

• Experience from Deepwater Horizon and elsewhere has demonstrated that processing 
of data can delay ingestion of the information into the COP. The drive to develop new 
sensors and data analysis techniques should not obscure the strong requirement to 
enable information to be available rapidly for responders.  

• In order to achieve rapid processing and delivery times, on-platform processing of data 
should be considered to reduce data volumes for remote delivery from airborne 
platforms to decision-makers, and airborne platform external communications 
capabilities should be considered central to the effective use or remote sensing.  

• It will be very important for airborne surveillance to be compatible with the COP in terms 
of products. There may be implications for products from some sensors in terms of 
metadata, time stamping, positioning accuracy, codes, symbology, units, naming, 
delivery mechanisms and formats.  

• Remote sensing creates large datasets, which require proper management not only for 
OSR itself, but for post-event analysis.  

• Synergies between airborne and satellite derived information have to be established and 
relevant case studies prepared.  

Observations of the incident by response personnel  

Data collected by response personnel deployed in the field must be ingested into the 
Response Center database. The methods for workers to send information to the Response 
Center will be highly varied, including applications on smartphones or similar handheld 
device, emails to the Response Center and notes on paper delivered to the Response 
Center. 

Applications on mobile devices can utilize location information available in the device to 
record the location when an observation is made. Prior to deployment the mobile device 
can be configured with COP information, e.g. base maps and best current estimates of spill 
impact as in the field, it is likely that the observations will be made while disconnected, i.e. 
no cellular or other communications. Upon returning to a location with communications, an

69 

upload of the fieldwork observations (including location information) should then be 
uploaded to the Response Center. Upon ingestion at the Response Center, analysis of the 
field observations will be made for confirmation and inclusion in the COP updates.  

The Disconnected Users section below provides recommendations for the support of 
disconnected response personnel operations, including provisioning of mobile units and 
printing maps from COP information. 

Modeling and Prediction of the Spill 

Modeling of an oil spill as part of the response can be split into two different types:  

• Modeling of the trajectory of an oil spill / plume. 
• Metocean modeling of wave currents and winds that supports plume modeling. 

The Response Center may request oil spill drifting services (hindcast and forecast) from 
different oil spill models. The model can simulate the impact of an oil spill for a time period 
(for example 72 hours) according to the specifics of the oil spill and the oceans/weather 
conditions. Access to the models, e.g. using OGC Web Processing Services (WPS) or FTP, 
can return the outcomes of the modeling in two type of formats: CSNDC oil spill schema51 
or netCDF52.  

The integration of metocean data (currents, winds, ice cover, temperature, visibility, 
precipitation etc.) is a challenge as it is generated and held by a wide range of private 
companies and public agencies. The data is available in a wide variety of formats, primarily 
formats used by the Earth & Ocean Sciences community such as GRIB, NetCDF, HDF and 
a variety of ASCII and other non-standard conventions.  

Some of the challenges in delivering metocean data include symbolization and the display of 
scalars (e.g. temperature) and vectors (e.g. current speed and direction). The use of WMO 
standards for representation of wind (barbs) and standard vector representations for 
currents is recommended. 

Work Package 3 of the Oil Spill Response Joint Industry Process (OSR-JIP) has developed 
recommendations regarding modeling and prediction of the spill. The WP3 report, focused 
on Modelling & Prediction, provides additional guidance on surveillance inputs to the 
Response Center.

Tracking of resources for oil spill response 

Many resources are needed for oil spill response including personnel and equipment. 
Tracking the location and the status of these resources is vital to the planning, logistics and 
operations management of the response and thus is key information for the COP. 

Tracking of people includes current and previous deployment locations, deployment tasks 
and any health and safety implications resulting from the deployment task (e.g. exposure to 
dispersants, or poor weather conditions). Several commercial software applications are 
specifically designed for the tracking of human resources. Outputs from these applications, 
including geospatial information, can be provided as inputs to the COP. 

Tracking of assets and equipment, e.g. small boats and boom, includes their location and 
operational status. Tracking of assets and equipment can be automated using RFID or 
similar tagging along with associated information systems. 

For ships, tracking can be performed using Automatic Identification System (as previously 
discussed). Web delivery of AIS to the Response Center can be an input to the COP. 
Historical tracks of AIS may be stored by the Response Center. 

Social media monitoring about Spill 

Social media is a recent phenomenon that can inform oil spill response, particularly if the 
spill is in an area close to people. Attention must be paid to monitoring, filtering and 
confirming social media reports as part of including them in the COP information.  

Use of social media for response operations is a new capability and not yet well understood. 
Multiple research projects and studies are focused on the subject and, in particular, on the 
topic of “Volunteered Geographic Information” (VGI). An example is the research reported by 
the OGC Testbed-10 VGI Engineering Report53. The report describes an approach for 
integrating VGI into a spatial data infrastructure and reports on findings studying the 
advancements made in using VGI resources. It includes optimization ideas, service change 
recommendations, and lessons learned.

Disconnected user operations 
Mobile unit provision 

COP users with mobile devices may be disconnected from communications for extended 
periods of time. Before deployment the mobile device is provisioned with COP information. 
During deployment the COP information is used in the operation; the applications used 
must be able to support queries on the COP while disconnected. Disconnected users may 
record updates to geographic features that can be later provided to the Response Center 
once reconnected. The Response Center will then need to consider whether to use these 
modifications to update the COP. 

To equip a mobile device with a ‘ready-to-use’ COP before deployment, the previously 
mentioned OWS Context standard can be used to define views on the COP. To provide the 
underlying information for the COP while disconnected, the OGC GeoPackage54 standard 
can be used to provision the mobile device with features, tiles and other geo-information. 
OWS Context and GeoPackage were designed specifically to provide situational awareness 
for disconnected users. 

Printed map capability 

The COP will likely need to produce large-format printed maps at regular intervals, and thus 
printing/plotting facilities will need to be available at the Response Center. Standard map 
templates ensure that the map meets minimum technical standards and provides clear and 
unambiguous cartographic symbols. In addition the maps should be saved as snapshots in 
a reproducible format, such as PDF, and archived as part of the record retention process.  

In order to present the geospatial information to the end users in a coherent fashion, a 
series of map templates will be required. These should provide selected sets of information 
for specific purposes (as previously discussed in Map Templates). Such map templates 
should be available to be printed as large-format wall maps and for maps that can be taken 
on deployment operations by disconnected users. 

The minimum map contents should include: 

• Map frame with annotated grid and graticule 
• Coordinate reference system 
• North arrow 
• Map scale and scale bar 
• Legend describing all features in the map content 
• Map title, security classification, author, date 

  
                                                                                                               

54 OGC GeoPackage. See: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geopackage 

• Unique map reference number 
and version  

• Index map 
• Intended map print size 
• Date and time the map was 

created

COP Deployment Viewpoint 
Preparing for deployment before the incident 
The Deployment Viewpoint identifies the types of COP components needed to support the 
deployment and management of distributed interaction between the components. 
Components defined in the Deployment Viewpoint are implementations of the services, 
interfaces, and encoding identified in the Services Viewpoint. The COP components provide 
the persistent storage and management of the data identified in the Information Viewpoint.  

Prior to the response, multiple organizations will implement various instances of the COP 
components. At the beginning of the response, a challenge for response team is to quickly 
assemble these components into an operational COP platform. This challenge is eased by 
the architecture defined in this section: a reusable interoperable architecture with 
standardized interfaces that will facilitate efficient data sharing during a response event.  

The process to deploy a COP for a response should consider these elements: 

• COP components should be “ready-to-go” and agreed in advance.  
• Some components used in a response will be used in day-to-day operations. 
• Data required for the response should be considered in advance. 
• Drills and exercises should be used to test and train for the COP. 
• The COP components must conform to open standards, common enterprise IT, and 

utilize web-computing frameworks.  
• Some of the components should be developed as open-source to enable development 

options.  

The component deployment architecture for a Tier 3 Response is shown in Figure 18. The 
individual component layers (client, Response Center, and sources) along with the 
intervening networks (client networks and source networks) are detailed in the following 
sections. 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations

Figure 18  COP component deployment architecture  

The Response Center will need some amount of computer system hardware to establish 
the deployment architecture. With the increasing availability, accessibility and afforability of 
remote resources, e.g. cloud computing, the Response Center may rely on the remote 
hosting and computation of certain functions, such as database management and file 
storage, if sufficient security measures can be put in place. The use of remote resources, 
and in particular cloud computing, has multiple benefits that should be taken into account 
when deploying for response. These include: 

• Scalability (i.e. good for both big and small disasters) 
• Data upload from various remote locations (i.e. no need to deliver data to the command 

center) 
• Data processing power and speed (i.e. increase by a factor of 10 at least) 
• Data storage (almost limitless storage capacity, pay as you go) 

Clients 
The public client layer will include a diversity of hardware platforms, e.g. mobile, desktop, 
and websites, that can be developed and launched on a multitude of operating systems 
(e.g. Android, iOS for mobile / tablet; Windows, Linux for tablet / computer) (see Figure 19).

Figure 19  Diversity of deployment platforms  

 

Client networks (including security) 
The Response Center must connect to networks to allow access by components in the 
public client layer.  

A public internet connection with bandwidth to support public access to the public COP 
must be available. 

Security at both network level (e.g. firewalls) and application (e.g. authentication and 
authorization services) must be implemented before the COP hosts any data. 

 
Response Center components 
The Response Center will contain the following components: 

• Portal to provide dashboard access to users including maps, video, displays, etc.  
• Portal provides access to continuously updated incident-specific information through: 

o Data collection and gathering of incident information  
o Review and collating of incident information  
o Analysis and synthesizing of incident information  
o Publishing and disseminating  

• Geographic Information System (GIS)  
• Surveillance planning and ingest  

o Including feasibility analysis for observations and receiving data from sensors 
without loss, e.g. streaming 

• Analytic processing to support Response Center analysis 
• Video handling and storage 

o Data recording and media management 



Common Operating Picture: Recommendations 

 

75 

o Live streaming video to clients 
o DBMS and file storage 

• Response Center clients 

Any of the components listed above could be hosted on computers physically located at the 
Response Center or hosted at a remote location, e.g. via cloud hosting. If hosted remotely, 
secure networking with sufficient reliability and performance needs to be procured. 
Consideration for physical redundancy of the Response Center should also be considered.  

Source networks 
Source networks will need to include:  

• Networks internal to the Response Center, e.g. Wi-Fi router. 
• Dedicated communications to response assets, e.g. offshore network services. These 

may be wired or wireless communications. 
• Public Internet may be used for the Source Networks.  

The security considerations for the source networks must also be addressed. 

Source layer components 
Source layer components are generally at locations physically separate from the Response 
Center. These will include: 

• Surveillance sensors and platforms. 
• Predictive models hosted at remote compute facility. 
• Asset tracking systems, e.g. RFID readers and communications. 
• Public sources of information, including spatial data infrastructures, information from 

relevant governments, met/ocean information, AIS for vessel tracking, social networks, 
e.g. Twitter, and other sources. 

• Field worker platforms for disconnected operations and field collection.

 The dataset usage sum

m
ary table show

s the follow
ing for each dataset:  

1. 
C

ategory – Either base m
ap or incident. Refers to w

hen the data is generated. 

2. 
D

ataset – A general type of data e.g. streets, ESI, w
ildlife refuge. 

3. 
D

ataset detailed – Specific dataset nam
es, often already existing som

ew
here, e.g. N

ational M
arine Fisheries Service regions. 

4. 
C

ategory – W
hether it is basem

ap data or incident data - included tw
ice to assist w

ith sorting and categorization (B=basem
ap, I=incident). 

5. 
Priority –The relative priority of the dataset  (H

=H
igh, M

=M
edium

, L=Low
). 

6. 
Land/Sea/Both –W

hether the dataset is required for terrestrial incidents, m
arine incidents (specifically at sea), or both (L=land, S=sea, B=both). 

7. 
Lifecycle – Lifecycle stage (P=plan, C

=collect, U
=use). These colum

ns are used as follow
s: 

• 
Plan – Refers to the need to identify w

here the data is com
ing from

. Ensure that a place has been created for it in a database, shapefile, etc., and a 
plan for collecting the data in a tim

ely fashion exists. 

• 
C

ollect – Actually collect the data. For m
ore volatile data, the collection effort is either m

ore frequent or during the actual spill, as data collected during 
a drill w

ill be stale by the tim
e it is needed. If a colum

n contains a “C
,” a prior phase in the lifecycle should have a “P” (not alw

ays, but typically). 

• 
U

se – The data is actually used during this phase.
