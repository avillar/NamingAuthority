Source: z CSIRO 
  
Work item code: z   Date: z 2008-08-25 
     
Category: z B   
  

Use one of the following categories: 
F  (Critical correction) 
A  (corresponds to a correction in an earlier release)

C  (Functional modification of feature) 
D  (Editorial modification) 

Detailed explanations of the above categories can 
be found in the TC Policies and Procedures. 

 
 

  
Reason for change: z A GML 3.2 binding of the O&M schemas is required for applications that wish to 

use the current version of GML 3.2. It is also necessary to underpin an orderly 
revision process for O&M, in which implementation specifics are handled 
separately from functional changes.   

  
Summary of change: z 1. Add ANNEX D "GML 3.2 XML Schemas for O&M Sampling Features" 

containing the schema documents in the accompanying zip document 
Proposed namespace http://www.opengis.net/sa/1.0/gml32  
Dependencies 

- GML 3.2 http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2  
- Metadata http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd

- O&M Core http://www.opengis.net/om/1.0/gml32  
 

  
Consequences if  z 
not approved: 

1. GML 3.2 applications incompatible with O&M 
2. Confused process for functional upgrades
