Preface

This document provides the set of revision notes for the existing GeoPackage version 1.2.1 (OGC 12-128r15) and does not modify that standard.




This document was approved by the OGC membership on approval date. As a result of the OGC Standards Working Group (SWG) process, there were a number of edits and enhancements made to this standard. This document provides the details of those edits, deficiency corrections, and enhancements. It also documents those items that have been deprecated. Finally, this document provides implementations details related to issues of backwards compatibility.

1. Introduction



1.1. Scope


GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information.




Over the course of 2017 and 2018, the GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) made a number of changes to the GeoPackage Encoding Standard Version 1.2 (OGC 12-128r14). These changes have been aggregated into version 1.2.1 of the GeoPackage Encoding Standard (12-128r14). This document describes those changes.




GeoPackage 1.2.1 is a corrigendum revision to version 1.2.0. An OGC Corrigendum release is focused on correcting errors, bugs, and/or deficiencies. While a corrigendum release can break backwards compatibility (such as correcting a schema error), the SWG has worked hard to ensure that this corrigendum does not break backwards compatibility. In this case none of the changes alter conformance requirements.




All changes were all managed via the GeoPackage GitHub repository. All substantive issues and most administrative issues were raised in the GitHub Issue Tracker and discussed by the SWG. Once the issue was resolved, a pull request was generated and merged into the repository. Some administrative issues such as typos were corrected directly through a commit on the master branch.

5. Description of Critical Changes



There are no critical changes in this release.








6. Description of Substantive Changes



6.1. Removing erroneous part of trigger (Annex F.3)


The update3 trigger for the RTree Spatial Index extension needs to have the “of ” portion struck. As originally written, the update3 trigger will only fire when the geometry is actually updated because of the “of ” clause – the key action this trigger is designed to handle is when the ID is changed – it can also deal with a geometry change at the same time – but as written will not fire if only the ID is changed.




This change does not introduce any risks to interoperability. However, by issuing this correction, we prevent an problem that could arise in the field and would be hard to debug. There have not been any reports of this problem in the field to date because most SQLite applications never change the internal id value of an existing row.




The executable test suite for GeoPackage has been updated to accept either the original or corrected version of the trigger for GeoPackage versions 1.2.0 and earlier. Versions 1.2.1 and later are required to use the corrected trigger.




6.1.1. Original Trigger



CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update3 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> != NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;








6.1.2. Corrected Trigger



CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update3 AFTER UPDATE ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> != NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;










6.2. Updating R140, R141, and R145 to indicate required rows and column values (Annex F.8, F.9, and F.10)


One intent of the GeoPackage Encoding Standard was for GeoPackage contents (particularly tables) to be self-discoverable. Some tables are defined by the core standard, some tables are user defined (and therefore described by gpkg_contents), and some are added as part of extensions. In GeoPackage 1.2.0 and before, the way to describe tables added as part of extensions was not clearly specified. In the OGC GeoPackage Extension for Tiled Gridded Coverage Data, each required table is explicitly identified in the gpkg_extensions table. This change was made to apply this same technique consistently across extensions. This is a largely cosmetic change that will not have any impact on interoperability.










7. Future Work



There is no future work for this document being planned at this time. However, the GeoPackage SWG may wish to produce another version of the GeoPackage Encoding Standard if warranted.
