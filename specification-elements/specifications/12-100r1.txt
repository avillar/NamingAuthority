OGC 12-100r1  

Introduction 

Coverages represent digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying 
phenomena. OGC Abstract Topic 6 [OGC 07-011] – which is identical to ISO 19123 – 
defines an abstract model of coverages. Coverage instances may be encoded using the 
GML Application Schema – Coverages (GMLCOV) version 1.0 [OGC 09-146r2] which 
is based on the Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.2 [OGC 07-036], an 
XML grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application schemas as 
well as the transport and storage of geographic information. 
This profile of GMLCOV specifies the usage of the GeoTIFF data format for the 
encoding of GML coverages. It is based on the authoritative format specification 
available as GeoTIFF Format Specification which in turn is based on the TIFF 
specification. 
 

This encoding is used by several OGC services like the Web Coverage Service (WCS) 
2.0 Interface Standard – Core [OGC 09-110r4].

4 Terms and definitions (normative) 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in the above references 
(in particular: GML AS – Coverages [OGC 09-146r2]) apply. 

4.1 raster or image space 

Space used to reference the pixel values in a grid or image (cf. GeoTIFF format 
specification [GeoTIFF]). 

4.2 model space 

Space used to reference points on the earth (cf. GeoTIFF format specification 
[GeoTIFF]). 

5 Overview and conventions 

5.1 Overview (informative) 

The GeoTIFF format specification [GeoTIFF] extents the basic raster file format TIFF 
specification [TIFF] with georeferencing information using reserved TIFF tags. In doing 



OGC 12-100r1 

10   Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

so the GeoTIFF format is fully compliant with the TIFF format. Thus software incapable 
of reading and interpreting these extension TIFF tags is still able to open a GeoTIFF 
format file by simply ignoring them. 

A TIFF file is composed of the Image File Header (IFH) and one or multiple Image File 
Directories (IFDs) holding the actual data entries in 2D rectangular arrays of pixels. 

Thus, the only coverage types supported by this specification are 
gmlcov:GridCoverage, gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage, 
gmlcov:ReferenceableGridCoverage, and any coverage type derived thereof 
with exactly 2 dimensions. Although techniques to store 3D or even higher dimensional 
coverages in TIFF files are known they are not considered herein. 

For coverages of type gmlcov:GridCoverage the GeoTIFF format specification is 
not needed and simple TIFF files are used instead. However, this profile still applies. 

Following the notation of the abstract coverage definition in the GML AS – Coverages 
[OGC 09-146r2] the domainSet is limited to 2 dimensions and the rangeType is 
limited according to the TIFF specification. 

5.2 Namespace prefix conventions 

The following namespaces are used in this document. The prefix abbreviations used 
constitute conventions used here, but are not normative. The namespaces to which the 
prefixes refer are normative, however. 

Table 1 – Namespace mappings 

Prefix Namespace URI Description 
xsd http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema XML Schema namespace 
gml http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2 GML 3.2.1

wcs http://www.opengis.net/wcs/2.0 WCS 2.0 

 

5.3 Multiple representations 

When multiple representations of the same information are given in a specification 
document these are consistent. Should this not be the case then this is considered an error, 
and the XML schema shall take precedence. 

6 GeoTIFF coverage representation requirements class 

Requirements class geotiff-coverage establishes how coverages are represented in the 
GeoTIFF encoding format. It further specifies how coverages can be requested e.g. from 



OGC 12-100r1  

a WCS by defining parameters for TIFF features like compression, tiling, etc. Its 
identifying URL is given by http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV_geotiff-
coverages/1.0/req/geotiff-coverage. 

6.1 General 

Coverages using GeoTIFF encoding shall follow both the TIFF and the GeoTIFF 
specifications. 

Requirement 1 /req/geotiff-coverage/tiff-specification: 
A GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall follow the TIFF specification [TIFF]. 

Note GeoTIFF encoded coverage instances may additionally follow one or more of the 
TIFF extensions [BigTIFF], [TIFF-TN2], [TIFF-TN], or [TIFF-TN3]. 

Requirement 2 /req/geotiff-coverage/type: 
A GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall be of type gmlcov:GridCoverage, 
gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage, or gmlcov:ReferenceableGridCoverage,  
or a subtype thereof. 
Dependency: http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/conf/gml-coverage 

Requirement 3 /req/geotiff-coverage/geotiff-specification: 
A GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance and being of type 
gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage, or gmlcov:ReferenceableGridCoverage, 
or a subtype thereof shall follow the GeoTIFF specification [GeoTIFF] and shall contain 
the geo-referencing information of the coverage. 

Note Coverages with type gmlcov:GridCoverage only need to adhere to the TIFF 
specification. 

6.2 GeoTIFF identification 

The GeoTIFF format shall be identified by the following URI or MIME type identifier, 
whenever a format identifier is required. 

Note Extensive examples are available online at the same place as the accompanying XML 
schemas. 

Requirement 4 /req/geotiff-coverage/uri: 
If the usage of URIs is possible GeoTIFF encoding of a coverage shall be indicated by 
the following URI: 
 http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV_geotiff-coverages/1.0/conf/geotiff-coverage 

Note Examples include the value of the xlink:role attribute of the 
gml:rangeParameters element in multipart GML coverage instances, or the ows:Profile 
element in WCS GetCapabilities responses. 

Requirement 5 /req/geotiff-coverage/mime-type-identifier: 
GeoTIFF encoding of a coverage shall be indicated by the following MIME type 



OGC 12-100r1 

12   Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

identifier: 
 image/tiff 

Note MIME sub-type image/tiff is defined in [RFC-3302]. 

Note Examples include the value of the Content-Type header in service responses, the 
formatSupported element in WCS GetCapabilities responses, the nativeFormat element in 
WCS DescribeCoverage responses, or the format parameter in WCS GetCoverage requests. 

6.3 Mapping between GeoTIFF abstract model and GML AS abstract model 

6.3.1 Domain 

Requirement 6 /req/geotiff-coverage/dimensions: 
The domain of a GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall have exactly 2 dimensions. 

Requirement 7 /req/geotiff-coverage/crs: 
The coordinate reference system identified by the value of the srsName attribute of the 
gml:Envelope element of the gml:boundedBy element of a GeoTIFF encoded 
coverage instance shall be the same as the coordinate reference system used in the 
GeoTIFF part. 

Note The value of the srsName attribute of the Envelope element shall be inherited by all 
directly expressed geometries (see GML 3.2 [OGC 07-036] clause 9.10), i.e. for all range set 
values encoded in GeoTIFF. 

Note “The coordinate reference system used in the GeoTIFF part” depends on the coverage’s 
type. For the type gmlcov:RectifiedGridCoverage this is obvious, for the type 
gmlcov:ReferenceableGridCoverage this is the coordinate reference system used for the 
tiepoints, and finally for the type gmlcov:GridCoverage the coordinate reference system is 
limited to raster or image space ones anyway and thus “the GeoTIFF part” is in fact a pure TIFF 
part only. 

Note GML 3.2 [OGC 07-036] does not define any concrete ReferenceableGrid and the 
ones added by Change Request OGC 07-112r3 are not suitable for usage with GeoTIFF encoding. 
Thus a new suitable one, e.g. ReferenceableGridByGCPs, is going to be proposed but will 
only be available in future. 

Requirement 8 /req/geotiff-coverage/axis-ordering: 
The value ordering of a GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall adhere to the axis 
order of the coordinate reference system identified by the value of the srsName attribute 
of the gml:Envelope element of the gml:boundedBy element. 

Note This applies to all elements directly bound to a coordinate reference system i.e. the 
boundedBy, origin, and offsetVector elements but not to elements in raster or image space 
i.e. the grid. 

Requirement 9 /req/geotiff-coverage/pixel-is-area: 
The domain of a GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall respect the coverage’s raster 
space as defined in the GeoTIFF specification [GeoTIFF] i.e. PixelIsArea or 
PixelIsPoint. 



OGC 12-100r1  

Note The definition of grids in GML 3.2 [OGC 07-036] clause 19.2.2 which GMLCOV is 
based on reads as: “When a grid point is used to represent a sample space (e.g. image pixel), the 
grid point represents the center of the sample space (see ISO 19123:2005, 8.2.2).”. 

Note GMLCOV does not store the raster type i.e. PixelIsArea or PixelIsPoint 
information in its current version. However, Requirement 9 above specifies that the 
gml:boundedBy element shall respect the raster type i.e. it shall include the half pixel border in 
case of PixelIsArea (see also Figure 1) but not in case of PixelIsPoint. In other words, in 
case of PixelIsArea the gml:boundedBy element is decreased by the half of both 
gml:offsetVector elements in the gml:lowerCorner coordinate and increased by the half of 
both gml:offsetVector elements in the gml:upperCorner coordinate compared to the case 
of PixelIsPoint. The gml:origin element stays the same independently of the raster space. 

Examples: The following XML fragments show the boundedBy and the domainSet elements 
describing the domain of sample coverages respecting the axis ordering of the used CRS:

6.3.2 Range 

Requirement 10 /req/geotiff-coverage/range-ordering: 
A GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance with more than one component in the rangeType 
shall order the components of the coverage’s rangeType in the same order as given in the 
gml:rangeType element’s document order. 

Note The order of components, also called bands, within a composite rangeSet value 
corresponds to document order of the rangeType elements. 

6.4 GeoTIFF parameters 

6.4.1 Request 

The following GeoTIFF parameters are defined for requesting GeoTIFF encoded 
coverages for example via WCS GetCoverage requests. 

Note It is always possible for a given coverage instance to determine its current parameter 
values, i.e., the parameter values used at creation. Thus a GeoTIFF encoded coverage is self-
describing. 

Requirement 11 /req/geotiff-coverage/parameters-xml: 
The structure of an XML request requesting a GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall 
be extended as defined in Table 2 and the respective XML Schema being part of this 
standard. 

Requirement 12 /req/geotiff-coverage/parameters-kvp: 
The structure of a KVP request requesting a GeoTIFF encoded coverage instance shall be 
extended as defined in Table 2 where the parameter names shall be prefixed with 
"geotiff:" for example geotiff:compression. 

Note This prefix is used as namespace replacement in order to minimize the risk of reusing 
already defined KVP parameters.
