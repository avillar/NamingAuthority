Introduction 

The OGC netCDF encoding supports electronic encoding of geospatial data, specifically digi-
tal geospatial information representing space and time-varying phenomena. 

This document specifies the netCDF core; every netCDF encoding shall adhere to the manda-
tory requirements as specified in this standard.  

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a data model for array-oriented scientific data. 
A freely distributed collection of access libraries implementing support for that data 
model, and a machine-independent format are available. Together, the interfaces, librar-
ies, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of multi-dimensional scientific 
data. 

NetCDF data is intended to make possible the creation of collections of data that are: 

• Self-Describing: A netCDF dataset may include descriptive information about the 
data they contain.  Hence a netCDF dataset may constitute a complete and inde-
pendent unit with no need for external metadata. 

• Portable: Computers with different ways of storing integers, characters, and float-
ing point numbers can access netCDF data.  

• Direct-access: A small subset of a large data set may be accessed efficiently, 
without first reading through all the preceding data.  

• Appendable: Data may be appended to a properly structured netCDF file without 
copying the data set or redefining its structure.  

• Sharable: One writer and multiple readers may simultaneously access the same 
netCDF file. Using parallel netCDF interfaces, multiple writers may write a file 
concurrently.  

• Archivable: Access to current and earlier forms of netCDF data will be supported 
by current and future versions of the software.  

The purpose of netCDF is to provide a data model, software libraries, and machine-
independent data format for geoscience data. Together, the netCDF interfaces, libraries, 
and format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data. With suitable 
community conventions, netCDF can help improve interoperability among data provid-
ers, data users, and data services.

OGC Abstract Specification: NetCDF Core 

1 Scope  

This OGC standard defines the netCDF data model and the core set of requirements to which 
every netCDF encoding must adhere.   Extensions to the NetCDF core standard add further 
functionality to the core requirements.  In particular, netCDF extensions to the core are re-
quired for specific encodings, such as the 64-bit Offset Format. This document indicates 
which extensions, at minimum, need to be considered in addition to the core for creating  
useful standards that can be implemented to meet interoperability requirements of domains 
and information communities. 

2 Conformance 

Standardization targets are netCDF implementations (currently: encodings).  

This document establishes a single requirements class, core, of  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core  

with a single pertaining conformance class, core, with URI  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/conf/core.  

Requirements and conformance test URIs defined in this document are relative to  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/. 

Annex A (normative) specifies conformance tests which shall be exercised by any encoded 
dataset claiming to implement an OGC netCDF encoding. 

3 Normative references 

The OGC NetCDF Core standard consists solely of this document.  

The complete standard is identified by OGC URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0.

4 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in the above references 
apply. In addition, the following terms and definitions apply. 

4.1 attribute 

Attributes hold metadata. An attribute contains information about properties of a variable or 
an entire dataset.  The usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6.

4.2 coordinate variable 

A coordinate variable is a variable that identifies a coordinate axis. 

4.3 data 

The ISO definition of data is the reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized 
manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing [ISO/IEC 2382-1]. 

4.4 data model 

A data model is a description of the organization of data in a manner that reflects an informa-
tion structure [ISO/IEC 11179-1]. 

4.5 data type 

According to ISO, the definition of a data type is the specification of a value domain with 
operations allowed on values in this domain [ISO 19103].  The usage of this term in the con-
text of netCDF is given in Chapter 6. 

4.6 data value 

According to OGC Observations and Measurements, a data value is the result of a specialized 
event called an observation. An observation is an act of observing a property or phenomenon, 
with the goal of producing an estimate of the value of the property [OGC 07-022r1].  

4.7 dataset 

According to ISO, a dataset is an identifiable collection of data [ISO 19101]. 

4.8 dimension 

Dimensions are used to specify variable shapes, common grids, and coordinate systems.  The 
usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6.  

Note that certain specifications of common grids and coordinate systems are done in netCDF 
conventions which are beyond the scope of this netCDF core specification and are part of 
extension specifications. 

4.9 domain 

A domain is a well-defined set [ISO 19103]. 

4.10 encoding 

An encoding is a conversion of data into a series of codes [ISO 19118]. 

4.11 global attribute (dataset attribute) 

Global attributes apply to a whole data set and may be used to record properties of all the 
data in a file, such as processing history or conventions used.

OGC 10-090r3 
 

4.12 grid 

A grid is a network composed of two or more sets of curves in which the members of each 
set intersect the members of the other sets in an algorithmic way [ISO 19123]. 

Note that certain specifications of common grids and coordinate systems are done in netCDF 
conventions which are beyond the scope of this netCDF core specification and are part of 
extension specifications. 

4.13 metadata 

Metadata is data about data [ISO 19115]. 

4.14 model 

A model is an abstraction of some aspects of reality [ISO 19109]. 

4.15 netCDF 

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a data model for array-oriented scientific data, a 
freely distributed collection of access libraries implementing support for that data model, and 
a machine-independent format. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and format support the 
creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.   

The classic model represents information in a netCDF data set using dimensions, variables, 
and attributes, to capture the meaning of array-oriented scientific data. 

Note that this document is the specification of the netCDF classic data model.  The formal 
requirements are given in Chapter 6. 

4.16 netCDF conventions 

The mere use of netCDF is not sufficient to make data "self-describing" and meaningful to 
both humans and machines. The names of variables and dimensions should be meaningful 
and conform to any relevant conventions. Dimensions should have corresponding coordinate 
variables where sensible. 

Conventions provide a mechanism whereby a community can specify standard ways to repre-
sent quantities and coordinate systems within the simple framework provided by netCDF, 
using only dimensions, variables, attributes, and a limited set of six primitive types.   

Note that the specification of conventions is not covered in the core netCDF specification, 
but is left to be done in extension specifications. 

4.17 record 

A record is a finite, named collection of related items (objects or values). 

The usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6. 

10 
 



OGC 10-090r3 
 

4.18 record dimension (unlimited length dimension) 

In the netCDF classic model, at most one dimension can have the unlimited length, which 
means variables can grow along that dimension. Record dimension is another term for an 
unlimited dimension. 

The usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6. 

4.19 shape 

The shape of a variable is specified with a list of zero or more dimensions. 

The usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6. 

4.20 variable 

A variable has a name, type, shape, attributes, and values.  In face, much of the netCDF 
specification consists of defining the specific characteristics of variables. Variables hold 
data values.  In the netCDF model, a variable can hold a multidimensional array of values of 
the same type. 

The usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6. 

4.21 variable attribute 

Variable attributes record the properties of one variable. 

The usage of this term in the context of netCDF is given in Chapter 6. 

4.22 NetCDF-specific definitions 

The following table lists the definitions specific to the context of this specification.  They are 
all of definition type “property.” The base URI to be used with the tokens is:

5 Document Conventions 

5.1 UML notation 

All the diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) static structure diagram, as described in Subclause 5.2 of OGC Web Ser-
vices Common [OGC 06-121r8]. 

5.2 Data dictionary tables 

The UML model data dictionary is specified herein in a series of tables. The contents of the 
columns in these tables are described in Subclause 5.5 of [OGC 06-121r8]. The contents of 
these data dictionary tables are normative, including any table footnotes. 

5.3 Namespace prefix conventions 

Since there are no XML schemas used in this specification, there are no namespace map-
pings. It is possible that extensions may involve schemas, in which case the namespace map-
pings will be listed in those specification documents. 

6 NetCDF classic data model 

This Clause specifies the underlying data model for a netCDF classic dataset used in the fur-
ther Clauses of this standard.  

6.1 NetCDF classic model overview 

The classic model represents information in a netCDF data set using dimensions, vari-
ables, and attributes, to capture the meaning of array-oriented scientific data. Figure 1 
presents a UML diagram of the classic data model.

6.2 NetCDF classic data model UML notation 

 

Figure 1: netCDF classic data model 

For a more comprehensive explanation of the netCDF data model, see the NetCDF User's 
Guide[1] or the online NetCDF Workshop for Developers and Data Providers [3]. 

Requirement 1 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/data-model-elements: 

NetCDF classic datasets shall represent information using dimensions, variables and attrib-
utes using the primitive data types as shown in the UML diagram in Figure 1. 

6.3 Primitive data types 

Requirement 2 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/primitive-data-types: 

Variables and attributes shall have one of six primitive data types: char, byte, short, int, float, 
double. 

6.4 Variables 

Variables hold data values. In the classic model, a variable can hold a multidimensional 
array of values of the same type. A variable has a name, type, shape, attributes, and val-
ues. The shape of a variable is specified with a list of zero or more dimensions: 

• 0 dimensions: a scalar variable with only one value. 

• 1 dimension: a 1-D (vector) variable. 

• 2 dimensions: a 2-D (matrix or grid) variable. 

 13
© 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 



OGC 10-090r3 
 

• ... 

• N dimensions: a N-D (matrix or grid) variable. 

A variable may have zero or more variable attributes. 

Requirement 3 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/variable-name-type-
value: 

A variable shall have a name, type, and data values. 

Requirement 4 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/variable-shape: 

The shape of a variable shall be specified with a list of zero or more dimensions. 

6.5 Dimensions 

Dimensions are used to specify variable shapes, common grids, and coordinate systems A 
dimension has a name and a length. Dimensions may be shared among variables, indicat-
ing a common grid. Dimensions may be associated with coordinate variables to identify 
coordinate axes. In the classic model, at most one dimension can have the unlimited 
length, which means variables can grow along that dimension. Record dimension is an-
other term for an unlimited dimension. (In the enhanced model, multiple dimensions can 
have the unlimited length.)  

Note that certain specifications of common grids and coordinate systems are done in netCDF 
conventions which are beyond the scope of this netCDF core specification and are part of 
extension specifications.  Likewise this core specification is confined to the netCDF classic 
data model so the specification of the enhanced model is left to an extension specification. 

Requirement 5 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/dimension-shapes: 

Dimensions shall specify variable shapes which may be shared as common grids. 

Requirement 6 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/dimension-name-
length: 

A dimension shall have a name and a length. 

Requirement 7 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/record-dimension: 

At most one dimension (the record dimension) shall have unlimited length 

6.5.1 Attribute 

Attributes hold metadata.  An attribute contains information about properties of a variable 
or an entire data set. Variable attributes may be used to specify properties such as units. 
Attributes that apply to a whole data set, also called global attributes, may be used to re-
cord properties of all the data in a file, such as processing history or conventions used. An 
attribute may have zero, one, or multiple values (1-D), but attributes cannot be multidi-
mensional. 

14 
 



OGC 10-090r3 
 

NetCDF conventions are defined primarily in terms of attributes. Thus the names of at-
tributes are typically standardized in conventions rather than the names of variables. 
NetCDF conventions are specified in extensions to this core specification. 

An attribute may have zero, one, or multiple values (one dimensional). 

A netCDF dataset may have zero or more global attributes. 

Requirement 8 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/global-attribute-
metadata: 

Global attributes shall hold metadata about the entire dataset.  

Requirement 9 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/variable-attribute: 

A variable attribute shall hold metadata about one variable. 

Requirement 10  http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/core/attribute-dimension: 

An attribute shall have at most one dimension.

Annex A: Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative).  

A netCDF encoding must satisfy the following characteristics to be conformant with this 
specification.  Note, however, that an encoding extension is needed in order to actually im-
plement executable tests corresponding to these abstract tests.    

A.1 Conformance Test Class: netCDF Core 

Applies for conformance class netCDF with URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/conf/core 

A.1.1 Requirement 1 

Test ID Conformance Test for Requirement 1 

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/conf/core/data-model-elements: 

Test 
purpose 

NetCDF classic datasets shall represent information using dimensions, vari-
ables and attributes using the primitive data types as shown in the UML dia-
gram in Figure 1. 

Test 
method 

Open the dataset and check that it represents information using dimensions, 
variables and attributes using the primitive data types as shown in the UML 
diagram in Figure 1. 

A.1.2 Requirement 2 

Test ID Conformance Test for Requirement 2  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/conf/core/primitive-data-types 

Test 
purpose 

Variables and attributes shall have one of six primitive data types: char, byte, 
short, int, float, double. 

Test 
method 

Open the dataset and check that all variables and attributes have one of six 
primitive data types: char, byte, short, int, float, double.

Test 
method 

Open the dataset and check that, for any variable for which there is a shape, the shape  is 
specified with a list of zero or more dimensions. 

A.1.5 Requirement 5 

Test ID Conformance Test for Requirement 5  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/conf/core/dimension-shapes 

Test 
purpose
