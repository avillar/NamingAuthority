i. Preface 

This document describes the procedures used by the OGC Naming Authority for the 
assignment and registration of OGC names.   

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the normative terms (SHALL, SHOULD, etc) defined in Subclause 
5.3 of [OGC 06-121r3], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2: Rules for the 
structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not 
“must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to comply 
with this specification. 
Name production rules in this document are expressed using ABNF (IETF RFC 5324).

OGC Naming Authority - procedures 
1 Scope 

The OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) controls the assignment of OGC Names to 
resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. In the terminology defined 
in ISO 19135, OGC-NA is the Control Body for the register of OGC Names. This 
document describes the framework of documents, registers and other resources required 
for OGC-NA to execute that role.  
The scope of the resources that may be identified with OGC Names is indicated by the set 
of items in the register http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/type/ . 
Prior to 2010 OGC Names were generally URNs. Following a decision of the OGC 
Technical Committee at the Silver Spring plenary in June 2010, all subsequent OGC 
Name assignments use the http URI syntax described in this document and in other Name 
Type Specification policy documents adopted by OGC1.

3 Naming rule 

3.1 OGC name schemes 

Two URI schemes [IETF RFC 3986] are used by OGC to provide persistent names for 
resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. A http URI scheme [IETF 
RFC 4395] provides persistent identifiers which may also be directly resolved to resource 
representations using the standard web infrastructure, in particular the DNS system. A 
URN scheme [IETF RFC 2141] was used prior to 2010 to provide equivalent identifiers 
which do not imply location or a specific resolution mechanism.  
Http URI and URN schemes use different delimiters for the elements within the identifier 
('/' and ':' respectively). Rules for the names that allow either form to be composed from 
the same elements requires that the elements use a reduced character set which excludes 
both of these delimiters.  

Note: The URN scheme is essentially identical to that described in version 1 of this 
policy. The ABNF description below has been revised for consistency with [IETF RFC 
3986] and to accommodate the URN/URI consideration above. Although the rule here 
excludes some identifier forms that may have previously been valid, in practice no 
assignments were made using the characters now excluded so there is no backward 
compatibility problem.  

The following ABNF adapted from [IETF RFC 3986] provides some basic definitions 
required in the rest of this document, and in other OGC-NA policy documents:  
	  	  	  segment	  	  	  	  	  	  	  =	  *pchar	  

	  	  	  segment-­‐nc	  	  	  	  =	  *pchar-­‐nc	  

	  	  	  segment-­‐nz	  	  	  	  =	  1*pchar	  

	  	  	  segment-­‐nz-­‐nc	  =	  1*pchar-­‐nc	  

	  	  	  pchar	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  =	  unreserved	  /	  pct-­‐encoded	  /	  sub-­‐delims	  /	  ":"	  /	  "@"	  

	  	  	  pchar-­‐nc	  	  	  	  	  	  =	  unreserved	  /	  pct-­‐encoded	  /	  sub-­‐delims	  /	  "@"	  

	  	  	  pct-­‐encoded	  	  	  =	  "%"	  HEXDIG	  HEXDIG	  

	  	  	  unreserved	  	  	  	  =	  ALPHA	  /	  DIGIT	  /	  "-­‐"	  /	  "."	  /	  "_"	  /	  "~"	  

	  	  	  reserved	  	  	  	  	  	  =	  gen-­‐delims	  /	  sub-­‐delims	  

	  	  	  gen-­‐delims	  	  	  	  =	  ":"	  /	  "/"	  /	  "?"	  /	  "#"	  /	  "["	  /	  "]"	  /	  "@"	  

	  	  	  sub-­‐delims	  	  	  	  =	  "!"	  /	  "$"	  /	  "&"	  /	  "'"	  /	  "("	  /	  ")"	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  /	  "*"	  /	  "+"	  /	  ","	  /	  ";"	  /	  "="	  

3.2 Use of name structure 

The naming schemes defined by OGC-NA in this and related documents have a regular 
structure. The structure is primarily to provide the name provider (OGC) with a 
mechanism to govern the names and ensure uniqueness. While name users (clients) 
might attempt to infer other names based on the structure, the OGC-NA registers are the 
normative source of OGC names.  



OGC 09-046r3 

4 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 

3.3 http URI scheme 

The generic syntax for OGC http URIs is  
	  	  	  URI	  =	  "http://www.opengis.net/"	  OGCResource	  "/"	  ResourceSpecificPath	  

3.4 URN scheme 

The generic syntax for OGC URNs is [IETF RFC 5165] 
	  	  	  URN	  =	  "urn:ogc:"	  OGCResource	  ":"	  ResourceSpecificString	  

3.5 Resource type and Name Type Specification 

OGCResource is a token that indicates the resource type, taken from the register  
http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/type/.  
The special resource types "Resource type", "OGC-NA register" and "Name authority" 
are defined in this document. Each other resource type is defined in an OGC-NA policy 
document known as a "Name Type Specification" (NTS). 
An OGC name for a resource type shall be produced using the following rule: 
	  	  	  OGCResource	  	  	  =	  "type"	  

	  	  	  ResourceSpecificPath	  =	  "ogc-­‐na"	  "/"	  type	  

	  	  	  ResourceSpecificString	  =	  "OGC-­‐NA"	  ":"	  type	  

	  	  	  type	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  =	  segment-­‐nz-­‐nc	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  ;	  a	  token	  from	  the	  register	  of	  OGC	  resource	  types2	  	  

EXAMPLE 1: http://www.opengis.net/type/ogc-na/def  

EXAMPLE 2: urn:ogc:type:OGC-NA:def 

Changes to the register of resource types (addition, deletion, supercession) shall be by 
submission of a proposed NTS to the OGC Naming Authority 
names@opengeospatial.org.  
An NTS shall contain the following: 

(i) A description of a class of resources which may be designated with OGC 
Names,  

(ii) The token to be used as the value of OGCResource  
(iii) A description of the structure of the ResourceSpecificPath and 

ResourceSpecificString for this resource type.  
NOTE: If the ResourceSpecificPath and ResourceSpecificString refer to items 
from other registers, details of these must be provided in the NTS. These 
registers may be controlled by OGC or the OGC-NA, or may be controlled by an 
external authority.  

(iv) Details of any type-specific policies for assignment of OGC Names 
NOTE: This provides the information required for OGC-NA to assess 
requests for registration of names for this resource type.

3.6 OGC-NA Register  

An OGC-NA register is a set of items required for the assignment and management of 
OGC names.  
An OGC URN for an OGC-NA register shall be produced using the following rule: 
	  	  	  OGCResource	  	  	  =	  "register"	  	  

	  	  	  ResourceSpecificPath	  =	  "ogc-­‐na"	  	  "/"	  register	  "/"	  

	  	  	  ResourceSpecificString	  =	  "OGC-­‐NA"	  	  ":"	  register	  	  

	  	  	  register	  	  	  	  	  	  =	  segment-­‐nz-­‐nc	  

EXAMPLE 1: http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/def-type/ 
EXAMPLE 2: urn:ogc:register:OGC-NA:def-type 

OGC-NA registers are created from time to time by OGC-NA for the purpose of managing OGC 
Name assignment.  

3.7 Name authority 

A Name Authority is an organization, specification document or service that is authorized 
by OGC-NA to provide or describe resources of designated resource types or sub-types. 
The set of Name authorities is provided by the register at  
http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/authority/ .  
An OGC URN for a Name authority shall be produced using the following rule: 
	  	  	  OGCResource	  	  	  =	  "auth"	  	  

	  	  	  ResourceSpecificPath	  =	  "ogc-­‐na"	  "/"	  authority	  	  

	  	  	  ResourceSpecificString	  =	  "OGC-­‐NA"	  ":"	  authority	  	  

	  	  	  authority	  	  	  	  	  =	  segment-­‐nz-­‐nc	  

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  ;	  a	  token	  from	  the	  register	  of	  OGC	  Authorities3	  	  	  

EXAMPLE 1: http://www.opengis.net/auth/ogc-na/epsg   
EXAMPLE 2: urn:ogc:auth:OGC-NA:EPSG 

Changes to this register (additions, deletions, supercession) shall be by submission of a 
Name Authority Proposal to the OGC Naming Authority names@opengeospatial.org.  
A Name Authority Proposal shall contain the following: 

(i) A description of, or locator for, the Name Authority 
(ii) The token to be used to indicate this authority where required in an OGC 

Name  
(iii) The resource type(s) (including sub-types where appropriate) that this 

authority is responsible for 
(iv) Details of any authority-specific policies for name assignment (e.g. rules for 

name element variables)

4 Name registration 

4.1 OGC name categories 

An OGC Name may fall into one of the following categories: 
1. an individual name designates a discrete resource, whose description or 

definition has been specified in advance 
 these shall be registered as discrete items in the OGC name register 

EXAMPLE 1: http://www.opengis.net/doc/features  
EXAMPLE 2: urn:ogc:doc:AS:Features 

2. a name set defines a set of names which are constructed when required, according 
to a rule. The resource representation denoted by the name may need to be 
computed when requested 

 these shall be registered as a class, with a description of (or reference to) 
the rule or algorithm for names of this class 

EXAMPLE: http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/si/0/m%2Fs  
EXAMPLE: urn:ogc:def:uom:SI::m%2Fs 

4.2 Submission process 

Name registration is initiated by submission of a proposal to the OGC Naming Authority 
names@opengeospatial.org.  
A name registration submission shall contain the following information:  
Individual names: 

 the identity of the person or organization requesting the name assignment 
 the resource type selected from the register at  

http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/type/ 
 the OGC Name requested 
 one of 

 the locator for the resource 
 for ‘definitions’, an RDF representation of the resource  

 

The name must conform to the rules for names of that type, which may require that items 
are present in dependency registers used in the name production rule for that type.  
EXAMPLE 1:  http://www.opengis.net/doc/wms/1.3.0   
http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/4756   

EXAMPLE 2:  urn:ogc:doc:IS:WMS:1.3.0  http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/4756   

Name sets:

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  

 the resource type selected from the register at  
http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/type/.  

 a template for the set of OGC Names requested, with a variable for each element 
to be populated according to a rule or algorithm 

 the rule or algorithm for populating each variable in the template, including a 
reference to any dependency resource  

 one of: 
o (preferred) a locator for a service that can provide a description of each 

resource in this set  
o one of 

 a locator for a definition of the set of resources  
 a representation of the definition of the set of resources 

The name must conform to the rules for names of that type, which may require that items 
are present in dependency registers used in the name production rule for that type.  
EXAMPLE 1: http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/epsg/0/4326  
 http://www.epsg-
registry.org/indicio/query?request=GetRepositoryItem&id=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326 

EXAMPLE 2: http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/ucum/0/m%2Fs  
 http://aurora.regenstrief.org/~ucum/ucum.html  

Name registration will always involve the addition of items to one or more OGC-NA 
registers. A name assignment request shall attempt to identify all the register changes that 
are required, and shall ensure that the information required for each register conforms to 
the requirements for that register, and shall verify that an OGC name for this resource has 
not already been allocated.   

4.3 Processing of name assignment requests 

As a general principle, the OGC-NA will take a "light touch" approach to acceptance of 
name registration proposals, and it is expected that most proposals will be accepted. The 
principle grounds for rejection of a name registration will be  

1. the resource cannot be obtained using the locator provided 
2. the resource is not of the type indicated 
3. the resource already has an OGC name  
4. the name is not consistent with patterns in use for similar resources 

The OGC-NA will process requests in a timely manner. Most discussion and decisions 
will be made using e-mail.   

5 URN resolution 

Requests for the URN resolver http://urn.opengis.net/ described in RFC 5165 are directed 
to the OGC Definitions Service, which is found at http://www.opengis.net/def/. 
Descriptions of resources that have URN names can be requested by passing the URN as 
the argument to the service using the syntax
