iii. Preface 

The intended target audience is developers that wish to implement CF-netCDF encoding for 
servers and/or clients. This document provides an overview of the many possible components 
of the CF-netCDF suite and how those components fit together into a coherent whole.  This 
document also provides useful hints and best practices beyond the pure standards texts. In the 
era of modular standards, such primer documents are especially important so that potential 
users can get a sense of the overall landscape. 

As such, the content of this document is informative and not normative. 

iv. Terms and definitions 

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r3], 
which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of In-
ternational Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to 
indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

Introduction 

The CF-netCDF standard defines how to encode digital geospatial information representing 
space/time-varying phenomena. 

CF-netCDF consists of a set of normative specifications, collectively referred to as “the CF-
netCDF suite”. These specifications encompass: 

 netCDF Core [OGC 10-090r3] 

 netCDF Classic Binary Encoding Extension Standard: NetCDF Classic and 64-bit 
Offset Format [OGC 10-092r3] 

 As noted in this later in this document, additional Extensions to the Core that may be 
specified in the future.  In particular, submission of a CF-netCDF Conventions Ex-
tension Standard [OGC 10-093] is planned for the near future. 

This document provides an overview on the CF-netCDF encoding suite by describing CF-
netCDF core and extensions. As such, the content of this document is informative and not 
normative.

CF-netCDF Overview: Core and Extensions 

1 Scope  

Scope of this document is to provide a primer on the use of the CF-netCDF suite of stan-
dards. 

2 Conformance 

This Primer document does not contain any normative statements, hence no compliance is 
defined. In case there are any deviations between the standards mentioned and this document 
the standards texts shall prevail. 

3 Terms and definitions 

None defined here. 

4 Normative References 

This Primer document does not contain any normative statements; hence it contains no nor-
mative references. 

5 Conventions 

5.1 UML notation 

All the diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) static structure diagram, as described in Subclause 5.2 of OGC Web Ser-
vices Common [OGC 06-121r3]. 

5.2 Namespace prefix conventions 

None defined here. 

6  CF-netCDF Package Overview 

6.1 Core and extensions 

Based on the CF-netCDF model defined in this document and the NetCDF Classic core data 
model specification, many extension packages are conceivable which: 

• add specific functionality to the NetCDF classic data model and encoding, or 

• constrain aspects of the core NetCDF classic model and encoding.  

The list presented below contains existing, planned, and possible CF-netCDF extensions. It 
makes use of a grouping which appears reasonable at the time of this writing; however, this

OGC 10-091r3 
 

structuring is by no means normative and shall not be used to draw any conclusions on the 
functionality a particular specification provides. 

For illustration purposes, some possible extensions are listed in Section 7. 

NetCDF Classic Core and each extension specify, as normative requirements, which prere-
quisite specifications they require. Frequently, options are possible in some specific group of 
extensions; for example, every netCDF implementation must support at least one encoding 
extension. 

 

Figure 1 —CF-netCDF specification hierarchy graphical overview 

 

This constitutes a dependency graph as shown in Figure 1, where the dark green boxes 
represent the initial targets for standardization and light green are the next targets. 

 

6.2 Application Profiles 

An Application Profile (AP) trims or constrains CF-netCDF functionality for some particular 
purpose. To this end, two mechanisms are available:

OGC 10-091r3 
 

 The AP can make a choice among the extensions it declares mandatory (note that the 
core has to be included in any case). 

Note that there are cross dependencies among some extensions which have to be res-
pected. For example, the core requires at least one encoding extension, and the CF 
Conventions extension requires a Data Sampling Type. 

As an example, a Satellite Imagery AP might require a Swath Data Type whereas 
Forecast Model Output AP requires the Gridded Data Type. 

 Additional restrictions can be imposed on core and extensions.  

In the above example, certain high resolution Model Output APs might required the 
64-bit offset binary encoding. 

Consequently, a conformance test for an AP will in turn inspect the NetCDF Classic Core, 
any extension listed, and finally the specific requirements of the AP in question. 

7 Possible extensions  

In this section, several CF-netCDF extensions are listed which have been discussed by the 
CF-netCDF Working Group in the course of developing the CF-netCDF specification. Some 
of them are already available as adopted or proposed specifications by other groups (NASA 
and NOAA in particular), but nearly all of them are available as part of the netCDF packages 
which have been implemented and used widely for decades.  The CF conventions are in fact 
a separate entity, but they too evolved as part of the netCDF community of practice and were 
initially implemented for use with netCDF. By no means is this list prescriptive or compre-
hensive; some extensions listed here may never be written, and others not listed at this time 
may be added and developed later. 

Following the presentation in Section 6, extensions are grouped into abstract classes: 

 Data model extensions: they extend or refine data structures; 

 Conventions extensions: they constrain the core NetCDF Classic capabilities; 

 Format encoding extensions: they describe encodings applicable for the transfer of 
CF-netCDF objects. 

 Binary, XML, and text encodings specify the structure of the encoded information. 

 APIs specify the way in which application programs invoke the processes that create 
or read CF-netCDF encoded objects. 

These abstract classes will not be standardized and implemented as such, but concrete exten-
sions within the classes will be implemented and standardized.

7.1 Data model extensions 

7.1.1 Purpose 

This category of extensions focuses on adding information content to the netCDF dataset 
model. 

7.1.2 Identification 

The netCDF core specification and each CF-netCDF extension is identified by a unique 
HTTP URI which, by convention, is specified in the first formal requirement of an extension 
specification.  

This primer document is identified by OGC URI http://www.opengis.net/doc/primer/cf-
netcdf/1.0. 

Currently, the CF-netCDF suite of (proposed) standards includes: 

The NetCDF Core Specification.  OGC Document 10-091r3.   This specification is identi-
fied by OGC URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0.  The document has OGC URI 
http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/netcdf/1.0.  

The NetCDF Classic and 64-bit Binary Encoding Extension.  The specification is identi-
fied by OGC URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-binary/1.0. The document has OGC 
URL http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/netcdf-binary/1.0. 

7.1.3 List of extensions 

7.1.3.1 Enhanced netCDF data model 

The netCDF classic data model has been extended by an enhanced model that includes 
“groups,” an expanded list of primitive data types, and a provision for user defined data 
types. 

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html#Data-Model 

7.1.3.2 Other data model extensions 

Other extensions to the core data model may be added later. 

7.2 Conventions extensions 

7.2.1 Purpose 

This category of extensions describes conventions that may constrain the general netCDF 
data model.  Many netCDF conventions have been defined for use in a diverse set of discip-
lines.  Among them are:  

• CF Conventions (Recommended, if applicable) 
• COARDS Conventions (1995 standard that CF Conventions extends  

and generalizes) 
• GDT Conventions (1999 standard that CF Conventions extends and generalizes) 

4 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 



OGC 10-091r3 
 

• CDC Conventions (for gridded data, compatible with but more restrictive than 
COARDS) 

• NCAR-RAF Conventions for Aircraft Data 
• AMBER Trajectory Conventions for molecular dynamics simulations 
• ARGO netCDF conventions for data centers 
• National Oceanographic Data Center NetCDF Conventions 
• NUWG Conventions (1992-1995 effort to create some observational data  

conventions) 

7.2.2 List of extensions 

While it is important to be aware of the fact that many netCDF conventions exist, the initial 
focus of the CF-netCDF SWG is on the conventions for Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata. 

7.2.2.1 CF conventions 

The conventions for climate and forecast (CF) metadata are designed to promote the 
processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF API.  The conventions define meta-
data that provide a definitive description of what the data in each variable represents, and the 
spatial and temporal properties of the data. This enables users of data from different sources 
to decide which quantities are comparable, and facilitates building applications with powerful 
extraction, regridding, and display capabilities.

Proposed NASA CF Standard: 
http://www.esdswg.org/spg/rfc/esds-rfc-021 

7.2.2.2 Other conventions extensions 

Other conventions extensions may be added later. 

7.3 Binary encoding extensions 

7.3.1 Purpose 

This category of extension describes the structure of the encoded datasets. 

7.3.2 List of extensions 

NetCDF encoding formats are defined in format encoding extensions.  Some of these encod-
ings are binary and are to be specified in extensions to the netCDF core.  

Unidata netCDF encoding documentation 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html#Classic-File-Parts 

7.3.2.1 NetCDF classic and 64-bit offset binary encoding formats 

In particular, the first extension is to be the NetCDF Classic and 64-bit Offset File Formats 
which have been previously adopted as a NASA Standard:

7.3.2.2 HDF 5 binary encoding format 

The HDF 5 encoding format is used in conjunction with the netCDF enhanced data model.   
It is no doubt appropriate to have the general HDF 5 encoding format defined by another 
standards group and only define the constraints on its use in conjunction with the netCDF 
data model defined here. 

HDF 5 Encoding for netCDF Enhanced Data Model 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html#NetCDF_002d4-File-Parts 

7.3.2.3 Other binary encodings 

Other binary encoding extensions may be added later. 

7.4 XML encoding extensions 

7.4.1 Purpose 

XML encoding extensions can serve several purposes.  The entire contents of a netCDF data-
set can be encoded in dialects of XML.  But XML dialects can also be used to augment the 
metadata associated with a binary encoded netCDF dataset.  It can also be used to define vir-
tual datasets that consist of aggregations of data that exist in multiple netCDF binary files. 

7.4.2 List of extensions 

This open-ended list is likely to encompass at least ncML and ncML-GML.  It remains to be 
seen whether and how CSML fits with netCDF encoding. 

7.4.2.1 NcML 

NcML Documentation 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/ncml/ 

NcML is an XML representation of netCDF metadata, (approximately) the header informa-
tion one gets from a netCDF file with the "ncdump -h" command. NcML is similar to the 
netCDF CDL (network Common data form Description Language), except, of course, it uses 
XML syntax. The simplest use of NcML is to describe the metadata and structural content of 
a netCDF file.  A more advanced use is to modify existing NetCDF files, as well as to create 
"virtual" NetCDF datasets, for example through aggregation. 

7.4.2.2 NcML-GML 

NcML-GML is: 

• an Abstract and Content Model reconciliation schema for ES and GIS info realms 

• a Mediation Markup Language between ncML (netCDF Markup Language) and 
GML 

6 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 



OGC 10-091r3 
 

• an extension of ncML core schema, based on GML grammar 

  

At the moment, to support some legacy software packages, ncML-GML is not a standard 
GML profile. This will be fixed in a future release.

http://zeus.pin.unifi.it/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=50&Itemid=78 

7.5 Text encoding 

7.5.1 Purpose 

It is often useful to represent the contents of a netCDF file or just the header metadata infor-
mation in a simple, east for humans to read, text form. 

7.5.2 List of extensions 

7.5.2.1 CDL (network Common data form Description Language) 

CDL (network Common data form Description Language) is a tiny language that makes it 
possible to represent either the metadata or the entire contents of a netCDF dataset in an in-
tuitive, easily understandable textual form. 

CDL syntax is described at: 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html#CDL-Syntax 

7.6 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) 

7.6.1 Purpose 

The powerful but relatively simple netCDF APIs are often cited at a primary reason for the 
wide adoption and usage of netCDF.   For that reason, they are seen as a facilitator of intero-
perability of data systems within the community.  Because of that, there have been sugges-
tions that establishing the most commonly used APIs as a standard would greatly benefit inte-
roperability in a wider community.  Hence, they are included here as future possibilities, but 
are not the initial focus of the CF-netCDF SWG.
