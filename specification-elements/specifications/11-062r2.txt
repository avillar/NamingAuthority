Preface 

This document is a deliverable for the OGC Web Services 8 (OWS-8) testbed activity. 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate standards or revisions to existing standards into OGC's Standards Program, 
where they are formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, 
international teams of technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing 
interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC 
Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments 
and interoperability support services - all designed to encourage rapid development, 
testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards. 

The OWS-8 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommend to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-8 initiative be organized around 
the following threads: 

    * Observation Fusion 

    * Geosynchronization (Gsync) 

    * Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 

    * Aviation

OWS-8 CCI Portrayal Registries Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

The OWS-8 Cross Community Interoperability (CCI) thread was built on progress made 
in the recent OWS-7 initiative to cover key technology areas that could not be addressed 
within the scope of that initiative. The OWS-8 CCI thread aimed to increase 
interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, including advancing of 
interoperability among heterogeneous data models, advancing strategies to share styles to 
provide a more common and automated use of symbology, improvement of KML, and 
advancing schema automation allowing communities to better share their information 
artifacts. This OGC engineering report aims to present findings from the portrayal 
registries as part of the CCI subthread 

These guidelines are drawn from lessons learned in the framework of the OWS-8 
initiative environment, which includes multiple OGC service implementations including 
WMS/FPS (Carmenta), WFS (CubeWerx, Luciad, interactiveInstruments),  CSW-ebRIM 
for Services  (Compusult), CSW ebRIM Portrayal Registry (Carmenta), web portal client 
applications (ESRI and Compusult).  The following was the scope of the work, related to 
Portrayal performed at the CIC thread: 

- Develop a CSW ebRIM Profile for Portrayal Registry. 

- Develop a CSW ebRIM interface to the DGIWG Portrayal Registry (to evolve 
into portrayal extension package of CSW ebRIM). 

- Advance the use of SLD documents by creating a link between a SLD document 
in a Get Map Request and SE from the portrayal registry CSW ebRIM interface 
(Reference OGC SLD Profile of WMS Change Proposal 10-181). Intent for this 
extension point is to allow a reference to a rule set ID in a portrayal registry to be 
included in a SLD document. 

- Evaluate and demonstrate if the same style resources could be used for OGC 
Portrayal Services and KML data, i.e. KML and SLD/SE would simply be 
different representations of the same resource. 

- Evaluate the use of portrayal registries within KML. KML features reference 
styles, while OGC Portrayal Service requests reference SLD (containing a set of 
layers with one or more styles). These resources would need to be managed 
consistently in the registry. 

- Improve the portrayal registry service by allowing styles to be accessed from the 
registry using a URL with a fragment identifier to reference the particular 
Style/StyleMap element in the KML document. 

- Improve the portrayal registry service by making the URL above mentioned to be 
persistent - or available at least as long as anyone might reference the particular 
style(s).

- Identify need for extension points to support military symbology, including MIL-
DTL-89045A, GeoSym and MIL-STD-2525C, Common Military Symbology. 

- Develop a small sample set of symbols (SLD/SE and KML) for demonstration 
purposes.

4 Portrayal Registry Models 

4.1 Introduction 

While the concept of a Portrayal Registry is quite long standing, the formalization of the 
concept into a robust standards specification has been elusive. The difficulties in creating 
a Portrayal Registry standard should not be underestimated, and include technical, 
conceptual and even “cultural” issues.  To understand this we need only recall that while 
the first Feature Portrayal Service was demonstrated in OGC Web Mapping Test Bed 1 
(WMT1), a formal  “FPS” specification was not written until 2006.  It took that long to 
understand the differences between FPS and conventional (“legacy”) map servers, and to 
reach agreement on at least a basic model of the portrayal process. Note further that while 
ISO TC/211 19117, was one of the earliest specifications to be discussed jointly between 
the OGC and ISO TC/211, there is still, even today, no broad agreement on a suitable 
reference model for portrayal. 

The Portrayal Registry component of OWS7 showed clearly that the OGC CSW-ebRIM 
specification was an appropriate foundation on which to build a Portrayal Registry, 
however, it did not result in a portrayal registry, i.e. ebRIM extension package ready for 
standardization.  It is hoped that the work in this component, when combined with that of 
other threads making use of ebRIM registries will at least provide a concrete starting 
point. 

One of the objectives of this report is to further illuminate the issues involved with the 
hope of laying the ground work for a formal Portrayal Registry specification that can 
become both an OGC and ISO TC/211 standard. In particular, the Portrayal Registry 
prototype should be built on top of the DGIWG portrayal database. This database does 
not use SE as its internal representation; it is based on the portrayal concepts in ISO 
19117 and adds some registration aspects from ISO 19135. 

One important difference between the DGIWG database and the SE structure is that it 
separates rules from the symbols. This separation is actually quite important for the 
DGIWG use case; it is envisioned that the nations in DGIWG will agree on a common set 
of symbols for (say) topographical maps, and that individual member nations will then 
create rule sets which map these symbols to the (potentially nation-specific) application 
schemas. (Note that symbols refer to here include icons, line styles, text styles and area 
fills.) 

4.2 Overview of Portrayal Process 

This section provides an informal discussion of the Portrayal Process. It is not 
specifically based on either OGC SLD/SE, nor on ISO 19117, but shares elements of 
both. 

The intent of the Portrayal Process is to generate graphical renditions based on 
geographic or geographically related data.  In most cases this means the generation of 
maps, however, other kinds of visual products may be produced. Whether the graphical 
rendition is expressed on paper or delivered only on electronic media will not concern us 
here, other than to note that the introduction of electronic media has greatly extended the 
possibilities of portrayal, including everything from dynamic highlighting and labeling 
(e.g. mouse overs), to the generation of photo-realistic 3D models of buildings and entire 
cities. 



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 10 

In portrayal we assume that we are provided with one or more sources of geographic or 
geographically related data, meaning some collection of encodings of models of real 
world objects, and it is the purpose of portrayal to use this information to create an 
appropriate graphical rendition. So our simplest model of portrayal is as shown in Figure 
1. 

 

 

 

Figure 1: Very Simple Model of Portrayal 

 

The graphical world is distinguished from the model of the real world. We separate the 
presentation (portrayal) from the real world model (content). Typically we have different 
means for encoding models of real world objects, than for the description of the graphical 
objects.  We also avoid the use of terminology like “conversion” since the graphical 
rendition is not a conversion of the geographic world, but rather an interpretation or 
styling. The process of interpreting the encodings of models of real world objects to 
create graphical objects is called styling, and the process of transforming the graphic 
object encodings into something we see on a screen or paper, is called rendering.  
Portrayal is then the composition of Styling and Rendering. 

A canonical example of Figure 1 is the case of encoding models of real world objects in 
GML, styling them to SVG (scalable vector graphics) and then rendering the SVG on a 
monitor screen or piece of paper.  The difficulty of the whole subject of standardizing 
portrayal is underscored by the fact that we might not have universal agreement on the 
meaning of Figure 1, or that it is the essence of portrayal.  Nonetheless this report will 
proceed on that assumption. 

To refine the notion of Portrayal further we need to introduce a way of thinking about 
“models of real world objects”, and for that we will rely on ISO TC/211, 19109, which 
introduces the notion of features or application objects.  This is another slippery slope, 
and we will find very quickly that we will want to distinguish certain kinds of features, 
we call coverages, while other, discrete objects, we are content to call just, features.  
Since this may be confusing, the term “discrete feature” will be used to refer to discrete 
objects (concrete or abstract) such as roads, rivers, buildings, electoral districts or air 
spaces.  The term coverage will be used to refer to features which describe the 
distribution of some quality or quantity over a geographic region and/or in time. 
Coverages include things like sea surface temperature, population distributions, bore hole 
rock extrusions, salinity profiles in the ocean, or temperature profiles in the atmosphere.  
We should not be misled by the fact that the geometry of discrete features are most often 
encoded in so called “vector”  descriptions, while coverages are often described using 
raster or gridded data structures.  The geometry of discrete features could be described 
also using raster or gridded structures (e.g. bit maps or characteristic functions), while 
many kinds of coverages naturally arise from vector structures (e.g. distribution of birth 
rate by country in state of Alabama).

In ISO 19109, features are typed objects (the type has a name) that are characterized by a 
list of properties, the late 20th century incarnation of structuralist philosophy from earlier 
in the century. 

As features are our means of describing the real world, so too, some set of graphical 
objects are used to describe what it is that appears in our graphical rendition.  Typically 
such graphical objects are geometric entities and text, together with visual properties such 
as colour, reflectance, etc. The process of styling can then be seen as one of selecting and 
specifying the graphical objects that will represent particular feature objects. 

Styling is thus the application of rules or functions that map feature objects to graphic 
objects.   

   F: feature   |------------>   graphic object 

The selection and specification of graphical objects (styling) is a made more complex by 
several factors, including: 

1. The!geometry!of!the!graphical!objects!may!be!strictly!related!(e.g.!scaled)!or!strictly!

4.3 Portrayal Registry Issues 

The Portrayal Registry will be based on the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification, meaning 
that it is defined by an ebRIM extension package for portrayal.  Thus all discussion of 
registry objects means ebRIM registry objects. 

While the idea of a Portrayal Registry is quite old, there are many basic issues which 
have not been resolved sufficiently to define a portrayal registry model for a standards 
specification.  These include: 

9. Content:  Should the registry include only symbols or should it include symbols 
and styles (how should style be defined?), and even rendition layer definitions. 

10. Purpose:  Should the registry’s purpose only be to support the 1) 
sharing/discovery of symbol (and style? and rendition layer definitions), or 2) 
construction of styles from style components (such as symbols). 

11. Granularity: How fine grained should the objects in the registry be?   
12. Degree of Abstraction.  Since we have encodings for symbols (e.g. OGC SE, 

SVG, KML etc), how much of the symbol encoding should be exposed through 
the registry objects, and their properties. 

13. Information Hiding:  Can we structure the registry objects so that they can hide 
a number of different encodings with a common set of abstractions?  For example, 
we might have an ExtrinsicObject for a styling rule, with the associated repository 
item holding an encoding of the rule, the nature of the encoding being specified 
by a slot on the ExtrinsicObject.

While it was not done in OWS-7, one could add a slot to the ExtrinsicObjects to indicate 
the encoding of the associated repository item.  For example, in the OWS-7 Portrayal 
Registry, this slot would have the value “SVG” for vector symbols, and “Bit Map” (or a 
specific bit map encoding) for raster symbols.

4.5 Portrayal Registry Model based on OGC SLD/SE 

The OGC SLD 1.1 and SE 1.1 specifications extended the portrayal model to more 
clearly support the concept of a Feature Portrayal Service or so called “Component” 
WMS.  We can thus create an ebRIM extension package based on SE 1.1.1  This might 
look something as follows:

Note that the Symbolizer Classification Scheme (C-Scheme) would appear as: 

 

Figure 4.  Symbolizer Classification Scheme 

Note that there is NO Filter Registry Object.  It is assumed that Filters are not easily re-
used and are thus not registered objects. 

Note that there is an association to a FeatureType (RegistryObject) from the 
FeatureTypeStyle Registry object. This is assumed to be part of another Extension 
Package for features defined in one or more application schema. 

SLD (Styled Layer Description) documents (see OGC SLD 1.1) can also benefit from 
being managed through a Portrayal Registry. A possible set of RegistryObjects for an 
SLD is then as follows:

Editor’s Comment: 

Should there be a single Symbol or Symbolizer ExtrinsicObject together with a 
Classification Scheme, or separate ExtrinsicObjects as shown in Figure 5. 

4.6 Extension Package for Portrayal Registry in OWS-8 

In the aviation thread (CCI) a new Extension Package for a Portrayal Registry was 
proposed by Carmenta based on the DGWIG Portrayal Registry2.  A “quasi-UML” model 
for this registry is shown in Figure 6.

Editor’s Comment: 
1. Should consider RegistryPackage for SymbolSet, and RuleSet. 
2. Should consider Classification Scheme for Standardized Color(s).  Note that the 

usual way to handle an associated image is to use a Browse Graphic.  This is a 
separate ExtrinsicObject that holds the image that would then be associated to the 
C-Node. 

3. Should consider Classification Scheme for Standardized Font(s). Note that the 
usual way to handle an associated image is to use a Browse Graphic.  This is a 
separate ExtrinsicObject that holds the image that would then be associated to the 
C-Node. 

4. Should consider RegistryPackage for ApplicationSchema, i.e. a collection of 
Feature types. 

One issue that arose in the thread discussions was whether or not there should be a 
separate registry for application schemas and how fine grained that registry should be.  
The scheme outlined above uses an association to relate the Rule and RuleSet to the 
application schema. 

Editor’s Comment: Since a Rule is a member of a RuleSet it would seem that an 
association from the Rule to the Association Schema alone would be sufficient. 

A number of other associations are part of the model as shown in Figure 7. 

 

 

Figure 7.  ebRIM Extension Package for Portrayal 

Editor’s Comment: 

An association (submittedBy) is used to support governance of the Portrayal Registry 
objects. It is suggested that this be done using life cycle metadata (e.g. Submitted, 
Approved, etc), in conjunction with the ebRIM audit trail.

4.7 Discussion 

Three different extension packages have been presented in this report.  A number of 
characteristics of these extension packages are of interest: 

1. Use of ExtrinsicObjects for the various portrayal registry concepts, with the 
detailed encoding captured in an associated Repository Item. (All)  This approach 
allows different encodings to be used for symbols and styles. 

2. Use of an “encoding” slot that says how the corresponding Repository item is 
encoded. (DGIWG model).  

3. Use of classification scheme for different types of symbols.  Used in both OWS-7 
and DGIWG.  This would seem to be the better approach also for OGC SLD/SE 
based model.   

4. Means of associating features and graphic objects.   

a. In the OWS-7 model this was handled by the abstract DataProduct 
Portrayal.   

b. In SE/SLD this was handled by the Rule object with an explicit 
association “style” referencing a Feature ExstrinsicObject, and an 
association “uses”, referencing one or more of the Symbolizer types. 

c. In DGIWG this was handled by both Rule and RuleSet objects with 
explicit associations to an ApplicationSchema ExtrinsicObject.  While this 
association makes sense for the case of a RuleSet, it might be better to 
have an association from the Rule to the Feature type that the rule is 
applied to. 

5. All three models provide a concept of grouping styling rules.  This is the Styled 
Layer Descriptor (SLD) in the SLD/SE model, the Rule Set in the DGIWG 
model, and the DataProductPortrayal with an SLD document as the Repository 
Item (RI) in the OWS-7 model.  

The term StyledLayerDescriptor has a somewhat mixed heritage.  It was 
originally proposed as a means of describing a visual (map) layer generated by a 
Feature Portrayal Service, and later became a means of describing so called 
named styles and layers as returned by any Web Map Service. SLD v1.1 
harmonized these two different approaches to the description of style in the 
context of map layers. 

This then raises the question as to the name that should be used in the 
PortrayalRegistry for a group of rules constituting a style.  One choice is of course 
SLD, but that seems overly bound to the particular encoding as specified in SLD 
1.1. An alternative, as proposed in the DGIWG model is that of rule set.  A third 
choice is that of DataProductPortrayal from OWS-7. Perhaps a fourth choice, 
combining elements of both, might be StyleRuleSet, or StyleRules, or simply 
Style. 

6. The DGIWG model uses the name SymbolSet for a collection of related Symbols 
(e.g. S-52 Symbols), OWS-7 used Symbol Library,  and the concept was not part 



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

21 

of the SLD/SE model.  The concept is clearly both useful and widely used.  
Likely Symbol Library is more commonly used term. 

A synthesis of the models discussed above is presented in Figure 4.7-1

4.8 What questions should the Portrayal Registry Address? 

One approach to creating the Portrayal Registry extension package is to specify the 
questions that such a registry should be able to answer, and then analyze these questions 
to develop the model. 

The following questions are believed to be representative of a broad set of portrayal 
requirements: 

1. Find and retrieve all symbols for the portrayal of features with point geometries. 

2. Find and retrieve all styling rules that can be applied to a particular feature type. 

3. Find and retrieve a style (set of styling rules) applicable to a particular schema 
(set of feature types). 

4. Retrieve a graphic that can be used to symbolize a feature with point geometry. 

5. Find and retrieve all rules that could be used with a feature with specific 
properties.  Note that this requires knowledge of the properties of the feature 
type.  Note also that the rule may only apply to a subset of the rules. 

6. Symbols may be parameterized.  Find all symbols with a specific set of 
parameters. Find the parameters of a selected symbol (e.g. Circle: Diameter, 
Colour). 

Note that we exclude questions that might be asked of a more general registry model such 
as 1) Find all WMS with maps for a given region or 2) Find all WFS that can provide 
certain feature types for a given area , 3) Find a Feature Portrayal Service that can 
process a specific rule set (style, SLD, StyleRuleSet). 

In utilizing a Feature Portrayal Service, we would want to locate a WFS, find the schema 
from the WFS (GetCapabilities, DescribeFeature), and then find a suitable style (see item 
3 above in Section 4.8) that can be applied to the WFS. Another use case would be to get 
an application schema from a WFS, or Registry (not necessarily focused on styles), and 
then retrieve a symbol library (see 4.8, items 1, 5, and 6) and construct a set of styling 
rules.  Register the styling rules (rule set) in a Portrayal Registry. 

Another user might then find this style and use a different FPS to style the features from 
the WFS and create a map. 

These use cases are summarized in Figure 8. 



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

23 

 

Figure 8.  Portrayal Registry Use Cases 

From these questions we can see that: 

1. We need a symbol library construct in the Registry. 

2. We need a Rule construct and we should be able to locate Rules based on the features 
and the symbols that they apply to.  Is symbol the best choice of word?  SE uses the 
“anthropomorphic” Symbolizer.  Is this better than symbol?  Neither seems entirely 
correct since in the case of photo-realistic styling, we would not think of the graphic 
output as a symbolic representation of the geography.  Would graphic object be 
better? 

Note that in some styling cases, the style rules effectively express symbol properties 
as functions of feature properties.  In this case, discovery via the Registry must enable 
us to find the rules which refer to features with specific properties.  Similarly, we 
would like to be able to find Symbols with specific properties.  Should this be a 
Registry task or something that must be handled by the style editor or map request 
client. 

4.9 Recommendations 

The following recommendations are based on the combined experience of developing 
ebRIM extension packages for Portrayal from OWS-7, OWS-8 Aviation and the OGC 
Special Activity Airspace (SAA) Pilot project. 

1. ExtrinsicObjects should be used to capture the key concepts that would be used in 
the Portrayal Process, but their specific encoding should be in the Repository 
Item, with a slot to specify the encoding.  This is done in the DGIWG portrayal 
registry. 



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 24 

2. Collections such as Symbol Set, Rule Set etc. should be modeled as Registry 
Packages, using a standard “HasMember” association. 

3. StandardColors, StandardFonts are a good idea.  We recommend that these be 
handled as Classification Schemes.  The Classification Nodes can have properties 
such as RGB value etc.  Additionally we could have a color image 
ExtrinsicObject classified by the StandardColors C-Scheme.  The same approach 
can be applied to StandardizedFonts.  We recommend these be named 
StandardColors and StandardFonts respectively. 

The recommended model is summarized in the following table:

This combines features of all of the models presented in Section 4. 

5 Feature Portrayal Service –Portrayal Registry Interaction 

5.1 Overview 

A Feature Portrayal Service is a form of Web Map Service (WMS) that obtains feature 
data (e.g. GML) from one or more Web Feature Services, and applies styling rules to 
create the map that is returned to a Map Request Client. This basic concept is illustrated 
in Figure 9. 

 

Figure 9.  Concept of a Feature Portrayal Service 

Note that in this diagram the actual styling rules are supplied by the requesting client and 
there is no Portrayal Registry (See 4.2.2). 

An important issue in connection with an FPS, is the applicability of the styling rules 
(SLD) with respect to the referenced WFS.  The styling rules are in effect defined relative 
to a GML application schema (call this a reference schema), and any WFS referenced in 
the requests from the FPS must be consistent (i.e. have the same feature type names and 
at least the same property names and types that are referenced in the styling rules) with 
the reference schema. 

5.2 Portrayal Registry 

A Portrayal Registry can enhance the picture of 9 by managing the styling rules (SLD) 
and symbols (SE), providing an association to the reference schema(s), and thus 
offloading these tasks from the client. This immediately facilitates the standardization of 
styles and symbols and hence their sharing across a specific application community.  This 
is illustrated in Figure 10. 



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 26 

 

Figure 10.  Concept of a Portrayal Registry 

While Figure 10 illustrates the general concept of a Portrayal Registry, there are other 
potential modes of interaction, depending on the capabilities of the FPS. These are 
discussed in the following sections.  For further details on the “standard” case of an FPS 
and Portrayal Registry see the OWS-7 Engineering Report entitled: OGC® OWS-7 
Engineering Report - Aviation Portrayal.   

Note that in Figure 10 the styling service is an OGC FPS that only “understands” styling 
documents expressed as OGC SLD documents with SE encodings for feature/coverage 
styles etc. In Section 4 however, we examined the case of a Portrayal Registry which 
supported other encodings than SLD/SE. In such a case it will be necessary to transform 
the Portrayal Registry response into an SLD/SE so that it can be consumed by the FPS.  
This use case was developed in some detail in the OWS-8 CCI Portrayal Registry TIE 
and is discussed in the following sections. 

We thus have the following roles for the Portrayal Registry: 
 

1. Manage information about available styling services (i.e. FPS) so that they can be 
discovered and used for portrayal. 

2. Manage information about available Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Map 
Services (WMS) so that they can be discovered and provide data (to be portrayed) 
or background maps that participate in the portrayal. While clearly this 
information is required for Portrayal, it should be considered for registration as 
more general information which is of importance for portrayal. 

3. Manage portrayal styling rules which are applicable to the styling of particular 
feature types. 

4. Manage symbols and symbol libraries in support of the styling rules in 3. 

5. Manage the GML application schemas that are “referenced” by the styling 
(portrayal) rules.  While clearly this information is required for Portrayal, it 
should be considered for registration as more general information which is of 
importance for portrayal.

5.3 Portrayal Registry Service (PRS) and Feature Portrayal Service (FPS) Interaction 

The sections below describe the three principal ways we see for a client to interact with 
the portrayal registry in conjunction with an FPS. 

5.3.1 Legacy (SLD 1.0) FPS 

The first use case describes a situation where a legacy FPS, i.e. an FPS not capable of 
communication with the PRS, is used by the client. This could for example be an FPS 
which only supports version 1.0 of the SLD standard, which does not contain the 
OnlineResource elements. 

The client (MapRequestClient) is then responsible for communication with the PRS, 
creating the SLD document and delivering it to the FPS (see Figure 11). 

 

Figure 11. Legacy FPS – Portrayal Registry Interaction 

 

Figure 12.  PRS Interaction with FPS via Processing Service 

 



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 28 

5.3.1.1 SLD/SE 1.1 FPS with OnlineResource Support 

The second use case describes a situation where the FPS is capable of interpreting 
OnlineResource references, removing the responsibility from the client to construct a 
'vanilla' SLD document.  

 

5.3.1.2 FPS with PortrayalRegistryStyle Support  

The third use case describes a situation where the FPS is capable of interpreting the 
proposed PortrayalRegistryStyle elements.  

 

DGIWG views the OWS-8 testbed as a way to evaluate the usefulness of a 
PortrayalRegistryStyle element. Compared to directly linking to an SE 1.1 document (via 
an OnlineResource reference), there are several potential benefits in this approach, 
including:  



Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

29 

� It allows the FPS to check in which formats the portrayal rules can be returned, 
and pick one that it supports. For example, an ESRI server talking to an ESRI 
portrayal registry could conceivably opt to retrieve the rules as some sort of 
"MXD fragments". 

� If there was a way to determine metadata like the application schema and feature 
class and from a WFS server, it could potentially allow the FPS to automatically 
only retrieve rules for that specific schema and class from the registry, thereby 
removing the need for the client to specify this information as part of the 
PortrayalRegistryStyle element.  

� If the FPS detects - based on the metadata it retrieves from the registry - that the 
portrayal rules correspond to a symbol standard it has support for (e.g. built-in 
rendering support for IHO S-52), it may elect to use its own styling engine, rather 
than the SE-encoded rules, to do the portrayal. Note that the author of the OWS-7 
Aviation Portrayal ER (Roger Brackin) identified the need for such a mechanism.

5.5.1 KML as a feature encoding 

Some participants in OWS-8 argued that KML can be considered as a feature encoding 
and one that is compliant with ISO 19109.  While there is no possibility to create a named 
type of object, (e.g. road) in KML, it is possible to attach attributes to a KML Placemark 
using ExtendedData, and some argue that this is sufficient to make a Placemark a feature, 
if only a kind of generic one. Note that the original intention of the KML ExtendedData 
element was to provide data values to parameterize the balloon style of the Placemark – 
for example the width of a placemark LineString can be drawn in proportion to a data 
value such as ‘numberOfLanes’ and the balloon style can reference such data using the 
following reference encoding: 

$[numberOfLanes]

However, despite the intention for balloon styling, the ExtendedData usage has no such 
schema-enforceable restriction in the OGC KML standard. 

Following this line of argument, KML “features” are then served by a WFS and styled by 
an FPS for presentation as KML. This would mean that Placemarks from the WFS are 
modified by the FPS by the addition of the KML <Style> elements. 

5.5.2 KML as a symbol encoding 

From a symbol encoding viewpoint, KML can be understood as a graphical language like 
SVG (W3C Scalable Vector Graphics), in particular in view of the proposed SVG Map 
specification. In this case, the KML Placemark can be seen as analogous to a Symbolizer 
in the OGC SE v1.1 specification. Features, expressed in another language (typically 
GML) are then styled by an FPS to KML according to the styling rules and applied 
filters. In this view, Style in KML is not a FeatureTypeStyle in the sense of OGC SE 
v1.1. In OGC KML 2.2, there are several types of styles (<Style> element children), 
namely <IconStyle>, <LabelStyle>, <ListStyle>, <LineStyle>, and <PolyStyle>, and 
each style element defines colour, thickness and other elements of the associated 
presentation element. KML Placemarks would be generated by the FPS, including the 
Style information. 

With respect to the Portrayal Registry, we would anticipate, for example, that a particular 
Symbol ExtrinsicObject (classified as a PolygonSymbol, and with encoding KML v2.2) 
would contain a KML <PolyStyle>.  The following table summarizes the anticipated 
KML content for the different Symbol types: 

 

Symbol!Type!

(PR)!(EO)!

ExtrinsicObject!Repository!

Item!

Comments!

Point! <IconStyle>! !

Line! <LineStyle>! !

Polygon! <PolyStyle>! !

Text! <LabelStyle>! !

 

Note that OGC KML 2.2 styling supports constructs which are not available in SE v1.1.  
In particular: 

1. The!ability!to!incorporate!attribute!values!via!<ExtendedData>.!
2. The!<ListStyle>!which!applies!to!the!appearance!of!items!in!a!“legend”.!!

The following table provides a rough comparison of SE v1.1 Symbolizers and the 
corresponding KML Style elements. 

KML3!Style!Element! SE!Symbolizer!Element! Comments!

                                                

3 Only KML 2.2 elements are used, i.e. no elements from extension namespaces are included.

5.6 Transforming Styles 

Since the Portrayal Registry can store more than one type of style encoding (via the 
encoding Slot), it will be, in many cases, necessary to transform a retrieved style to a 
different encoding, before it can be used by a styling service.  If the styling service is, for 
example, an OGC Feature Portrayal Service (FPS), it can only make use of style 
documents that are encoded as a Styled Layer Descriptor.   

This raises two questions, both of which were investigated to some degree in the TIE, 
namely: 

C Where!should!the!transformation!be!done.!
                                                

4 Means there is no comparable capability in KML 
5 SVG Parameters (like real SVG) provide many more controls such as opacity, dash array etc than possible in KML.

C How!general!can!such!transformation!be.!

5.6.1 Where should the transformation take place 

Two choices were proposed in the project, namely: 

1. Use!an!external!Web!Processing!service.!
2. Require!that!the!transformation!be!performed!by!the!Registry.!

5.6.1.1 Using a Web Processing Service 

A Web Processing Service is a general purpose web service that can perform any 
advertised operations on data supplied to the service.    In this case the input to the 
service would be styling information obtained from the Portrayal Registry, and the output 
would be an SLD that could be consumed by the FPS.   

The advantages of this approach are: 

1. The!WPS!is!easily!discovered!from!a!registry/catalogue!service.!
2. There!is!no!need!to!synch!static!copies!of!a!FeatureTypeStyle!which!have!simply!

The disadvantages of this approach are: 

1. Either!an!intervening!client!must!connect!the!PR!and!the!WPS,!or!there!be!some!form!of!

3. Performance!can!be!expected!to!be!degraded!since!several!web!service!interactions!are!
required!to!generate!the!presentation!output.!

5.6.1.2 Registry Utility 

Many Registry Services provide a transformation utility in support of the CSW-ebRIM 
“view” parameter.  While normally restricted to “full”, “brief” etc views of registry 
content, this could be extended to support the return of results in different forms. 

A particular transformation is then invoked depending on the value of the “view” 
parameter selected.  

The advantages of this approach are: 

1. A!request!mechanism!already!exists!which!can!be!used!by!a!registry!(user)!client!or!by!
an!FPS!(“give!me!the!results!in!this!form”)!to!get!the!style!in!the!desired!form.!

2. The!PR!has!the!complete!context!for!executing!the!required!transformation.!

The disadvantages of this approach are:

6.1 Symbol Libraries and Style Construction 

6.2 Overview 

One use case not considered in the TIE, is the creation of map styles using some form of 
map style editor.  This is illustrated in the following sequence diagram. 

 

Figure 6.1-1 Map Style Editor Creation 

As shown in the sequence diagram, the user responsible for a map style, loads a selected 
set of feature types (logical schema), and a symbol library (e.g. Point, Line and Polygon 
Symbols) and then proceeds to construct style mappings (e.g. SLD) using the Map Style 
Editor application.  The Editor then registers the style mapping (style) in the Portrayal 
Registry.

8 Interoperability Issues and Resolutions 

This section summarizes some of the issues and recommendations arising from the TIE.   

1. The ability to carry data (as in KML <ExtendedData> 6) should be added to SE 
Symbolizers so that feature property values can be used in symbols. 

2. Feature type names referenced in FeatureType Styles (SE or otherwise) must be 
provided as fully qualified names (i.e. with namespaces). 

3. An ebRIM model for Portrayal can be created which is abstract enough to enable 
multiple rule & symbol encodings, and which provides sufficient visible (in the 
registry)information to support 1) creation of styling documents (SLD) and 2) 
discovery of symbols, and styles appropriate to the presentation of particular 
feature types, and 3) management of symbol libraries. 

 

 

 

                                                

6 Some believe that this is sufficient to make KML feature-oriented.
