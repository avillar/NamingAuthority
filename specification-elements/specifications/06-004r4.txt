v. Changes to the OGC Abstract Specification 

The OGC Abstract Specification requires changes to accommodate the technical 
contents of this document. This document becomes a new volume in the Abstract 
Specification.  

No changes to existing abstract specification volumes are foreseen.  

vi. Future work 

Improvements in this document and to extensions of this document are desirable to: 

1. Establish rights expression language (REL) extensions for geospatial resource. 

2. Establish a resource identification and description metadata language to extend 
ISO 19115, and provide control information for GeoDRM-enabled systems. 

3. Establish a process identification and compliance language to provide control 
information for GeoDRM-enabled systems.  

4. Establish a variety of implementation models that balance Trust, Protection, and 
Remediation as required for different community-specific scenarios.

Foreword 

This document is a reference model for digital rights management (DRM) functionality 
for geospatial resources (GeoDRM). As such, it is connected to the general DRM 
market in that geospatial resources must be treated as nearly as possible like other 
digital resources, such as music, text, or services. It is not the intention here to reinvent 
a market that already exists and is thriving, but to make sure that a larger market has 
access to geospatial resources through a mechanism that it understands and that is 
similar to the ones already in use.  

This document does not replace any previous OGC specification, but it is dependent 
upon them. Each resource and service OGC specification that exists or will exist 
becomes a resource description in this document, and hopefully shall be subject to the 
same sorts of protection that is afforded to other digital resources.  

This document includes four annexes; Annexe A is normative, and Annexes B, C and D 
are informative. 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The OGC shall not be held responsible for identifying any 
or all such patent rights.

Introduction 

To create a marketplace, individuals who own something of value (here a resource) 
must have some level of assurance that they will be able to obtain fair value for its use 
or purchase. In a digital world, due to the nature of digital resources and commerce, 
most digital entities are not sold in the usual sense. When a user acquires an 
application, he actually acquires the right to use a copy of the application. Possession 
does not equate with ownership, and a system of software and resource licensing has 
grown up in the digital world that ensures the following types of things: 

− The user may legitimately act upon a resource if he has a corresponding licence for 
that act. 

− The owner should maintain the resource, fixing error (“bug-fix”) and assuring a 
guaranteed level of functionality.  

− Optionally, the user may be asked to pay the owner of the resource based upon 
agreed criteria, whether that is a one-time fee, a per-machine fee, a usage fee or 
some other mechanism stated in the legal contract or licence between user and 
owner. 

− The user agrees to protect the owner’s rights based on the agreement. This usually 
means he cannot backward engineer code or resource, nor redistribute the resource 
without proper permission. 

− The owner agrees to maintain the resource and allow a reasonable access to the 
users for any fixes that may be required. Again, the extent or degree of maintenance 
is stated in the user agreement. 

− To create and support a large-scale, open market in geospatial resources, this type 
of protection is needed to assure that a “fair value for work (investment)” ethic can 
be guaranteed so that suppliers can be sure of fair return on individual sales, and 
users can be sure of fair value for purchases of uses of resources.  

This document describes how this is to be done.

Motivation 

For the licensing of digital content, different standards already exist. However, the 
existing standards (e.g. MPEG-REL or ISO-REL, ISO 21000) describe the licensing of 
digital media content and cannot be used for licensing of geographic information unless 
they are extended. Therefore, this DRM Rights Model for geographic information is 
necessary and its relevance can be explained by examining its various aspects.  

First, the Rights Model for digital geographic content must accommodate licensing for 
different types of business relationships and participants with different roles, as it is 
described in chapter 8.1, Overview: Roles and Responsibilities. Here, direct licensing 
as well as sub-licensing can take place for business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-
consumer (B2C) relationships. In particular for sub-licensing, it must be possible to 
grant licences for issuing licences, which is not covered by existing ISO-REL Rights 
Models. 

Second, licensing in the GeoDRM domain must support the licensing of digital content, 
based on different infrastructures: licensing can take place for a static product as it can 
be delivered on CD-ROM. However, even more important is the aspect that licensing 
can also take place on geographic information as it can be dynamically "created" by 
using OpenGIS Web Services. Here, the digital geographic content (called resource in 
this specification) that is to be licensed is the result of a service invocation using 
particular parameters. For example, maps can be created by using a Web Map Service 
and feature collections can be created by executing a Web Feature Service. The 
GeoDRM Rights Model therefore supports the capability to describe rights for 
executing a service using certain constraints on parameters (parameter values must be 
in a certain range). This capability, as described in 9.5.3.3.9, Parameter Range 
conditions, is also not covered by other Rights Models such as in the ISO-21000 [11] or 
ODRL [17] and OMA DRM [18]. 

Third, licensing of geographic information requires support to declare and enforce 
rights, as they are based on the geometry of the digital content. This capability is 
described in this standard by defining geo-specific conditions on a right, as defined in 
section 9.5.3.3.6, Spatial Temporal Conditions.

Geospatial Digital Rights Management Reference Model  
(GeoDRM RM) 

Modèle de la référence pour la gestion des droits pour l'usage dans l'information 
géographique 

1 Scope 

This standard defines: 

• A conceptual model for digital rights management of geospatial resources, providing 
a framework and reference for more detailed specification in this area. 

• A metadata model for the expression of rights that associate users to the acts that they 
can perform against a particular geospatial resource, and associated information used 
in the enforcement and granting of those rights, such as owner metadata, available 
rights and issuer of those rights. 

• Requirements that are placed on rights management systems for the enforcement of 
those rights. A rights management system must be necessary and sufficient: it must 
implement only those restrictions necessary to enforce the rights defined therein, and 
it must be sufficient to enforce those rights.  

• How this is to work conceptually in the larger DRM context to assure the ubiquity of 
geospatial resources in the general services market.  

A resource in this context is a data file, or service for geographic information or process. 

This abstract specification builds on and complements the existing OGC specifications, 
and defines at an abstract level a Rights Model to enable the digital rights management of 
standards-based geospatial resources. Future GeoDRM Implementation Specifications 
will be written to implement the concepts defined in this document.

Figure 1: GeoDRM Reference Model Context 

Figure 1 shows a simplified view of how this document, the Geospatial Digital Rights 
Management Reference Model (indicated in grey) relates to the ISO Open Distributed 
Processing standard, OGC Reference Model and OWS Common initiative. The purpose 
of this document is to define the conceptual framework and rights model for the future 
GeoDRM Implementation Standards, which will enable the digital rights management of 
geospatial resources. 

This specification is not intended to delve into questions of morals, ethics, market model, 
or implementations any further than is necessary to express requirements against rights 
management functionalities and systems.  

2 Conformance 

Conformance with this specification shall be checked using tests specified in Annex A 
(normative). Conformance classes for this standard are: 

• Alignment of rights expression to the abstract rights model,  

• The expression for applicability of rights for geospatial resources, and  

• The enforcement of rights for geospatial resources. 

Resources that are augmented by GeoDRM licence metadata will be referred to as 
GeoDRM extended resources. Processing resources that have met the requirements to 
maintain GeoDRM resource and enforce the licensing procedures shall be referred to as 
GeoDRM enabled.

this GeoDRM standard in order to assure interoperability of geospatial resource DRM with that used for other 
multimedia information.

4.1  
access control 

combination of authentication and authorisation 

4.2  
agency   

legal relationship of a person (called the agent) who acts on behalf of another person, 
company or government (called the principal) 

4.3  
agent 

one who acts on behalf of another 

4.4  
annotate 

adding notations or commentaries to a resource (or parts of it) creating a new 
resource 

4.5  
authentication  

verification that a potential partner in a conversation is capable of representing a 
person or organization 

[W3C; http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-ws-gloss-20040211/#defs] 

4.6  
authorisation 

determination whether a subject is allowed to have the specified types of access to a 
particular resource 

Note: Usually, authorisation is in the context of authentication. Once a subject is authenticated, it 
may be authorized to perform different types of access.  

[ Security Taxonomy and Glossary; HYPERLINK "http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/secure.htm" 
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/secure.htm] 

4.7  
bypass 

mechanism to defeat the purpose of a subsystem by avoiding its invocation  

Note: Security systems are bypassed usually by using security faults in the operating system. Such 
infringements are more an aspect of the operating system than of the security system. To 
correct this, the relationship between the security system and the operating system must be 
modified to prevent bypass mechanisms.  

4.8  
chain of agency 

sequence of agency where the agent in each relationship is the principal of the next 
in the chain 

Note: A chain of agency, with the proper agreements at each step creates a transitive agency between 
the agent of the first link and the principal of the last. This chain can be spoken of in either 
direction, either as “principal → agent = principal → agent” (normal or granting order) or 
“agent → principal = agent → principal” (reverse, acceptance, verification or tracing order).

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 131 

4.9   
chain of licence 

sequence of licences that traces a chain of agency, where a licence is granted at each 
link of the chain, allowing the agent at that link to act as the principal in the next 

Note: As with the chain of agency, this chain can be spoken of in either direction.  

4.10  
contract 

agreement between two or more principals that creates in each principal a duty to do 
or not do something and a right to performance of the other's duty or a remedy for the 
breach of the other's duty 

(after http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/) 

4.11  
copyleft (GPL) 
 

licence that accompanies some open source software that details how the software 
and its accompanying source code can be freely copied, distributed and modified 

Note:  The most widespread use of GPL (General Public Licence) is in reference to the GNU GPL, 
which is commonly abbreviated simply as GPL when it is understood that the term refers to the 
GNU GPL. One of the basic tenets of the GPL is that anyone who acquires the material must 
make it available to anyone else under the same licensing agreement. The GPL does not cover 
activities other than the copying, distributing and modifying of the source code. A GPL is also 
referred to as a copyleft, in contrast to a copyright, which identifies the proprietary rights of 
material. (DRMWatch.com) 

4.12  
digital licence 

document or its representation that specifies the rights granted to a particular user or 
organization with respect to a specific content or group of content 

Note: The core concept in DRM is the use of digital licences. Instead of buying the digital content, 
the consumer purchases a licence granting certain rights with respect to the content. A licence 
is the mechanism by which a rights holder conveys rights to another party, such as a consumer 
or distributor. 

4.13  
Digital Rights Management (DRM)  

packaging, distributing, controlling and tracking content based on rights and 
licensing information 

Note:  DRM covers a much broader spectrum of capabilities and underlying technologies supporting 
description, identification, trading, protecting monitoring and tracking of all forms of rights 
usages for both tangible and intangible (electronic) assets, including the management of rights-
holders relationships. See for example Iannella [21] 

 “Digital” refers to the material over which the rights exist. “Rights” applies to the intellectual 
property rights linked to the material. “Management” covers both defining a policy and 
enforcing that policy in such a way that rights are respected. 

 The ultimate goal of a distributed DRM system is for content authors to be able to project 
policies governing their content into remote environments with confidence that those policies 
will be respected by the remote nodes – LaMacchia (2002).

 For the purposes of this document, DRM is taken to mean technology that enable the secure 
distribution (and where appropriate, sale) of digital media content on the Internet. (JISC, 
Shared Service and Middleware Studies, Scoping Study into DRM ITT)  

4.14  
expected risk 

expected value (statistics) of loss 

Note: Expected risk is calculated by multiplying the probability of the types of infringement by the 
cost of that infringement, summed up over all types of infringement.  

4.15  
fair use 

uses of content that are considered valid defences to copyright infringement, such as 
for criticism or educational purposes 

[U.S. legal term] 

Note:  Fair use is based on case-law precedents derived from general principles. The term is often 
misapplied to refer to the reasonable expectations of consumers to be able to use purchased 
content on all owned devices. (DRMWatch.com) 

4.16  
general public licence 

licence containing rights accorded to the general public without an existing 
agreement 

Note: GPLs can be granted by the owner of a resource or may be applied to a resource by law, 
usually as part of the copyright law. The most obvious GPL concept is “fair use” in the United 
States for copyrighted material. Other GPL rights may be demanded by the source of the 
resource or other “public good” considerations.  

4.17  
GeoDRM enabled (applied to processing resources) 

capable of maintaining GeoDRM extended resources and enforcing GeoDRM 
defined rights and protections 

4.18  
GeoDRM extended (applied to resources) 

associated to GeoDRM metadata indicating types of licences that apply  

4.19  
geoLicence 

licence related to geo-information 

4.20  
geoLicence resolution 

settling or resolving the status of a geoLicence 

4.21  
geoLicence infringement 

act or an instance of the unauthorized access or use of protected, copyrighted or 
patented material or of a trademark, trade name, or trade dress 

(after http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/) 

http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 131 

4.22  
infringement (of a licence) 

act of a principal contrary to rights granted to that principal on a resource 

Note: Infringement of a licence should require the DRM system to be bypassed in some manner. If 
licences can be infringed without bypassing the DRM system, then the system is not sufficient. 

4.23  
infringement (of a right) 

prevention of an act of a principal consistent with rights granted to that principal on a 
resource 

Note: Infringement of a right is a fault in the DRM system. If rights can be infringed without 
bypassing the DRM system, then the system is not properly restricted to that which is 
necessary. 

4.24  
joint ownership 

ownership by two or more persons each having undivided shares in the property as a 
whole 

(http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/)  

Note: In this case the principal as owner is a principal group, i.e. a group of other principals.  

4.25  
lease 

allowing the resource to be made available for a fixed period of time then returned 

Note: During this period, the resource is only available to the lessee. Temporal constraints are 
required for downstream use. 

4.26  
lend 

lease without exchange of value 

4.27  
licence 

representation of grants that convey to principals the rights to use specified resources 
subject to specified conditions 

(derived from XrML 2.0 specification, part 5)  

Note: A licence represents, but is not, a contract that grants a party explicit rights to use intellectual 
property.  

4.28  
licence extents 

scope or applicability of a licence 

Note:  The extent can be described in spatial, temporal or any other parameter range appropriate to the 
rights described in the licence.

4.29  
licence manager 

application that tracks licences available within an organization and coordinates the 
issuing of these licences to requesting clients 

(after http://www.basis.com/advantage/mag-v3n2/flexconcepts.html) 

4.30  
licensee 

one to whom a licence is given 

(http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/). 

4.31  
licensing agent 

principal authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing 
with third parties in the context of issuing licences for specified resources 

(after http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/ for ‘agent’) 

4.32  
licensor 

issuer of a licence 

(after http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/)  

Note: May be a content owner or a licensing agent.  

4.33  
lineage 

chain of legal ownership of content; history of ownership 

4.34  
map  

visual representation of geoinformation; a map is not the resource itself 

Note: A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of georeferenced resource. Therefore a WMS can 
provide many different representations of the same underlying geoinformation.  

4.35  
necessary 

capable of recognizing and properly acting upon all legitimate requests, as defined by 
the requirements of the system 

Note: All aspects of a DRM system are necessary if they do not prevent legitimate requests from 
execution.  

4.36   
owner  

one with an interest in and dominion over content: as 

a) "legal owner" in this entry 
b) one with the right to exclusive use, control, or possession of content 
c) a purchaser under a contract for the sale of real content

(after http://dictionary.lp.findlaw.com/ ) 

4.37  
party 
principle 

a person or organisation that plays a role in a rights transaction 

Note  These two terms are used as near synonym from ORDL and ISO 21000. There shall be no 
distinction between these two terms made here, but there may be distinctions in legal 
documents depending on local laws.  

 For example, in some legal traditions, “party” refers to person in a legal dispute, while 
“principal” may be the entity initiating a contract, such as an agency.  

4.38   
payment provider 

party that has an established billing relation with a consumer 

(http://www.newgenpay.com/faq.html) 

Note: Payment providers may be telephone and cellular companies, banks, credit card corporations, 
ISPs, network operators and utility companies. The payment provider bills the consumer, 
deducts a fee, and forwards the payment to the content provider. The payment provider is thus 
responsible for the balancing of accounts.  

4.39  
persistent protection mechanisms 

protection mechanism that remains in force regardless of where the content of the 
original resource is located or reproduced 

Note: Persistent protection mechanisms involve authentication, authorization and encryption 
technologies for effectively locking digital contents and limiting distribution to those who pay.  

4.40  
protection 

aspect of the system that lowers the capability of party to commit infringement 

4.41  
provenance 

information on the place and time of origin or derivation or a resource or a record or 
proof of authenticity or of past ownership 

4.42  
resource 

entity that is protected by a licence 

Note: In general, a resource is data, metadata (a type of data describing other resources) or some 
service or process that can be invoked on other resources. Licences describe rights on resources 
and, as such, are resources in themselves.

4.43   
remediation 

act or process of correcting a fault or deficiency 

Note: Remediation allows more trust because it lowers expected risk. The first act in a remediation 
sequence is detection of the fault.  

4.44  
right 

permission to act that makes a party entitled to act with respect to all or part of a 
specified resource under the terms of the license 

(after ISO 21000 - 5) 

Note: A right specifies an action (or activity) or a class of actions that a principal may perform on or 
using the associated resource. A right is for all intents and purposes a legally recognized 
entitlement to do something to or with the content of a resource. (DRMWatch.com). 

4.45  
rights holder 

principal that owns the right to license rights to a resource

Note: Rights may be by law (copyright), by agreement or by contract (the “licence” agreement). In 
the case of digital commerce, DRM ensures that licences are adhered to, and that rights holders 
are compensated as appropriate for each transaction. Agents of the original rights holder may 
also issue licences, but their ability is only under the agency contract to the original principal.

Normally, trust requires something, but if the principal at risk decides that no risk exists, then 
trust exists (in the sense here) since risk has been reduced, whatever the reason.

6 GeoDRM Design Principles 

6.1 GeoDRM Roadmap 

In order to support GeoDRM-enabled licensing of geographic information, as it can be 
available offline or online in a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), different functionalities 
can be identified as necessary. Bundling a certain set of functionalities into a function 
package allows defining (i) interfaces between the packages to ensure interoperability 
and (ii) responsibilities for each package to return the expected result upon a given 
request. The following is a list of possible packages: 

• Rights Model: The definition of an abstract Rights Model is the topic of this 
specification. It defines the basis for developing a geo-specific Rights Expression 
Language as well as other specifications necessary to establish a GeoDRM- 
enabled SDI.  

• Rights Expression Language: This package provides the capabilities to express 
usage rights in the form of a machine-readable and machine-processible 
representation. The definition of a geo-specific Rights Expression Language is not 
part of this document, but is to be defined upon the Rights Model declared in this 
specification. 

• Encryption: This package includes required functionality to protect a GeoDRM- 
enabled SDI against fraud. First, encryption enables the protection of a licence so 
that it cannot be modified by an adversary in order to obtain additional rights. 
Second, encryption is also useful to protect the digital geographic content against 
unlicensed use. An example from the music industry exists, where the encrypted 
music file can only be decrypted (and played) by a certified software or hardware 
device. Because security and trust are not geo-specific, no standardization is 
planned from this WG. 

• Trust: Every type of business relationship that has been represented in an 
electronic way needs a mechanism to differentiate between reliable and unreliable 
partners. In that sense, trust tells a relying partner that the other behaves in a 
certain predictable (loyal) way. One mechanism to establish trust between entities 
in an SOA [spell out] can be done by adding authenticity information on the 
digital content that is been exchanged between the partners. This mechanism, 
typically called a Digital Signature, is not geo-specific and therefore is not a 
relevant topic for standardization by this WG. 

• Licence Verification: This package defines the functionality that is required to 
validate a licence. The licence verification has to occur before the rights of the 
licence can be enforced. Because document authentication is not geo-specific, it is 
not a topic for standardization by this WG. 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 29 of 131 

• Enforcement and Authorization: The rights expressed in a GeoLicence need to 
be enforced. In this specification, this package functionality is represented by the 
"Gate Keeper" metaphor (see Figure 2). The acceptance or denial decision for a 
particular request (with its associated licences) is based on the authorization 
decision, as it is derived by the authorization engine. Because enforcement and 
authorization is geo-specific, the appropriate standardization is upcoming work to 
be based on this specification. 

• Authentication: The basic requirement for trust, licence verification and 
enforcement/authorization is proof of identity, as it is provided by the 
functionality of this package. Different international standards, which define how 
to enable this functionality, exist. Because authentication is not geo-specific, it is 
not a topic for standardization by this WG. 

6.2 Basics 

DRM is first a metadata-tracking problem. Both resources and principals are associated to 
descriptions (metadata) and those descriptions must be tracked and matched for the 
controlled actions to proceed. The resource metadata is the resource identity and 
description, and the principal metadata is the set of licences he has or has access to.  

Second, DRM is an enforcement problem. Once identity and licences have been checked, 
the results enter into the stage where the principal wishes to take action with respect to 
that resource. The DRM system controls the scope of those actions to a degree 
determined by design of the system. This “degree of control” is a measure of trust. The 
more the principals can be trusted, the less control is needed. In a zero or negative trust 
(distrust) environment the control may be great and will be critical for protection against 
malicious or licence-inconsistent acts of users.  

6.3 Flow model of GeoDRM 

In describing acts on resources, we will consider directed graphs where each arrow in the 
graph is a triple consisting of: 

• a set of 1 or more input resources, (the start point of the arrow), 

• an act (the arrow), and  

• a set of 0 or more of output resources (the end point of the arrow). 

For example, the act of applying a WMS.GetMap to a Feature Collections to derive a 
(raster) Map would be represented as: 

 .WMS GetMapFeatureCollection ImageMap⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯→  

If the act is to apply a licensable process resource to a licensable data resource, then the 
input resources are the process resource and data resource, the act is to execute the 
process against the data, and the output is the results of the act. If the result is not 
licensable, then the last part of the triple may be NULL or empty. For the example above, 
the user would have to have an execute right for the feature collection resource where the 
process satisfied the WMS specification, an execute right for the resource that executed 
the WMS.GetMap process, and a derived right to view (display, print) the image map 
produced.

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 30 of 131 

This is a logical function that allows the descriptions here to be consistent, and helps the 
semantics of licences, which cannot be analysed against a data and process flow diagram 
represented by a directed graph as described above. 
6.4 GeoDRM Gatekeeper Metaphor 

The GeoDRM processing at its minimum is a mechanism to test if an action (an 
orchestrated set of processing arrows in the graph representation described above) is 
permissible given: 

• the party requesting the action, 

• the resources (data and processing being used), 

• the licences belonging to the party in a), including descriptions of rights, 
resources and conditions,3 

• the owner of the resources, and a mechanism to trace his agency chains from the 
resources in b), and 

• the local context of the resources, including local general rights (held by all), 
applicable laws/policies and the local security system ratings.  

The GeoDRM system acts as a gatekeeper, making the decision to allow or disallow 
request for processing based on the information verified and passed to it by the local 
secure process controller. Figure 2 shows a simple local topology for such a system. In 
general, the components are location independent as long as secure communication can 
be assured between the three basic components: 

1) A security system capable of validating the documents and resource data supplied 
to in external request for processing.  

2) A GeoDRM logic module (here called Gatekeeper) that would decide on the 
consistency of: 

• the request,  

• the licences available to the principal making the request, and  

• the processes available to the system, either directly or through other 
gateway/gatekeeper pairs.  

3) A processing node supplies a secured environment where licensed resources can 
be used without leakage.  

The only data in or out of the system is under the control of the security system and the 
consent of the gatekeeper GeoDRM.  

In the simplest case, where a single request does not cascade, then the communication 
topology of Figure 2 is sufficient. The sequence is as follows: 

                                                 

3 In a license, several rights may be assigned to parties on different resources. Each subunit of the licence (called a 
"grant" in this model) will consist of either explicit or implicit descriptions of the party concerned, the rights (acts) to 
be done by this party, one or more resource that is involved in the act, and any conditions or constraints on this grant.

1. A request containing the functional information concerning the request and 
whatever licence information the user believes is needed arrives from a user. This 
information may be by reference, and may only be the user’s verifiable identity so 
that the security system can fetch validated copies of his licences from a local 
store.  

2. The Security component of the systems verifies identities and the various 
signatures associated to the documents, which gives all documents a traceable 
provenance. This information is passed to the GeoDRM Gatekeeper, who has 
access to all pertinent context information on the resources being invoked. 

3. The Gatekeeper verifies that the licences give the users the rights to the resources 
(both data and processing) that would allow him to execute his request. If the 
licence does not cover the request or an important document was found to be 
invalid, the security system returns an error message to the user on causes of the 
error.

4. If the licence does cover the request, then the security system passes the request to 
the geoserver for processing.  

5. When the geoserver is done, the results are passed back to Security. Any new 
resource will be marked with metadata as to use and sublicensing restrictions. 

6. The Security system passes the results to the user.  

In a more complex scenario, where more that one geoserver is used, transport topologies 
like the one in Figure 3 may come into play.

In this example a user makes a navigation request to one server, who cascades a feature

the relationship between the two geoservers will likely be optimised, and simpler more 
direct sequences will be used. For the purposes of this example, we will assume here that 
no such prearrangement has been put in place. The sequence of request and responses is 
given in the sequence diagram in Figure 4

Figure 4: Sequence diagram for a two-stage geoserver interaction 

The sequence of response pairs is very similar to that in the previous example.  
1. A request containing the functional information concerning the request and 

whatever licence information the user believes is needed arrives from a user.  

2. The Security component of the systems verifies identities and the various 
signatures associated to the documents, which gives all documents a traceable 
provenance. This information is passed to the local GeoDRM Gatekeeper, who 
has access to all pertinent context information on the resources being invoked.

3. The Gatekeeper verifies that the licences give the user the rights to the resources 
(both data and processing) that would allow him to execute his request. If the 
licence does not cover the request or an important document was found to be 
invalid, the Security system returns an error message to the user on causes of the 
error. If the licence does cover the request, then a “request is valid” message is 
sent to the Security system. 

4. The Security system passes the request to the local navigation geoserver for 
processing.  

5. The navigation geoserver finds a point in the process where data from an external 
roads database is needed. It formats a request giving its local identity as sender, 
and including a “temporary transactional” licence showing that it is acting as a 
computing agent for the original requestor, and that it has been certified to handle 
licensed data locally. 

6. This request is passed through Security to the Security of the feature server.  

7. The feature server Security passes the transaction licence data to its local 
Gatekeeper. 

8. The local Gatekeeper validates the transaction, and returns the decision to the 
requesting Security gateway.  

9. Security passes the request to the local geoserver.  

10. The local geoserver performs the task and send the results back to Security 

11. The feature service Security passes the results to the Navigation server Security. 

12. Navigation Security passes the data to the Navigation server 

13. When the Navigation server is done, the results (a set of navigation instructions) 
are passed back to Security. Any new resource will be marked with metadata as to 
use and sublicensing restrictions. 

14. Security sends the final results to the user.  

Notice that the sequence diagram, which ignores transport details, does not differ 
between the two user types in Figure 3. Several variations on the transport topology 
would yield the same sequence diagram. Most of the GeoDRM processing is location 
transparent.

Figure 6: Structure of a Licence 

From this we see that the needed information for DRM to work includes: 
1. A mechanism for identifying principals, for both the identification of the 

licensee and licensor of each licence,

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 35 of 131 

2. A mechanism for identifying resources so that licences and resources can be 
matched to validate the licence, 

3. A set of rights that may be granted in a geoLicence, 

4. An association of each of those rights to particular “software-based” actions, 

5. A definition of the types and meanings of conditions that may apply to each 
right, principal or resource and  

6. A signature mechanism for authentication of identity and to verify that the 
licence has not been modified in any significant manner.  

The parts of the licence have the following conceptual meanings:

6.6 Developmental Guidelines 

In developing this specification several design guidelines have been followed. These 
include, but are not limited to, the following “best practices”: 

• The GeoDRM Model must support ubiquitous geographic information. 

• Keep the DRM policy really simple, but no simpler. 

• Keep DRM as coarse-grained as possible while maintaining basic requirements. 

• Apply as little DRM as possible, but no less. 

• Delegate licence creation maintenance, enforcement and security. 

• Licence management should be transparent to the end-user; licence flows should 
be identical to unlicensed ones where feasible.  

• Adapt to fit common business, trading, pricing and licensing models. 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 36 of 131 

• Accept manageable risks then manage them. 

The ultimate goal of geographic standards is to make geographic information and 
services available and readily usable to the entire information services community. 
Therefore the use of geographic information and other information should be minimally 
different. 

6.7 The components of managing risk 

Managing risk is about balancing trust with protection and remediation. The optimal 
balance among these components depends on the specific business context. For example, 
where high levels of trust exist, lower levels of protection and remediation may be 
acceptable. 

Remediation
(Enforcement)

Protection 
(Security)

Trust

 

Figure 7: Balancing trust with protection and remediation 

The following sections examine these components in more detail. 

6.7.1 Trust 

Digital rights management is about trust. Internet commerce cannot occur without some 
level of mutual trust, even more so when the parties are not in personal contact and 
resources are ethereal like digital data. These criteria often make business models based 
on classical business practices inappropriate – see [19]. 

The contract that exists between buyer and seller is a description of that trust, and the 
DRM system aids both parties by aiding in the enforcement of the contract through the 
software that accesses and processes the resource. 

Since the DRM system should enforce that which is not in the contract and only the 
contract, it aids in maintaining a position of fair enforcement that enhances the 
relationship and prevents misunderstanding while preserving the rights of both parties. 

The business environment for a DRM system can vary widely. In one extreme, everyone 
is trusted and the DRM is simply an aid for tracking process and data flows for the 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 37 of 131 

purposes of the system (possibly including remediation if the trust is broken). In the other 
extreme, no one is truly trusted and the DRM controls all resource flows that involve 
licences. In this case, the licensed resources are “locked” from general use and all 
software handling licensed transactions is “trusted” in the sense that it is integrated 
sufficiently with the DRM system to prevent the gatekeeper from being bypassed, and a 
licensed resource “leaking” into a freely available world.  

The most likely scenario is a trust model that is “gated,” capable of controlling the level 
of freedom in each transaction based on the rights and conditions stated in the various 
licences involved. While complex, such a system allows maximum flexibility based on 
the DRM business model in use. Most of the examples in this document are from this 
middle ground, where the control over how a resource is to be handled is embodied in the 
licences that are issued against it and not in the system design. This makes the licence 
content independent of implementation.  

6.7.2 Protection - security  

A DRM system enhances the altruistic trust by providing before the fact (ex ante facto) 
protections. The user, through trusted software, knows that he can legally do that which 
he is allowed to do and the owner of the resource knows that abuse of the contract is at 
least difficult. The degree of difficulty should be proportional to the risk to the resource, 
where valuable resources are generally protected more than ones of lesser value.  

Examples of protection can be anything that restricts access to resources to those able to 
present and prove licensed rights to those resources. An authorization "log-in" system 
could be used in those cases where the structured contact between system and user gives 
some guarantee of identity. Other systems may depend on the proving of identity and 
reference to a valid licence with each interaction of user and resource.  

Protection systems (i.e. security systems) are a realm unto themselves, and DRM systems 
will be heavily dependent on the choice of security implementation – see [2] and [3]. The 
most likely candidates for web-based DRM security involve the ability to distribute 
keyed files that are unreadable without the key, and then to control the key distribution 
(cryptography).  

6.7.3 Remediation - enforcement 

Remediation is an act or process of correcting a fault or deficiency. Since no protection 
system is perfect, there is an additional need to track licensable acts. This tracking allows 
the software to act as the first step in any remediation steps taken after the fact (ex post 
facto). The actual remedial actions may be stated in the contract, or in the written or 
common law.  

For example, if a buyer wishes to minimize the cost of his licence by restricting it to 
those things he actually uses, he can agree to be subject to a flexible licensing agreement 
that grows the licence on an “as-needed” basis. In this case, the remedial event of the first 
use of a licensable act would be the granting (and billing) of a new licence update to 
cover that act.

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 38 of 131 

6.7.4 Metadata in support of trust 

Support of trust through protection and remediation is predicated on the unambiguous 
identification of users, resources, rights and processes. The mechanism for this is the 
association of metadata to each that enables the tracking of resources, users, licences, 
rights and the actions that they reference.  

User metadata consists of user identification and various licences and access rights that 
describe their geo-processing environment.  

Resource metadata consists of resource identification and authority control information 
that describes what rights and licences are associated to this resource. 

Licence metadata consists of the identification of the various resources, licensees, 
licensors, rights and restrictions that will act as software control mechanism under the 
DRM system.  

Rights metadata consists of the definition of the act that right allows. Such metadata can 
be references to standard IT processing mechanisms or other specific geo-processing 
standards, such as those from ISO TC 211 or the OGC. It can also be implementation 
specific, identifying what software or software resource that may be used in the action 
allowed by the right.  

Process metadata consists of the identification of the underlying software and the 
various standards and rights' acts that can be executed with this software. Since the use of 
software is essential in the execution of the rights-specified acts, the identification and 
certification of processes may be the purview of the standards-creating organization 
responsible for its standardization.  

The procedures involved in a DRM system at its core is the control of actions taken on 
resources under the control of the DRM system as determined by the comparison of the 
various types of metadata described above.  

For example, if a user requests a process on a resource, the DRM system would be 
responsible for identification of the user, the assessment of the rights associated to the 
user, and the comparison of those rights with the process and resource requested. If 
everything matches, then the action of executing the process on the resource is allowed.  

7 GeoDRM Enterprise Viewpoint and Abstract Rights Model 

In this section, we will define those key concepts needed for geospatial rights definition. 
The purpose of the GeoDRM Abstract Rights Model is to define the base conceptual 
model, which may then be used for the definition of GeoDRM Implementation 
Specifications. 

Managing Intellectual Property is essentially an abstract problem. In the physical world 
we can see the boundaries between physical properties, and we intuitively understand the 
rights to access that property based on social, legal and political conventions. Before you 
enter your friend’s home you need his permission. When you travel to a foreign country 
you need to present your passport before you are allowed access to that territory. 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 39 of 131 

However, managing Intellectual Property presents us with the key challenge that the 
“territory” we want to manage only exists in the abstract and not the physical world. 
Before we can manage and protect this Intellectual Property “landscape” effectively, we 
need to define a shared concept of what is being managed, which is universally 
understood by all involved. 

The key purpose of the GeoDRM Abstract Rights Model is to create a simplified model 
of geospatial Intellectual Property so that it may be practically licensed, and most 
importantly, rights to that Intellectual Property may be managed and protected. It is about 
establishing shared notions, conventions and practices that express the boundaries within 
the Intellectual Property “landscape”. With defined Intellectual Property boundaries, we 
are then able to share exchange and trade rights to geospatial resources in a clearly 
defined and managed way. 

7.1 Geospatial Resource 

A geospatial resource is a well-defined set of geographic resources or functionality that 
can be either a resource set, a subset of a resource as specified by a filter encoding, etc.  

Note:  We are trying to create a rights management mechanism that is independent of the geospatial 
resource being managed.  

7.2 GeoLicence Extents 

A GeoLicence is the mechanism to manage and protect a geospatial resource. 

A GeoLicence is the expression of the rights and constraints on those rights to be 
performed against a geospatial resource.  

GeoLicence rights and constraints may be expressed using, but not limited to, the 
following dimensions: 

• Right: A privilege that is granted by the Owner. For example, the right to View, 
Print, Copy, and Update, etc. a geospatial resource. 

• Space: A geospatial area. For example, a specific country such as the United 
Kingdom. 

• Time: A period of time. For example, the year 2005. 

A GeoLicence is the container expressing the rights to use a specified geospatial 
resource, for a given geographical space, over a specific period of time – subject to other 
conditions.  

Figure 8 shows these three dimensions with the extents of the GeoLicence drawn as the 
dotted block.

Figure 8: GeoLicence Extents 

An example GeoLicence may express the rights to View, Print, Copy and Update, all 
United Kingdom road resource for 2005. 

NOTE:  

1.  Potentially, we have more than one time dimension, resource time or licence time. For example, 
time may relate to the time when specific features were last updated (resource time), or the 
period of time to which the licence applies (licence time).  

 For simplicity, the time dimension of a GeoLicence shall mean the period for which the licence 
applies (licence time). 

2.  Potentially, the spatial dimension could mean either the geospatial extents of the GeoLicence, 
or the legal jurisdiction where the licence applies, or even the location of the licensee.  

 For simplicity, the space dimension of a GeoLicence shall mean the geospatial extents of the 
GeoLicence, namely that geospatial area of a given resource to which the licensee is granted 
rights. 

7.3 GeoLicence Expression 

GeoLicences may be expressed in different forms – which all essentially mean the same 
thing, but are different forms according to the intended audience. Potentially, we can 
envisage three corresponding expressions of GeoLicence: 

• Legal Expression: A legally binding expression of the terms and conditions of the 
licence, which may then be legally enforced. 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 41 of 131 

• Simplified Expression: A simplified, more “human” readable version of the 
licence, expressing key terms and conditions, which may be easily read and 
understood by a more general audience. 

• Formal Expression: A formal, computer encoding of the key terms and conditions, 
particularly the GeoLicence Extents. This encoded form of the GeoLicence may 
then be automatically enforced by the system, when the End-User requests access 
to the geospatial resource. 

Three aspects of GeoLicences are important: first, the expressions of the same licence 
should be compatible, in other words the legal, simplified and encoded expressions 
should capture the same essential meaning; second, GeoLicences may either be created as 
a result of human negotiation, or potentially automatically as the result of applying 
specific business rules; third, independently of how a GeoLicence is created, the same 
management and enforcement mechanism shall be used. 

7.4 GeoLicence Creation and Enforcement 

GeoLicences are the container to express the terms and conditions of a licensing 
agreement. GeoLicences may be granted subject to conditions of acknowledgement, or 
GeoLicences may be allocated based on a specific security and intelligence policy.  

GeoLicences are required, whether you charge for access to resource or not. 

GeoLicence creation and enforcement are separate workflows: 

• GeoLicence Creation: requires some form of negotiation to define terms and 
conditions.  

• GeoLicence Enforcement: Once GeoLicences have been created, the System can 
enforce the formal expression of the licence. In the event that the terms and 
conditions of the legal expression are breached, then legal measures may be 
applied. 

Note:  Given the limitations of the formal expression of the GeoLicence, it will not be feasible to 
implement a totally watertight system that prevents rights infringement or abuse. Rather, 
enforcement of the formal expression should be seen as complementing enforcement of the 
legal expression. 

7.5 GeoLicence Delegation and Management 

Geospatial DRM is essentially the process of creating, delegating, managing, tracking, 
validating and enforcing GeoLicences.  

The intention is that a GeoDRM-enabled network of services will automate some or all of 
these functions. Various actors within the GeoDRM-enabled system will perform these 
key functions. 

A key aspect of a scalable network is the ability to delegate responsibility to these actors 
in a controlled and managed way. The system would be unscalable if the administrative 
burden was placed on the content owner alone. 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 42 of 131 

Therefore a key capability for the success of a GeoDRM-enabled system is the ability to 
delegate these key functions. By necessity, intermediary actors may be needed to perform 
these administrative functions.  

Figure 9 illustrates the concept of GeoLicence delegation and management. Owner 
(Licensor) of the Intellectual Property can delegate the creation and management of 
GeoLicences to a Licensing Agent. Licensing Agents are granted the right (i.e. the 
authority) to issue GeoLicences subject to defined extents and conditions as defined in 
the agreement.  

In this example, the Owner of the Intellectual Property delegates the extents to be 
managed to a Licensing Agent, who then has authority to issue GeoLicences to a 
Licensee, who may then delegate work to be done by the End-User. The End-User may 
then request resource within the extents of the GeoLicence. Requests that fall within the 
GeoLicence extents are valid, where as those requests that fall outside the extents are 
invalid – a GeoLicensing violation. 

By encoding GeoLicences in a machine-readable way, GeoLicence enforcement becomes 
the mechanical process of checking that the extents of a request fall within the extents of 
the licence.

Figure 9: GeoLicence Delegation and Management 

In many ways we can consider the concept of GeoLicence delegation and management as 
being analogous to the way a real-estate owner may rent property in the real world. Often 
an intermediary letting agent will create and manage rental agreements on behalf of the 
real-estate owner. 
7.6 GeoLicence Chaining 

GeoLicences need to be traceable back to the Owner of the geospatial resource. 
GeoLicences may be “chained” where the Owner defines the top-level constraints and 
terms and conditions flow down the licence chain. GeoLicences are managed by the 
Licence Manager, and licences are validated back up the licence chain.

Figure 10: GeoLicence Chaining – supporting distributed licensing 

Figure 10 illustrates the concept of chaining geoLicences. This is a key concept that is 
needed to allow the delegation of licensing responsibility and supporting the need for the 
distributed licensing of geospatial resources.  
7.7 GeoLicensing Communities  

Data sharing between human beings requires the sharing of a common understanding of 
information structures and their meaning. This problem is known as the Triangle of 
Meaning, as it was first described by Ogden & Richards in 1923. Richards pointed out 
that words mean different things to different people in different situations. A more recent 
approach is to define communities in which the same meaning is shared for the purpose 
of communication. 

Thus, data sharing and trading tends to take place within communities of trading partners. 
Over time standard ways of exchanging information will evolve, for example, standard 
vocabularies to describe geographic features and processes, standard licence agreements 
or perhaps standardised pricing models. 

For the geospatial problem domain, the OGC has introduced the concept of an 
information community in their OpenGIS® Reference Model: 

“An information community is a collection of people [and organizations] (a government 
agency or group of agencies, a profession, a group of researchers in the same discipline, 
corporate partners cooperating on a project, etc.) who…share a common digital 
geographic information language and common spatial feature definitions. This implies a 
common world view as well as common abstractions, feature representations and 
metadata.” [OGC 03-040, p. 26] 

One example to achieve a common understanding for the exchange of geographic 
information is based in GML. It defines the structure (XML encoding) of geographic 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 44 of 131 

phenomena and their meaning and uses the GML namespace to make them 
distinguishable from other definitions. In order to actually exchange GML structured 
data, the declaration of an application schema is required, but is not permitted to change 
either the structure or the definition of GML’s predefined elements. 

Adopting this to the GeoDRM domain, a GeoLicence community can be characterized as 
a domain of participants (licensor, licensee, licence broker, service provider, etc.) that 
communicate to each other for the purpose of exchanging licensed geospatial data. In 
order to do so it is important that all members of the community obey the same structure 
of a licence (independent by which member it has been created or used) and to the 
meaning of rights, as they are expressed in the licence. This specification describes the 
means of a “default” GeoLicensing community by defining a Rights Model and the 
meaning for a set of predefined rights. In order to refer to these right definitions, a unique 
identification mechanism based on the URI notation shall be used. 

Because it cannot be sufficient to have one community only, it is possible to form other 
communities and structure relationships among them. Different GeoLicensing 
communities can exist for various reasons:  

(i) different business models,  

(ii) different legal rights systems, 

(iii) different organisational policies or  

(iv) broader / stricter definitions of particular rights.

Figure 11: An Example GeoCommunity – based on geography 

An example for different GeoLicensing communities, their hierarchy and relationships 
for Europe is illustrated in Figure 11: Europe is divided into a number of member states, 
with each member state divided into a number of regions. Allowing the concept of 
inheritance, the definitions and their meaning for Europe would also hold in France, 
Germany and Spain. In contrast to that, the GeoLicensing communities of France, 
Germany and Spain do not necessarily share the same meaning on defined rights.

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 45 of 131 

7.8 GeoLicensing and resource lineage 

Lineage or provenance of a geospatial resource is an important factor for both producer 
and consumer of geospatial information. Consumers need the assurance that the data is fit 
for purpose and can be used to support critical decisions, whereas providers require 
recognition for their contribution to a final information product. 

A GeoDRM-enabled set of processing resources will allow the lineage or provenance of 
the derived information product to be traced. As data is processed through a chain of 
processing resources, a “Process History” could be generated listing those resources that 
have been used to generate a derived product. 

7.9 Handling GeoLicence Violation – and the break-the-glass principle 

GeoLicence validation will be performed by the DRM Gatekeeper. Enforcement will be 
the combined responsibility of the associated Security system and the Gatekeeper. The 
Security system will verify the information passed to the Gatekeeper for the validation of 
the licence use. During the verification and validation of a GeoLicence, potential licence 
violations may be identified.  

The procedure of validation is based on the MPEG-21 Authorization model described in 
ISO 21000 (see [11]). This considers seven items of information associated to the request 
and the resources involved, as follows: 

1. Principals: the identity of the requestor, or other principals associated to him.  

2. Rights: the acts to be performed. 

3. Resources: the resources involved in the actions requested. 

4. Time: the time interval of the acts.  

5. Context: known-to-be-true facts and properties, independent of the request. 

6. Licence: licence elements applicable to the principal, act or resource. 

7. Trust Root: grants not requiring authorization.  

Given these seven data parts, the Gatekeeper has to answer one question: 
Is it permitted for a given Principal to perform a given Right upon a given 
Resource during a given time interval based on a given authorization 
context, a given set of Licences, and a given trust root? 

In addition, if a condition that requires a “side effect” (an outside action initiated by the 
use of a licence grant, put in place the licensor at the time the grant was issued) is 
activated, then the Gatekeeper will trigger those side effects with the timing specified in 
the original grant.  

If the Security system performs strictly, no actual violation will occur and the user will be 
informed of the “error” in his request (the lack of sufficient licence information). The 
user may also be passed information as a side effect of the attempted resource access.  

If the Security system is less strict, and allows the access requested despite the lack of 
Gatekeeper validation, then a licence violation would have occurred. In creating the 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 46 of 131 

context applicable to the resource in question, the Owner (or his agent) may place side 
affects to attempted use of invalid licences, which would include either the actions that 
the Owner feels appropriate to such attempts, or triggers that activate remediation efforts 
through the licence chair of agency, possibly all the way back to the Owner.  

Two general principles should be applied when a GeoLicence violation is identified:  

• First, the Owner is responsible for defining what action is performed in response 
to a licence violation.  

• Second, for those resources that may be needed in an emergency situation, the 
user should be able to override the licence conditions, that is to “break the glass”, 
and have unconstrained access to the resource. 

“Break-the-glass” options can be given in grants (given in the licence or in the trust root, 
parts 6 and 7 of the items above) having side effects, to allow identification of the 
principals who may use this option (part 1 of the seven items above) and the effects of the 
use of the option may be embedded as a side effect in those grants.  
7.10 Automated licence revocation/expiration – need to revoke privilege 

GeoLicences are revocable and can expire. Once a licence has been issued, a mechanism 
is needed to allow the licence to be revoked. This capability is needed for the scenario 
where the content owner needs to revoke rights to a resource, or where the licence has a 
limited lifetime and expires. 

The mechanism for revocation is usually associated to the Licensor metadata in the 
licence (see ISO 21000-5, [13]). The licensor informs the Gatekeeper or Security systems 
how to verify a licence document is still valid by including it with the information in the 
licensor “signature” included in or associated with the licence.  

8 GeoDRM Computational Viewpoint  

8.1 Overview: Roles and Responsibilities 

This clause sets out the basic operational concepts and entities in a GeoDRM system. 
Figure 12 shows the roles within a GeoDRM-enabled network of services. Within this 
model an individual person or organization may perform one or more of these roles in the 
network. In fact, because many of us currently perform a number of these roles at the 
same time, it is difficult to imagine other ways of doing business where the roles and 
responsibilities are allocated in a different way.  

In the following figure various roles have divided responsibilities, so they may be 
combined according to the needs of a specific business model. In many ways these roles 
can be thought of as the “primitives” that can be selected and assembled according to the 
specific needs of a business model.

Figure 12: GeoDRM Roles and Responsibilities 

Depending on the specific business model, roles may be combined in different ways. 
Figure 13 shows an example business model: Business A plays the roles of Owner, 
Licensing Agent and Service Provider; Business B plays the roles of Payment Provider 
and Licence Manager; and Business C plays the roles of Licensee and End-User. Other 
business models may make use of the same roles but configured in different ways. 

The End-User should not necessarily have full knowledge of the GeoLicence terms and 
conditions or how the GeoLicence was created. Instead, the End-User should be able to 
present a valid GeoLicence and be provided access to the Geospatial Resource based on 
those terms and conditions.

GeoDRM design goal is to make

possible to the End-User. 

 

A key challenge for the GeoDRM Reference Model is to create an abstract rights model 
with defined roles and responsibilities, which may then be combined in different 
configurations according to the specific needs of the business model. 

8.2 Principals 

Principals are the active entities of the systems: those that can initiate actions, such as 
requests. Most entities are associated to people and, by extension, to their presence on the 
net or in the system, i.e., their computers, software or, at least, their identity.  

One of the most common authorization tasks is the verification of identity of a principal.

Figure 14: Various Principals in a GeoDRM system 

8.3 Resource owner 

Owner principals are the controllers of the resources. The relationship between the Owner 
and the legal owner of a resource may be defined completely outside the system, such as 
by legal contracts, etc., but the root or all rights resides in the legal owner, and the Owner 
principal is the legal owners presence or agent within the system.  

8.4 Agent 

Agent principals are principals allowed to act in the stead of another principal, usually 
supported by a licence to do so. This sort of licence is akin to the limited power of an 
attorney in law, as it is seldom universal and will most likely restrict the acts of the agent 
to specific rights as contracted with the owner.  

Most Agent principal subtypes will multiply inherit (as interfaces) from Agent and as 
appropriate for the rights allocated to him by the other principal. There may be no manner 
for a user to distinguish whether he is working with and Agent or with the Licensor 
supporting the Agent’s licence to act. The Agent may have to present credentials to other 
principals to prove their right to act as agent for a Principal with a separate identity.  

8.5 Licence broker or licensing agent 

The Licensor principal in the system is the source of all licences. It is most often an agent 
of the owner acting in his stead, supported by legal contracts. If the Licensor principal is 
not the Owner, then there should be a contract reified as a licence available for 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 52 of 131 

verification to assure other principals that the Licensor is acting within his rights in 
issuing licences.  

The implementation of Licensor validation and authorization is essentially a metalevel in 
the rights management system, i.e. it is a system for licensing the act of creating licences. 

A Licensing Agent is an entity acting as a Licensor but not the Owner. By definition, a 
Licensing Agent is a type of Agent, since he is conducting the business of another 
principal.  

8.6 Service broker  

A Service Broker is an agent for one or more Service Providers that may combine 
multiple datasets and build licences based on existing agreed relationships. 

8.7 Service provider 

A Service Provider is a Principal who provides a Service.  

8.8 End-User 

An End-User is any object acting as a Licensee or any Agent of a Licensee (as a Sub-
Licensee. A Sub-Licensee is an Agent of a Licensee qualified to use all or some of the 
licences belonging to these Licensees.  

8.9 Licence Manager  

A Licence Manager is an application that tracks licences available within an organization 
and coordinates the issuing of these licences to requesting clients. 

9 Information Viewpoint 

9.1 Overview 

This clause sets out the basic information entities used to express rights in a GeoLicence 
in a GeoDRM system. These resource types are abstract, and implementations will differ 
based on the representation strategy. The information concepts here will be used to build 
the metadata described in Clause 9.3 and 9.5, including metadata for users, resources, 
licences, rights, and processes. 

The form of identity used for users, resources, licences, rights and processes is an 
implementation decision, but the obvious associations to the Internet will often suggest 
the use of elements of the forms URL, URI, URN and digital signatures.  

For copies of digital resources held by other than the issuing authorities, such as licences 
issued and copied to users, will be protected from modification by any acceptable means 
as may be specified in the design or standard definitions.  

Once striped of its protection and verified, most DRM processing consists of comparisons 
of fragments of metadata.  

For each process flow a set of comparisons can be formulated to assure that the DRM 
conditions for the act are satisfied. These comparisons must identify the following:

Each right can be associated to conditions based on the semantics of the right. Once a 
right is established its definition cannot change without affecting existing licences. 
Therefore, once defined and accepted as a standard, a right shall not change in its 
meaning or structure. Each right defined in the schema shall maintain its fundamental 
definition in the documents associated to the schema. Each right defined in an external 
registry will carry a dated definition in that registry.  

Further, once a licence is issued, it must not be changed (only the issuer prior to delivery 
may change a licence). A licence that needs to be modified shall be replaced by the 
issuer. This "frozen" nature of a licence is a fundamental part of the security and trust 
model within DRM, and once changed a licence is invalid.  

A licence shall specify an Issuer. The Issuer of a licence must have the right to grant 
rights specified in the licence 

9.2 User Metadata 

The basic user metadata is identity. Participants in a DRM system (principals in terms of 
ISO 21000) shall be identified uniquely, so that associations by reference can be traced to 
them.  
9.3 Properties and patterns 

In this reference model for the informational viewpoint, property formalisms were chosen 
to support the evaluation of conditions. In such formalisms, descriptors are associated to 
base objects, as opposed to embedded within them in attribute formalisms. In 
implementations, either formalism may be used since carry the same information. The 
property formalisms are more appropriate here since the actual structure of abstract 
classes, types and interfaces are not known.  

Property formalisms in implementations can be very flexible in handling ad hoc 
situations without the need to extend or modify classes. They have the disadvantage of 
requiring a more flexible and adjustable code, as structure is often being discovered at the 
same time that instance values are found. Implementations for document metadata using 
property formalism are quite common (for example, Microsoft® Office).  



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 55 of 131 

Attribute formalisms have the advantage of predetermined data structures, which can 
make a non-object-oriented code much simpler. The disadvantage is the lack of flexibility 
in ad hoc situations.   

Patterns are collections of conditions that define collections of entities. As such, it is easy 
to match a pattern to a particular instance, but difficult to enumerate the set that the 
pattern defines. For example, it is easy to ask, “Is this principal a US resident?”, meaning 
that there must be a verifiable property attached to the principal declaring his citizenship 
or resident status, but it is difficult to ask, “Who are the US residents?”, so much so that 
the US government tries for an accurate list only once every 10 years, during the census, 
after which there is a constant debate as to its accuracy until the next one is taken. 

All entities in this information model shall be “matchable” to patterns based on their 
attributes, properties and relations. All match requests return true if and only if verifiable 
information is available to assure a logical match. A failure to find such information shall 
always result in a “no match” or false result within or from the GeoDRM Gatekeeper.  

9.4 Resource Metadata 

9.4.1 General metadata 

The geoinformation or geoprocessing resources that are the target of the licence shall be 
identified unambiguously. This identification can be used to target local copies properly 
labelled or by accessing or retrieving a global networked copy of the resource. As defined 
in ISO 19109: Services, this identification should be location transparent, so that local or 
cached copies of the resource are treated as if they were the global copy of the resource.  

Some rights may be resource independent, in which case the resource part of a grant 
component may be unspecified.  

9.4.2 GeoInformation resource metadata 

When a resource is derived from the combination and/or modification of other resources, 
the new resource shall have appropriate metadata information associated to it that 
describes the processes and the parameter values used for those processes, which created 
the new resource 

9.4.3 GeoProcessing resource metadata  

In the paradigm discussed in Clause 6.3, processing resources are treated as resources not 
as acts. The application of a processing resource to another resource requires an execute 
right on the processing resource, and the appropriate right on the geoinformation as 
required by that processing resource’s metadata.  

Geoprocessing resources shall be identified by a registered processing step or steps. The 
steps are “registered” if they are defined in a recognized standard or other publicly 
available specification (at any level of development), identified by both the name and the 
version of the specification; and recognized as such is a trusted public registry, either 
supported by OGC or some other recognized body. The processing must be executed by 
viable software that is conformant to the defining standard.  



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 56 of 131 

For a specification for which no conformance test exists, or for other reasons, the 
Licensors may grant access to non-proven implementations under a licence by a fully 
specified name or by specifying "ANY" that would allow any implementation to be used.  

The default shall be to allow the licensed process to be carried out by any provably 
conformant implementation. Provably conformant means that the implementation is 
registered in a licensor-trusted registry, either globally, or locally.  

The usual process identification will be by URL, URI, or URN that identify the 
processing address or the registry entry in a licensor-trusted registry 
A service supplier may establish a special registry for any functionality that can 
manipulate GeoDRM extended resources. Such implementations shall be GeoDRM- 
enabled so that the licence metadata can be maintained.  

9.5 Licence Metadata 

9.5.1 Licence  

A licence is defined in ISO 21000-5 as an "expression that is created by Principals to 
conditionally or unconditionally permit the same or other Principals to perform Rights 
upon Resources." A Right is an act identified by the licence subject to any conditions 
associated with it in the licence. 

A licence is a sequence of grants. Each grant specifies a principal, which receives a right 
to act, and optionally, a resource upon which that right may be applied.  

9.5.2 Principal or Licensee 

Within a licence, most principal references within the rights grants may be patterns that 
are statements of the properties that would include a particular principal in the implied set 
of principals. This is not the case for the licensee, who is the principal actually contracted 
with the licensor (licensing agent) for the acquisition of the licence in question.  

9.5.3 Grants 

9.5.3.1 Semantics 

The grants within a licence are the actual listing of rights “granted” by the licence. As 
such they shall include at least the following information: 

• the person or persons to whom the rights is given, 

• the resource upon which the right may be exercised,  

• the rights which are granted, and  

• any conditions that modify any of the above.  

The GeoDRM Gatekeeper will be responsible for matching such grants with processing 
requests. Multiple resources may be involved in one request. Each grant in a licence may 
specify a separate resource. Consequently a request will only be authorized if, and only if, 
for each licensed resource in the request there is at least one grant, which match the 
particulars of the request, associated to the requestor in the licences.

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 57 of 131 

9.5.3.2 Rights 

9.5.3.2.1 Rights semantics 

A Right is defined in ISO 21000-5 as "an act identified by an r:Right" which is an 
element of a licence. Rights may generally be classified into (but are not necessarily 
limited to) the following categories: 

• Copyrights (©) that are legally defined rights granted to the original producer of 
certain types of works. They vary in nature between legal system, and not all 
entities of value are subject to copyright in a particular legal system.  

• Ownership rights that are legally defined rights inherent in the act of producing 
the resource, possibly in conjunction with copyrights. The Owner is the root of 
most other right grants.  

• Usage rights that are granted either by the owner or through legal mechanism 
(such as fair use in the United States) that allow principals to use a resource 
(entity) for some purpose. Each purpose is in effect a separate right.  

• Meta-rights that are rights to grant rights. 

• Management rights are those that perform acts on the entity as a whole without an 
interpretation of its meanings. Such rights might include copying, indexing, 
moving, change in formats or coordinate system. In such cases the actual resource 
is not used, but is only changed in format, location or inclusion in various aspects 
of a resource management systems.  

9.5.3.2.2 Note on Multiple copies of resource and Rights names 

When a resource exists in multiple identical copies, it may carry the same resource 
identity and be manipulated by licensees holding the appropriate rights on the resource. 
Any modification of the resource must result in a change of identity, and the addition of 
appropriate process metadata to aid in the tracking of rights back to the original resource 
owners (or their agents).  

The requirements for name formats vary from implementation to implementation, and the 
names for rights used here are not meant to be normative. In proving conformance, an 
implementation specification should map its specified right names to the ones here.  

9.5.3.2.3 Standards-defined operations 

Processes defined by standards can be identified by associations with their "proof of 
compliance." Since integration with the GeoDRM system will require compliance with 
DRM standards, they will carry both base functionality proof and GeoDRM proof of 
compliance.  

9.5.3.2.4 Usage Rights  

9.5.3.2.4.1 Use right  

The “Use” right allows a client to obtain a resource and have access to the information 
contained therein. It therefore subsumes all usage rights except Modify. Thus, many of 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 58 of 131 

the rights in the sections to follow may be collectively given by a single “Use” right. This 
right may be defined as a collection of the rights, or may be defined in a stand-alone 
manner, even in the absence of the finer detailed usage rights.  
9.5.3.2.4.2 View, Display, Print right 

The “View” right shall allow a licensee to view the resource as a map (properly scaled 
graphic representation, either vector or raster). This is the default minimal right, in that it 
is included almost universally in any licence that is of value. When the creation of 
derived or combined resource is allowed, the view right shall be licensable by the user 
holding the “derive” rights under which the resource was created. The limits of those 
licences may be restricted by that user’s rights condition. 

Since the usefulness of separating print, or display (such as from within an embedding 
document) from view is highly questionable; this specification does not distinguish 
between these. Implementation specifications may do so if the environments in which 
they work have a reason to do so. There is a technical issue that most browsers or other 
display software components are probably not DRM enabled and so separation of these 
rights may require acquisition of special display software to enforce them.  
9.5.3.2.4.3 Combine, merge right 

The “Combine” right shall allow a licensee to integrate the resource with other resources 
in a map in the same coordinate reference system. All input resources must carry this 
same combine right and be of the same information type (e.g. all images, all maps, all 
feature collections).  
9.5.3.2.4.4 Extract Resource or Copy right 

The “Extract Resource” right shall allow a licensee to create a fully software-accessible 
local copy of all or part of the resource subject to further GeoDRM controls on the local 
systems in support of a specified simultaneous number of identified licensed users.  

The “Copy” right shall allow a licensee to create one exact duplicate of the resource that 
can be stored locally subject to an equivalent right management system or for archival 
purposes. In this sense, the copy act is an extract resource act where the entire resource is 
extracted.  

Conformant geoservers may automatically get an extract right to maintain levels of 
performance. In which case, the local GeoDRM Gatekeeper shall be required to make 
judgements on these local resources based on the licences available to specific users. The 
logic in this is conformant servers are qualified to maintain the integrity of the licence-to-
resource relationship, and as such may act as a resource-provider agent of the owner 
without specific licence. This means that the required agent’s licence would be included 
in the local grant context of the GeoDRM Gatekeeper.  
9.5.3.2.4.5 Spatial Transform or Adjust right 

The “Spatial Transform” right shall allow a licensee to create a fully software-accessible 
local copy of the resource in a new coordinate system subject to further GeoDRM 
controls on the local systems in support of a specified simultaneous number of identified 
licensed users. The type of coordinate system can be restricted by conditions placed on 
this right.  

A slightly stronger “Spatial Fit” or “Adjust” allows a licensee to make minor adjustment 
in coordinates to fit an external source, such as a triangulated net or image. This is a 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 59 of 131 

common process when overlaying vector data upon image or scanned raster. Depending 
on the requirements of the process and potentially dependent on the accuracy of the data, 
the fitting may be done to the vector, to the raster or to both.  
9.5.3.2.4.6 Derive Resource or Further Develop right 

The “Derive Resource” right shall allow a licensee to create (derive) resources which use 
the licensed resource as an identifiable part, subject to GeoDRM controls consistent with 
the original licence. Associated conditions on this right may modify the rights allowed to 
be licensed on the derived resource. Other rights that create new resources from existing 
ones may be included in the derive resource right.  

9.5.3.2.4.7 Edit or Adapt right 

The “Edit” right shall allow a licensee to copy the resource into another resource in the 
original physical format and in the same coordinate reference system as the original, and 
to modify that new resource through edits. The “Adapt” right shall allow a licensee to use 
the resource in the creation of a new resource that may incorporate the original resource 
in whole or in part.  

This right extends to other coordinate reference systems if and only if a Spatial 
Transform or Adjust right is also granted in the same or a compatible licence.  

Since the new resource set is not the same as the original resource set, new source 
metadata should be associated to the edit portions of the copy of the resource.  

9.5.3.2.4.8 Modify Right 

The “Modify” right shall allow a licensee to edit the original resource set. In essence, this 
is the Edit or Adapt right with the additional capability to replace the original. 

Since the new resource set is not the same as the original resource set, new source 
metadata should be associated to the edit portions of the copy of the resource.  

If the resource identity includes a changeable date, then the original identity of the 
resource can be kept. The DRM system should allow interactions with distributed 
resource systems that allow all permanent "licensed" copies of the resource to be updated. 
The precise semantics of this temporal interaction is an implementation specification 
option. 

Ownership rights of the modified resource would follow the codicils of the licence, but 
the default logic would be that the ownership remains unchanged.  

9.5.3.2.4.9 Derive Graphic right 

The “Derive Graphic” right shall allow a licensee to create separate resources that 
correspond the transient views in View and Combine, subject to maintenance of a 
metadata trail back to the origin of the underlying resource.

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 60 of 131 

9.5.3.2.4.10 Encode right 

The "Encode" right shall allow a licensee to copy the original resource into a different 
type of encoding or representation. Conditions on format associated to this right shall 
specify which formats are allowable and which are explicitly excluded.  

9.5.3.2.4.11 Execute right 

The “Execute” right shall allow a licensee to use a processing resource to act on one or 
more other resources. For a request to be validated, execute rights must be found for the 
processing resource being used and for each parameter. If a parameter resource licence 
needs, it may reference the parameter by name.  

9.5.3.2.5 Meta-rights 

9.5.3.2.5.1 Semantics 

Meta-rights are rights associated to the granting or lending of licences to others based on 
grants through a valid licence chain of agency from the owner of the resource.  

9.5.3.2.5.2 License right 

The “License” right allows the principal holding the licence grant to grant others licences 
against the resource. The type of licences so granted shall be subject to conditions on the 
right grant.  

Note that the license right to grant a more basic right is not the same as the basic right. 
This means that a Licensing Agent of the Owner may be able to sell “view” licences to 
others, but unable to view the resource himself. Of course there would be little in the way 
of the agent from granting such a licence to himself, but that licence would be subject to 
the same conditions of any other licence so granted. So, in that case, the hypothetical 
agent would be subject to the same fees, constraints and conditions as his clients.  

9.5.3.2.5.3 Sublicense  

The “Sublicense” right allows the principal holding the licence grant to loan that right to 
others. The loaned licence will have no more rights than the original one, and shall be 
subject to conditions on the grant.  

9.5.3.3 Conditions 

9.5.3.3.1 Semantics 

Conditions specify limitations on rights. The following can be specified for any of the 
rights specified above.  

9.5.3.3.2 Property conditions and Grant Component patterns 

Any grant component can carry a set of named properties and operations (see the UML 
model). Any of these may be used in a licence to restrict the grant component in any way. 
For example, if we wish to grant everyone in the UK a right for a fixed period of time 
then the following grant structure may be used: 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 61 of 131 

• Grant 

o Principal 

 →location “Is Contained In” UK 

 Local NOW “Is Before” 1 January 2010 

o Resource = … 

o Right = view …  
This would grant any principal holding a location property that is spatially inside the UK 
to view the resource up until the first day of the year 2010 CE. Note the “→” notation 
used above is meant to parallel “dot” notation used in Object Basic programming 
languages, which is a context-sensitive object navigation, i.e. tracing a “[blank].” form to 
the context of the block. So in the 3rd line above, the “→location” means the 
“Principal→location” property. 

For the purpose of this “property checking” some global variables shall be made available 
to the GeoDRM Gatekeeper. These include but are not limited to: 

• the time and date (local and GMT), 

• the identity of the requestor, 

• the location of the GeoDRM Gatekeeper, and 

• any others as defined by the implementation specification.  
9.5.3.3.3 Standards-defined operations 

Processes defined by standards can be identified by associations with their "proof of 
compliance". Since integration with the GeoDRM system will require compliance with 
DRM standards, they will carry both base functionality proof and GeoDRM proof of 
compliance.  

9.5.3.3.4 Output conditions 

The licence may place conditions on the state of any “new” resource for each act 
(associated to a right) and for each named output of that act. The format of those 
conditions will usually be the assignment of meta-rights and properties for this new 
resource.  

So, if a grant defines a right “view” that produces an output map and for “extract” that 
produces an output resource, then the grant may use the following structure: 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 62 of 131 

• Grant 

o Principal = … 

o Resource = … 

o Right = view  

 Output→map 

• →Meta-rights = {view} 

• →Meta-data 

o →Disclaimer contains “This map contains privately 
own data of the UK Ordnance Survey.” 

o →Creation Date = NOW 

o Right = Extract 

 Output→resource 

• →Meta-rights = {view, extract} 

• →Meta-data 

o →Disclaimer contains “This information contains 
privately own data of the UK Ordnance Survey.” 

o →Creation Date = NOW 
9.5.3.3.5 Transfer Right and Sublicense conditions on meta-rights 

Meta-rights that allow one principal to enable another principal with grants, either as a 
licence or sublicence, may be restricted by the type of right so conveyed, or the persons 
or type of persons to whom the right may be conveyed. So a grant may contain the 
following type of structure:  



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 63 of 131 

• Grant 

o Principal = … 

o Resource = … 

o Right = view …  

o Right = extract … 

o Right = sublicense 

 Transfer = view 

 Sublicensee→organization = Principal→organization 

o Right = extract 

 Output→Resource 

• →Licence→”contains right”= {view} 

In this case the original licensee would have view and extract rights but could only 
sublicense view to anyone, and sublicense extract to members of his own organization.  

Other restrictions could be placed on these rights through property conditions.  
9.5.3.3.6 Spatial Temporal Conditions 

A spatial condition may limit the spatial or temporal extent of the resource that the 
actions allowed by the right may address. The expression of a spatial or temporal or 
spatiotemporal extent may be in any coordinate reference system or may cover multiple 
reference systems for subsets of the coordinates. The default CRS is WGS 84 Latitude-
Longitude (the CRS used by GPS), and the default temporal reference system is 
Universal Time (Zulu) (the TRS used by GPS).  

The semantics of the condition shall be specified. The parameter that is restricted should 
be explicitly given. For example, a pure temporal condition might indicate but is not 
restricted to one of the following: 

• Restrict access to resource originally collected within the time limits.  
• Restrict access to resource entered into the resource within the time limits.  
• Restrict access to the resource to the time limits.  
For example, a pure spatial condition might indicate but is not restricted to one of the 
following: 

• Restrict access to resource collected from within these limits.  
• Restrict access to users currently located within these limits. 
9.5.3.3.7 Layer conditions 

Layer conditions shall be used to limit what resource layers that can be used or modified 
in conjunction with a right. For resources, this shall subset the resource based on internal 
layer structures. For processing rights, this shall determine what types of layers shall be 
processible by the software, possibly regardless of the underlying resource.  



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 64 of 131 

For example, the right to use an image processing service might be restricted to “visible 
light” layers. The right to use a navigation service might be restricted to road layers 
appropriately augmented with network connectivity associations. Some examples are 
given below.  

The Massachusetts Roads Maintenance Agency is given the right to modify the roads 
layer of a combined New England database, as long as the records modified are part of 
Massachusetts road system, by the following grant form:  

• Grant 

o Principal = Massachusetts Roads Maintenance Agency 

o Resource = Combined New England SDI 

 →Layer = Roads… 

o Right = modify  

 Input→location “is contained in” Massachusetts 
The Massachusetts Emergency Dispatch is given the right to use navigation services 
against the roads layer of a combined New England database, as long as the records used 
are part sufficient for use by navigation systems, by the following grant form:  

• Grant 

o Principal = Massachusetts Emergency Dispatch 

o Resource = Combined New England SDI 

 →layer = Roads 

 →“accepted use” = navigation 

o Right = execute 

 Process  

• → Compliance = URN:OGC:NAVIGATE 
9.5.3.3.8 Implementation conditions 

Implementation rights shall be used to specify which implementations of functionality 
may be used in using a right. If unspecified, any provably conformant implementation of 
the functionality is allowed. If specific implementations are identified they may be 
allowed or disallowed specifically.  

This may be part of the trust model of the resource owner. For example, a company may 
wish to assure itself of the safety of the DRM by individually testing applications for 
what they consider a level of security. In this case, the company may put up an online 
directory of software implementations that have passed this rigid test, and the licences it 
issues of its resource might explicitly reference this online resource as the authority for 
what is to be considered “conformant” applications. More popular should be the 
restriction of a processing right to those implementations that are registered as 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 65 of 131 

conformant by the standards associated testing authority. Thus, one licensor may require 
that his resource only be served with an OGC-compliant implementation listed in the 
OGC registry supported by the Open Geospatial Consortium.  

The default assumption is "open world" that is, all conformant implementations are 
allowed unless specifically disallowed. If this is not the intent, the licence should specify 
a "NULL" specification-based right, and then specifically allow other implementations. 
An unmodified "NULL" specification effectively nullifies the right.  

9.5.3.3.9 Parameter Range conditions 

In functional rights that pass parameters, the allowable range of any parameter may be 
limited. The format of the range is type specific. For parameters that do not have any 
ordering or dimensional structure, the usual representation is a "white space separated" 
list of values. Values with internal white space should be quoted or the white space 
escaped appropriately for the licensing encoding mechanism being used. For ordered or 
dimensionally structured parameters, a set of ranges or extents should be specified in 
accordance to the semantics of the parameter type.  

For example, to change an earlier example to only allow viewing of Boston roads, 
assuming the view parameters are layer, extent and style, then the following grant could 
be used: 

• Grant 

o Principal = … 

o Resource = … 

o Right = view  

 →extent “is contained within” Boston 
9.5.3.3.10 Derived Right conditions 

If the right to derive resources is granted then the condition DerivedRight may be used to 
restrict or expand the rights that may be licensed by the creator of the derived resource in 
conjunction with the derived resource.  

For example, if a feature resource supplier wishes to assure the manner in which his 
resource is used “second hand” through another process, then he may require the derived 
right to be “view only with citation”. This might use a licence pattern such as follows: 

• Grant 

o Principal = … 

o Resource = … 

o Right = view  

 →metadata “contains citation” Licensor→citation 
Another user wishing to use the same resource would then be forced to go to the original 
source since the first user could not convey rights other than view to his derived resource. 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 66 of 131 

For this reason, any derived right shall implicitly include the right to view a graphics 
rendition of the resource. 

• Grant 

o Principal = … 

o Resource = … 

o Right = extract  

 →metadata “contains citation” Licensor→citation 
9.5.3.3.11 Encoding condition 

If a right to duplicate or derive resources is given, the Encoding condition may restrict the 
form in which the particular resource may be presented. If absent, the default logic of the 
condition is that all lossless encodings are allowed.  

Encoding conditions may apply to any aspect of the encoding or presentation processes. 
For example, if an image is originally spectrally encoded (such as an RGB for visible 
light), then the licensor may choose to reject transformation of that into HSI (hue, 
saturation, intensity) encodings.  

• Grant 

o Principal = … 

o Resource = … 

o Right = encode  

 →format is not HSI 
9.5.3.3.12 Side effect conditions 

The use of a right may have side effects listed in the contract. To support this, each right 
may be associated to the conditions that cause the GeoDRM Gatekeeper to add processes 
to the process flows. The return value of these extra processes may affect the completion 
of the action.  

Precondition side effects may execute extra checks on the licence, may cause extra 
validation on the resource or be linked into the billing system of the Licensor.  

Postcondition side effects may cause extra validation on the output resources or be linked 
into the billing system of the Licensor. Such conditions may use the following grant 
structure  

• Grant… 
o Right 

 Condition Side Effect 
• →Time = before use 
• →Service Request (… Text of request …)

9.5.4 Issuer 

The issuer of the licence identifies the entity that created and built this licence. The Issuer 
is the last entity allowed to modify a licence. Once issued, the licence shall not be 
modified by anyone. Changes to a licence shall be accomplished by a new licence being 
issued. 

The issuer must have the rights to issue licences for his licences to be valid. This means 
that an Issuer is the owner of the resource or a representative of the owner of the resource 
and is either acting in his name or as his agent. 

The following of this rights chain back to the "owner" is the responsibility of some entity 
playing the Licence manager role. 

To perform these functions, the issuer shall be associated to metadata on his identity and 
his relations as agents of others, in particular, his agency or chain of agency for the 
owners of the resources for which he grants licences.  

9.6 Process metadata 

Process metadata describes processes, such as services and software. It is used to identify 
each process implementation for licensing, either as licensing for the process itself or for 
the use of that process on a particular resource. It is also used as resource metadata to 
track the processing history of that resource. 

In general, a processing resource can become part of a DRM system in one of two basic 
manners (albeit, variations are possible and acceptable). First, the process can be an 
implementation of a DRM standard, which makes it DRM aware. Such processing 
resources are called “trusted” in the sense that they do not break any DRM rules that 
would allow DRM aspects to be bypassed. Second, the process may be isolated within a 
DRM system that controls all of its communication with outside entities, acting as a 
“rights firewall” preventing resource leakage into uncontrolled environments. This 
second type is DRM embedded.

Annex A   
Abstract Test Suite 

A.1 Items covered 

This standard creates conceptual requirements for the following: 
1. Rights expression languages. 

2. Metadata for identification of principals, processes, rights and resources. 

3. GeoDRM Gatekeeper components for use in protection and enforcement systems, 
including GeoDRM as a requirement. 

A.2 Rights expression languages 

Rights expression languages are used to create GeoLicences with unambiguous 
meanings, as specified in this standard.  

A rights expression language (REL) conformant to the standard must support the rights 
model defined in Clause 9.5.3.2 Rights. It must further integrate with at least one other 
rights expression language that covers non-geographic entities that are encountered in GI 
systems.  

A.3 GeoDRM Metadata systems for GeoDRM 

A GeoDRM metadata system, as a subsystem of a GI system shall assure that metadata 
associated to the maintenance of rights associated to GI are preserved. For a GeoDRM 
metadata system to be fully conformant, it shall be difficult to a stated degree to violate a 
GeoLicence within its control.  

A.4 GeoDRM Gatekeeper  

A GeoDRM protection and enforcement system is a security system that prevents any act 
unless supported by a licence; either a general public licence for those acts open to all 
users, or a more specific licence whose principal range is limited. It must be, or contain, a 
compliant GeoDRM metadata system and a GeoDRM Gatekeeper. It must include 
specification for:  

• a rights expression language, 

• a condition expression language (possibly based on SQL or OQL), 

• a GeoDRM Gatekeeper specification, and  

• a GeoDRM Metadata specification.

Annex B  (informative) 
GeoDRM UML Model 

B.1 Semantics 

The following UML model represents a valid interpretation of the information model 
presented in Clause 9, Information Viewpoint. 

UML 2.0 definitions of interface were used. If a translation to UML 1.5 or earlier is 
desired, all stereotyped <<interface>> classifiers should be changed to stereotype 
<<type>>. The two models under the two versions of UML will be logically equivalent.  

The rest of this annex is a documentation format provided by a UML tool (Enterprise 
Architect, from SparxSystems, Ltd. Australia (http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/). It has 
been edited for format, but the content reflects the GeoDRM model posted on the Open 
Geospatial Consortium portal.  

Alternative UML models consistent with Clause 9, Information Viewpoint are possible, 
but they should be information equivalent to the one contained here.

Table B – 16: Condition Attributes  

Attribute Type Notes 

 expression  public static : 
string  

The expression is a logical statement that 
evaluates to a TRUE, FALSE or 
INDETERMINATE (should be an error). Each 
variable in the statement should map to 
elements or attributes of grants to which this 
condition is applied, to the resource, to the user 
making the request, or to the request being 
made. Evaluation of any of the conditions 
associated to a right to false or indeterminate 
will invalidate the use of that licence grant in 
the given circumstances.

Request)   

public: 
boolean   

param: grant [ Grant - in ]   

param: request [ Request - in ]   

 
The operation "evaluates" the condition based 
on the current circumstances presented to the 
GeoDRM Gatekeeper. The evaluation of any 
condition associated to a grant would invalidate 
the use of that grant to authorize an act. The 
failure of all grants to validate a right to act, 
would normally cause the GeoDRM Gatekeeper 
to invalidate the request presented to it.

A Data resource is, as the name implies, data. Metadata associated to the Data resources 
include the owner of the data (for licensing purposes) and any schema information. Other 
Metadata may also be available.  The schema can be used to select parts of a Data 
resource based on query. These parts can be specified in a licence by using conditions 
equivalent to the selection query.

B.37 Principal  

Type:  public abstract «interface» Interface  {abstract} 
  Extends: GrantComponent.   

Package: GeoLicence 

Principal is the root class of all participants in the systems. Subclasses of Principal can 
add further information needed to support the role that principal will play in the processes 
of the GeoDRM system. A group of principals is also a principal, and the group may take 
actions (such as obtaining a licence) which would normally be considered the act of a 
single entity. In other words, an individual has a right if he is a member of a group that 
has been granted that right. The basic metadata for any principal is identity, allowing that 
principal to be, without significant doubt, identified. A principal can have multiple 
identities, but each identity can only apply to one principal or one principal group.

B.45 Resource  

Type:  public abstract «interface» Interface  {abstract} 
  Extends: GrantComponent.   

Package: GeoLicence 

A resource is any data, functionality, or any other entity subject to licensing. A resource 
metadata must, at a minimum, identify the resource and be traceable to its owner or an 
agent of its owner.

Each Resource is "owned" or 
under the complete control of a 
principal, or some number of 
principals. Each owner has the 
right to grant licences on the 
resource. This includes a 
general licence to grant other 
licences. In a GeoDRM 
system, all licences are 
eventually traceable back 
through a series of licences to 
the owner of the resource.

Method Type Notes 

 getOwner ()   «get» 
public: Owner   

The getOwner operation is a convenience 
function that tracks from this resource to 
its owner or one of the owner's agents 
(another principal of the system). This is 
used to validate licences since the 
licensor must be an agent (or transitive 
agent) of the owner.   

 

B.46 Right  

Type:  public abstract «interface» Interface  {abstract}

A right is any act that can access the resource in any manner. Rights are often associated 
to the process standard that implements them. Right metadata includes any information 
needed to identify the action that a request may make using this right.

B.51 SideEffect  

Type:  public abstract «interface» Interface  {abstract} 
  Extends: Condition.   

Package: GeoLicence 

Side effects are conditions that cause a logically unrelated action to occur. Such actions 
are usually required by the contract that the licence represents. The evaluate function, 



GeoDRM RM v 1.0.0 GeoDRM Reference Model 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial 
Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 114 of 131 

inherited from Condition, will return true if the side effect does not uncover any reason to 
interrupt the flow. If a side effect has a time set beyond the end of the act, i.e. if the effect 
is to occur later than the successful completion of the licensed act, the return value of the 
Condition::evaluate function should always be true. Among other things, this would 
allow an emergency-inspired "break the glass" action to be reviewed after the crisis that 
spawned the emergency was handled.

Attribute Type Notes 

 time  public static  
Range:0 to 1: 
string  

The attribute "time" is a temporal relation 
string, relating the side effect action to 
the licensed act. Common values are 
"before" or "after." 

Initial Value: "before";  

 type  public static: 
string  

The attribute "type" is a string describing 
the side effect action. It acts as 
instructions to the GeoDRM Gatekeeper 
to execute the side effect. Normal values 
include, message to licensor, user 
message, service call, function call or 
similar remote invocation technique.  

Initial Value: "message to user";  

 request  public static: 
any  

The attribute "request" is a representation 
of the invocation of the side effect action. 
If the type is a message, then the request, 
possibly with parameterized content, 
could be the content of the message.

Annex C  
Scenarios  

C.1 Introduction 

This annex describes some example scenarios to illustrate how a GeoDRM-enabled 
system may handle the creation, distribution and enforcement of GeoLicences. The 
example scenarios are based on a GeoDRM Game, which we have used within the 
GeoDRM Working Group to understand the logic of distributed licence management. 

The purpose of the GeoDRM game was to: 

• To understand the roles and responsibilities within a GeoDRM network. 

• To separate the logic of managing intellectual property from the content.  

• To use a simplified game to simulate the real-world problem. 

• To make the abstract problem of digital rights management more understandable 
in concrete terms. 

Players were assigned to each of the identified roles and a given licensing scenario, 
played out using a pack of standard playing cards to represent the content and cardboard 
templates to represent licences. 

The implementation of a GeoDRM-enabled solution will be based on this metaphor, and 
a similar sequence of electronic transactions will be needed in the digital world.

Figure C – 1: GeoDRM Game – Interactive Role Playing 

Each round of the game was used to play out the scenarios as below and was used as a 
way to understand the dynamic and distributed nature of GeoLicence management. 

C.2 Scenario 1: User accesses content from single provider  

In this scenario there is a single service provider serving the suit of hearts. The scenario 
that was played out was to create a licence to access the 7, 8 and 9 of hearts, represented 
by the blue block, and enforce that licence to access the content.

Figure C – 3: Workflow for creating and enforcing a licence 

The workflow starts with the owner who (1) defines the extents of the intellectual 
property delegated to the service provider. Service provider is responsible for serving the 
suit of hearts and enforces the constraints defined in the licence. The owner then 
delegates (2) the extents to be licensed to the licensing agent.  

Licensing agent is responsible for creating and granting licences (3) to a licensee. A copy 
of the licence is then registered with licence manager, and licensee then delegates the

Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Page 126 of 131 

licence extents (4) to the end-user. End-user may then request data (5) from the service 
provider, who then uses the extents of the request (6) to retrieve the licence and extents 
delegated to the end-user (7) and returns them to the service provider. Service provider is 
responsible for enforcing the licence and returning the requested content (8) back to the 
end-user. 

As identified in 8.1 Overview: Roles and Responsibilities, these roles may be performed 
by the same entity, depending on the specific business model. Second, once a licence has 
been created it may be used as many times as required by the end-user to access the 
content. 

C.3 Scenario 2: Overlaying content from multiple providers 

This scenario introduces the more realistic situation where an end-user needs to access 
content from multiple providers, each serving data for different owners. A single 
licensing agent and licence manager is used to create a licence to manage and protect 
access to the content.

Figure C – 4: Overlaying content from multiple providers 

We can imagine that content represented by the various suits of cards represents towns, 
roads and rivers data. The end-user accesses each of these resources to create a combined 
resource overlaying the town, roads and rivers data for a given geographical extent.

Figure C – 5: Workflow licensed access to content from multiple providers  

In this workflow each of the owners delegate the content to service providers who are 
responsible for serving the towns, roads and rivers data respectively. Then each owner 
delegates the extent to be licensed (1) to the licensing agent. 

Licensing agent then creates a licence (or licences) to be granted to the licensee. A copy 
of that licence is registered with the licence manager (4), and a sublicence granted to the 
end-user.  

End-user can request access to the content (5), with each service provider retrieving a 
valid licence (6) from the licence manager, enforcing the constraints of the licence, and 
finally returning the response (7) back to the end-user. 

C.4 Scenario 3: Joining content from multiple providers 

This scenario is similar to Scenario 2, but instead of combining content of different types 
it represents the scenario of accessing the same content type from multiple providers. In 
this scenario we imagine each of the suits of cards to represent content of the roads data 
type, but being served by multiple providers.

Figure C – 6: Joining resources from multiple providers 

The conclusion from playing out this scenario was that the workflow logic from a 
licensing perspective was the same as that for Scenario 2.  

C.5 Scenario 4: Derived resource adding content 

This scenario represents the joining of multiple datasets and adding additional content. It 
is based on the idea that the output generated by Scenario being combined with additional 
content. In other words, the combined roads data is overlaid with pubs data to create a 
new derived product. Recall from Clause 1, that a GeoDRM system must be necessary 
and sufficient. In this case this means that the tracking of derived products must match 
the contractual agreement between licensee and licensor.

Figure C – 7: Derived resource adding content 

The derived product now contains information content from multiple owners. This 
information may have been manipulated in a manner consistent with the licences 
involved. The GeoDRM system should allow the contribution of each owner to be 
recognised and tracked as required by the licence.

Annex D  
Editor’s notes 

D.1 The spelling of licence in its various forms 

This document follows the Oxford English Dictionary spelling of “licence” (as opposed 
to “license”) when used as a noun. When used as a verb, or a verb form, the term is 
“license.” Hence, the phrase “a licence is licensed to a licensee by a licensor during the 
licensing process” is in fact spelled correctly, albeit a bit confusing.
