 WEB REGISTRY SERVER DISCUSSION PAPER 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 
 
This is the first draft of a specification of a Web Registry Server. This document is based 
on the experience gained in the WMT Stateless Catalog prototype efforts and the 
discussions in the WMT2 telecons and the Catalog Revision Working Group. This is the 
first  attempt to cast the stateless catalog as a first class service OWS and collect and  
formalize  the experience gained in the populating the catalog. This specification has not 
been reviewed by the other team members and  represents the editor’s view of those 
activities. This is a draft and may change significantly based on reviews and the evolution 
of the Basic/General Services Model. 
 
There many technical issues that need to be discussed and resolved including: 

• Do others agree with this view of the evolution of the the Stateless catalogs into a Web 
Registry Service with service description registration and update as a formal 
interface and the use of GetCapabilities to substitute for the Explain capabilities in 
the OGC Catalog Specification  

• Will the same service registry catalog WMS, WFS and WCS. If so how different are the 
metadata. For example is a Feature Type or a Feature Collection the correct granularity for 
a registry descriptor and how does it's metadata vary from that of a mapping layer  

• If we decide that the Registry descriptors need an incremental update service for 
scalability, can service providers use the WFS transaction interface to specify the required 
updates 

• The specification of the Registry descriptor contents and schema are equivalent/dependant 
on the same research as the Basic/General Service Model. How should the two efforts 
interact 

• Is the full GetDescriptors service interface acceptable for lightweight clients or should we 
maintain a GetDescriptors profile with defaults similar to those of the Stateless Catalog 
prototypes

PREFACE 
This document describes the OGC Web Registry Server (WRS) interfaces. The WRS interfaces 
support “one stop shopiing” for the registration, metadata harvesting and descriptor ingest,  push and 
pull update of descriptors, and discovery of OGC Web Service types and instances using HTTP as 
the distributed computing platform.  

STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT 
This specification is a draft document submitted to OGC for review and may be updated, replaced or 
obsoleted by other documents at any time. Considering the early stages of this specification it is 
inappropriate to use it as  reference material or cite this document as other than “work in progress”. 
The purpose of this document is to be the basis of an OGC Discussion paper as described in the 
OGC Policies and Procedures. This document is dependant on the OGC Basic Service Model for the 
definition of the general semantics, exception handling and the definition of the GetCapabilities 
operation.

This specification should form the basis of a new Web Services Volume of the OGC Bookshelf. 

OVERVIEW   
Motivation 
Phase 2 of the Web Mapping Testbed (WMT2) resulted in several candidate OGC interface 
specifications for operations on a Web Map Server (WMS), Web Coverage Server (WCS) or Web 
Feature Server (WFS).  The specs all differ in their purposes and details, but a number of elements 
are common to most or all of them. There was a desire by service users to have a single entry point 
(or at most a few) and protocol to search for service types of interest. In order to meet this goal, 
there needs to be an interface that populates a database of service descriptions and an interface to 
query the description database to discover service locations. This document specifies a Registry 
Service framework that operates in a stateless HTTP environment. This allows service type 
discovery using a single catalog site rather than visiting each server and using GetCapabilities 
operations.  
 This specification is mapped to the OGC Catalog Service version 1 and is intended to be 
consistent with the OGC Catalog Service version 1.1. This is intended to allow Web Registries to 
interoperate with stateful catalogs implementing the OGC Catalog Service in service discovery.  

Terminology (Editor’s note must Update) 
A service is one of the types of functionality described in this document and its companion 
volumes. 
A service instance is a particular host computer that offers a service. 
An operation is a combination of a client's request that a service instance perform an action and a 
server's response to that request. 
An interface is a collection of one or more operations by which a service interacts with the external 
environment.  A service instance establishes a particular network connection point as its interface. 
A protocol specifies the mechanism and format for submitting an operation request and receiving a 
response.  Various different computing platforms may use different protocols for the same 
operations. 



OpenGIS Project Document 01-024r1 2001-03-20 PAGE 5 

As an analogy, if we apply this terminology to the World Wide Web then access to documents and 
multimedia objects is a service, a web site is a service instance, HTTP is a protocol, and HTTP 
GET is an operation combining a request for an object and a response containing that object. 
A geodata object is a unit of geospatial informational content that can be requested from an OGC 
Web Service.  For example, a feature collection, a map layer, and a coverage are all geodata 
objects. 

Document Organization (Editor’s note TBS) 

BACKGROUND 
Web Mapping Testbed phase 1 (WMT1) resulted in two specifications: "OpenGIS Web Map 
Server Interface Implementation Specification" version 1, and "OpenGIS Recommendation - 
Geography Markup Language" (GML) v.1.  These documents were the result of a consensus 
development process by WMT1 sponsors and participants and were approved by the full OGC 
membership.  GML is an XML-based encoding of geographic features, and is described elsewhere; 
being a file format, GML does not itself specify any operations.  The WMS 1.0 specification was 
an important first step towards interoperable access to georeferenced information, but it does have 
a number of acknowledged limitations.  The goal of Web Mapping Testbed phase 2, and a 
simultaneous Geospatial Fusion Services (GFS) testbed, was to advance the state of affairs by 
enhancing the WMS spec and creating new standards for Web Coverage Server, Web Feature 
Server, GeoParser, GeoCoder, GeoLinker, and others. 
Web Map, Feature and Coverage Servers--collectively called OGC Web Services--are each the 
subject of detailed specifications.  They are described conceptually in the next section as 
background material. 

Architecture Overview 
WMT 2 Overview 
 
Three principal types of georeferenced information access services have been defined by WMT2: 
Web Map Server (WMS), Web Coverage Server (WCS), and Web Feature Server (WFS).  In 
addition, the Geospatial Fusion Services (GFS) Testbed defined services that return spatially 
referenced results: GeoParser, GeoCoder, and GeoLinker.  Collectively, such services are referred 
to as OGC Web Services (OWS).  Figure 5-1 is an architecture diagram showing conceptually how 
these components are related, and naming some (not all) of the interfaces between them.  The 
subject of this document and its companion volumes is the interfaces.  The internal details of the 
components are irrelevant; vendors may build them in any manner that correctly implements the 
required interfaces. This version of the figure emphasises the interfaces/operations proposed for 
the Web Registry Server (WRS) and how they would fit into the OGC Web Services 



OpenGIS Project Document 01-024r1 2001-03-20 PAGE 6 

architecture.

  
Figure 1:WMT2 Architectue emphasizing Web Registry Server 

 (EDITOR’s note: Figure needs to be smoothed). 

  

Each service has several required operations, but it is not required that the same software or internet host 
computer implement all of them.  For example, a WMS may offer GetMap directly but allow its 
GetCapabilities response to be handled by another machine on its behalf.  The service metadata in 
Capabilities XML includes distinct online resource addresses (e.g., HTTP URLs) for each service offered.  
There is no requirement in this specification dictating the format or content of those URLs; rather, this 
document describes only the packaging of the query parameters that must be appended to the service 
URL. 

 

Overview of OGC Catalog Specification 
 
Figure 2 shows the general service interfaces. These interfaces allow the discovery, access and 
management of geospatial data and services.  This model is based on the concept of interface 
operations passing Request – Response Message Pairs between a client and a server.  Stated 
another way, this architecture uses a messaging based structure to describe the access and 
invocation of Catalog services.  
As seen in Figure 2 there are four major interfaces, CG_CatalogService, CG_Discovery, 
CG_Access and CG_CatalogManager. These are described in more detail in the following sections 



OpenGIS Project Document 01-024r1 2001-03-20 PAGE 7 

of this document.  The taxonomy of interfaces that have been placed above the CG_CatalogService 
interface (i.e., OGC_Service and OGC_Stateful) have been created to put forth the idea of having 
an overall architectural framework for the different services that will be developed over time to 
populate the OGC Service Architecture.

Catalog Implementation 

 
This specification defines stateless versions of the CG_CatalogService, the CG_Discovery and the 
CG_CatalogManager interfaces which are intended to support lightweight clients  and servers that 
support HTTP version 1.0 type functionality and do not necessarily maintain information required 
to enable persistent sessions. 

 
 
Interfaces 
To support service discovery the WMT Registry Server must support the following interfaces:  
 
<GetCapabilities> 
       A server must be able to describe its capabilities. Specifically, it must indicate which query 
languages, namespaces, return schema and return formats it supports. This service is similar to the 



OpenGIS Project Document 01-024r1 2001-03-20 PAGE 8 

the non-session oriented portions of the CG_CatalogService Interface in the OGC Catalog Service 
Specification  
 
<GetDescriptor> 
       A registry server must be able to respond to client queries in at least one of a number of 
predefined query languages and return the results of those queries in at least one of a number of 
predefined formats. This interface is similar to the CG_Discovery Interface in the OGC Catalog 
Service Specification 
 
To support Open Server Registration and Periodic Content Harvesting the Web Registry Server 
may support the following interfaces: 
 
 
<RegisterService>  
 Web Registry Server may allow service provider's to register their servers online, request periodic 
update thru the harvesting of capabilities documents from the server or the adhoc update of the 
descriptors data base by transaction or in bulk 
 

Request Semantics 
 
This service is intended to comply to chapters 4 and 5 of OGC WMT2 Basic Services Model. 
HTTP defines two methods of exchanging information with a web server; the GET method and the 
POST method.  
 
GET Method  
 
       With the GET method, a request is encoded into the URI that is sent to the web server. The 
main limitations of GET are: The length of the URI has a hard limit (typically set by the browser 
being used) which limits the size of a web feature server request.  It is difficult (if not impossible) 
for complicated MIME messages to be sent from the client to the server using the GET method. 
 
POST Method  
 
       A POST request can be arbitrarily long and complex which means that client applications can 
generate long and complex query structures  
 
The following table correlates WRS interfaces and request semantics:  
 
  Interface                            Request Semantics 
  <GetDescriptors>                            POST + limited GET 
  <RegisterService>                            POST + GET 
  <GetCapabilities>                            POST + GET 
 
 



OpenGIS Project Document 01-024r1 2001-03-20 PAGE 9 

The main body of this document defines the interfaces in a form suitable for packaging as an 
HTTP POST request. The prototype implementations which are discussed in Annex A use the 
GET syntax. 

<GETCAPABILITIES> INTERFACE 
A  WRS must be able to describe its capabilities. Specifically, it must indicate which interfaces, 
query languages, namespaces, return schema and return formats it supports. The Normative 
specification for the <GetCababilities> Interface in given in the WMT Basic Services Model. This 
section provides the details of this interface for a WRS. This service is similar  to the non-session 
oriented portions of the CG_CatalogService Interface in the OGC Catalog Service Specification. 
.  The normative portions of BSM 1.0 must be considered an integral and mandatory part 
of this WRS specification. The purpose of the GetCapabilities operation is specified in 
BSM 1.0 [17].  Refer to that document for additional mandatory information regarding 
GetCapabilities.  
 
For the particular case of a Web Registry Server, the response of a GetCapabilities 
request is general information about the service itself and specific information about the 
available attribute namespaces, query languages and element sets. 
 

GetCapabilities Request  
Overview 
The general form of a GetCapabilities request is defined in BSM 1.0 [17].  When making this request of a 
WRS, which may offer other OGC Web Services as well, it is necessary to indicate that the client seeks 
information about the WRS in particular.  Thus, the SERVICE parameter of the request must have the 
value "WRS" as shown in the table below. 

 

URL Component Required/ 
Optional

Request Parameters 
Prefix 

The role of the URL prefix is specified in BSM 1.0 [17]. The prefixes for GetCapabilities, GetMap and 
GetFeature info may be different. 
VERSION 

This parameter is specified in BSM 1.0 [17]. 

 



OpenGIS Project Document 01-024r1 2001-03-20 PAGE 10 

REQUEST 

This nature of this parameter is specified in BSM 1.0 [17].  For GetCapabilities, the value "GetCapabilities" 
must be used. 
 

SERVICE 
This nature of this parameter is specified in BSM 1.0 [17].  When invoking GetCapabilities on a 
WRS the value "WRS" must be used. 

 

GetCapabilities Response 

 
(Editor’s note Annex B is TBS) 
 
BSM 1.0 [17] specifies general rules about the GetCapabilities response. 

In the particular case of a Web Repository Server complying with version 1.0.0 of this standard, the 
Extensible Markup Language (XML)[9] response must be valid according to the XML Schema in Appendix 
B of this document. The Schema specifies the required and optional content of the response and how the 
content is formatted.

The GetDescriptors request document is described by the following DTD. Parameterswhich 
require enumerations or defaults are expressed using attributes because of DTD limitations. This 
DTD is appropriate for use with an HTTP Post request. Annex A.1 shows the HTTP Get form of 
this request used by the WMT2 Prototype implementations

<REGISTERSERVICE> INTERFACE 
 
A WRS may want to enable service providers to register their services and have the WRS ingest 
their current capabilities document and create appropriate service descriptors in the WRS 
descriptor storage. The WRS may also provide the capability to automatically update the 
descriptor base for a service on a predefined schedule or based on adhoc requests. This set of 
operations is provided by the Register Service Interface. These operations are similar in 
functionality to the CG_CatalogManager interface .

The basic processing model is that clients would do a search with a 'brief' or 'summary' element (in 
the ESN parameter) to retrieve a condensed version of the service of interest and then, if needed, 
could retrieve the full element set through the DOCID parameter (extracted from the brief or 
summary element set). 
 
E.g. 
<http://lennier.gsfc.nasa.gov:8080/wmt/search.pl?QUERY=title+like+%27%25coastlines%25%27
