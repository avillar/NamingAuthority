i. Abstract 

This OGC standard specifies parameters to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) GetCov-
erage request which give control over interpolation of a coverage during its server-side pro-
cessing. This allows the client (user) to control and specify the interpolation mechanism to be 
applied to a coverage during server processing. 

This WCS Interpolation extension relies on WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4] and the GML Appli-
cation Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

Introduction 

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) –Interpolation Extension defines an extension to the 
WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4] to control interpolation during processing of a GetCoverage 
request. This affects all operations that require interpolation, such as scaling and CRS 
change. 

Note As such, this Interpolation Extension has impact on the operational behaviour described in 
other WCS extensions, such as the ones mentioned above. 

On principle, the set of interpolation types supported is a property of a coverage. Actually, 
interpolation can be even more localized and constitute a property of particular coverage axes 
and on particular bands. For example, a coverage may undergo linear interpolation along 
lat/long axes and nearest neighbour interpolation along time. 

However, modelling interpolation this fine-grain would pose severe load on WCS implemen-
tations and concrete services. Server implementation is complicated substantially by a dy-
namic per-axis choice of interpolation methods applied. Reporting interpolation capabilities 
with individual coverages would lead to substantially larger metadata, and would substantial-
ly complicate client-side handling of this information.  

Therefore, a mixed approach has been adopted. In the core conformance class of this stand-
ard, one interpolation method can be selected by the client which subsequently gets applied 
along all coverage axes simultaneously. In an optional further conformance class, interpola-
tion-per-axis, for each axis an override can be indicated using a different interpolation meth-
od. 

Interpolation methods available are reported by the service in its GetCapabilities response; a 
normative set of specific interpolation techniques  is provided by OGC Abstract Topic 6  
(which is identical to ISO 19123) [1]; OGC-NA might normatively establish URLs for such 
interpolation methods. 

Support of the Interpolation Extension does not automatically mean that interpolation param-
eters provided with a request have an effect. Only on operations involving interpolation – 
such as scaling or reprojection – such parameters will affect the result.

OGC® Web Coverage Service Interface Standard - 
Interpolation Extension 

1 Scope 

This OGC WCS Interpolation Extension – in short: Interpolation Extension – defines how a 
client can control interpolation performed by a server during GetCoverage interpolation, 
should an interpolation occur in the course of request evaluation. 

2 Conformance  

This document establishes the following requirements and conformance classes: 

 interpolation, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-extension_ interpo-
lation/1.0/req/interpolation; the corresponding conformance class is interpolation, 
with URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-
extension_interpolation/1.0/conf/interpolation. 

This is the mandatory core conformance class of this extension. 

 interpolation-per-axis, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-
extension_interpolation/1.0/req/interpolation-per-axis; the corresponding conform-
ance class is interpolation-per-axis, with URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-
extension_interpolation/1.0/conf/interpolation-per-axis. 

Standardisation target of all requirements and conformance classes are WCS implementations 
(currently: servers).  

Requirements URIs defined in this document are relative to

6 Interpolation requirements class 

6.1 Overview 

This Clause 6 establishes the Interpolation Extension core conformance class, interpolation. 
Clients and servers supporting this requirements class allow choosing an interpolation meth-
od to be applied whenever interpolation takes place during GetCoverage request evaluation. 
The interpolation method chosen is applied simultaneously along all axes. 

6.2 Modifications to GetCapabilities  

A server announces support of the scaling conformance class to a client by adding the URL 
identifying this extension to the list of supported extensions delivered in the Capabilities 
document. 

Requirement 1 interpolation/interpolation-identifier: 
A WCS service implementing conformance class interpolation of this Interpolation Exten-
sion shall include the following URI in the Profile element of the ServiceIdentifi-
cation in a GetCapabilities response: 
 http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-
extension_interpolation/1.0/conf/interpolation 

Requirement 2 interpolation/capabilities: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall adhere to Figure 1, Table 2, and 
the XML schema defined for this Interpolation Extension. 

Figure 1 presents the UML diagram of the extended Capabilities document. Table 2 details 
the components added.

Requirement 3 interpolation/wcsServiceMetadata: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall contain an Interpolation-
Metadata element. 

Example The following list is returned in the Capabilities document of a server supporting nearest-
neighbor, linear, and quadratic interpolation (URLs are fictitious; see OGC-NA for actually standardized 
interpolation URIs): 

<int:InterpolationMetadata> 
    <int:InterpolationSupported>

    <int:InterpolationSupported> 
        http://www.opengis.net/def/interpolation/OGC/1/quadratic 
    </int:InterpolationSupported> 
</int:InterpolationMetadata> 

Requirement 4 interpolation/wcsServiceMetadata-interpolationMethods: 
The interpolationSupported  item(s) delivered in the ServiceMetadata element 
of the response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall consist of a pairwise distinct list 
of URLs. 

Note The above requirement tentatively does not constrain the admitted URLs to those defined in the 
*-interpolation requirements classes of this document. This allows vendors to support further types of in-
terpolation. However, implementations should use the interpolation URLs for those interpolation types this 
standard provides definitions for.

6.4 Modifications to GetCoverage 

6.4.1 Modifications to the GetCoverage request 

The GetCoverage request is extended with a parameter, globalInterpolation, deter-
mining what interpolation technique is to be applied by the server when preparing the 
GetCoverage response; this interpolation is applied uniformly on all axes of the resulting 
coverage. 

Note This will be extended in the requirements class defined in Clause 7; the representation in this 
UML diagram has been prepared for this, explaining why it could be simplified theoretically. Further, the 
pertaining XML Schema of this Interpolation Extension contains all variants. 

Requirement 5 interpolation/GetCoverage-request: 
A GetCoverage request shall adhere to Figure 2, Table 3, and the XML schema defined for 
this Interpolation Extension.

In a GetCoverage request using the SOAP protocol, an Int::globalInterpolation 
parameter shall be represented by a GML int:globalInterpolation element. 

Example See previous subclause. 

7 Interpolation-per-axis requirements class 

7.1 Overview 

This Clause 7 establishes the optional Interpolation Extension conformance class, interpola-
tion-per-axis. This conformance class specifies how to request and obtain coverages where 
individual interpolation modes can be applied independently to each axis of the coverage 
under processing. For those axes where no interpolation is specified in the interpolation-per-
axis structures, the default interpolation method passed in the core parameter, Int::glo-
balInterpolation, applies. 

7.2 Modifications to GetCapabilities 

Requirement 10 interpolation-per-axis/identifier: 
A WCS service implementing conformance class interpolation-per-axis of this Interpolation 
Extension shall include the following URI in the Profile element of the ServiceI-
dentification in a GetCapabilities response: 
 http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-
extension_interpolation/1.0/conf/interpolation-per-axis 

7.3 Modifications to DescribeCoverage 

None. 

7.4 Modifications to GetCoverage  

7.4.1 Modifications to the GetCoverage request 

Requirement 11 interpolation-per-axis/getCoverage-request: 
The Int::InterpolationPerAxis parameter in a GetCoverage request, if present, 
shall have a structure as defined in Figure 3 and Table 6. 
Dependency:

Requirement 13 interpolation-per-axis/getCoverage-axes-pairwise-distinct: 
In a GetCoverage request containing Int::InterpolationPerAxis parameters, all ax-
is values shall be pairwise distinct. 

Requirement 14 interpolation-per-axis/getCoverage-existing-axis: 
The axis value of each Int::InterpolationPerAxis parameter in a GetCoverage 
request shall be identical to the axisAbbrev element of some CRS axis of the CRS identi-
fied by the srsName attribute in the gml:Envelope element of the coverage generated. 

Note Interpolation always is done towards a target structure (such as an output grid). In presence of 
an OUTPUTCRS parameter according to the WCS CRS Extension [OGC 11-053], therefore, interpolation 
has to be expressed on the axes of the CRS indicated in OUTPUTCRS. Otherwise, the coverage’s Native 
CRS is used.  

7.4.2 Modifications to the GetCoverage response 

Requirement 15 interpolation-per-axis/getCoverage-response: 
The contents of the response to a successful GetCoverage request containing n>0 
Int::InterpolationPerAxis parameters consisting of a1,…,an axis identifiers and 
m1,…,mn interpolation methods shall be obtained by applying interpolation method mi on 
axis ai any time interpolation takes place during preparation of the GetCoverage response; 
for those axes not appearing in this list, the method indicated in the 
int:globalInterpolation parameter shall be applied. 

Example The following is a valid GET/KVP request snippet (see Subclause 7.6) specifying that in gen-
eral (such as lat, long, height, or whatever axis is present in the coverage) linear interpolation is to be ap-
plied, only along the time axis nearest-neighbor is requested (assuming the coverage addressed contains 
such a temporal axis): 

…& INTERPOLATION= 
   http://www.opengis.net/def/interpolation/OGC/1/linear 
 & INTERPOLATIONPERAXIS=phenomenon-time, 
   http://www.opengis.net/def/interpolation/OGC/1/nearest-neighbor 
 &…
