OGC® OWS-7 Aviation – WXXM Assessment Engineering 

Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

In OWS-7, the Aviation Thread focused on investigating and demonstrating the 

applicability of AIXM and WXXM along with relevant OGC specifications and web 

services to applications and tools that support Airline Operations Centers and Flight 

Dispatch applications. Such applications provide information for representing a Common 

Operating Picture; supporting flight planning (including General Aviation) and 

preparation (MET and AIM); calculating weight and balance; estimating fuel 

requirements; in-flight emergency response; etc. 

The document describes the results of using OGC Web Services for accessing and using 

WXXM data, notably within aviation scenarios involving rerouting procedures motivated 

by the sudden closure of airspace areas caused by the eruption of a volcano. The focus of 

this document will be to evaluate the ability to encode and serve associated operational 

data with WXXM 1.1.1.  

The document will specifically insist on all the questions raised regarding this topic, 

along the OWS-7 project life cycle, and will provide synthetic suggestions of 

improvement whenever such solutions have been found.

5 WXXM Assessment Overview 

5.1 WXXM overview 

WXXM, the Weather Data Model, is a UML-based structural definition for the exchange 

of weather information, featuring an Aviation-specific layer. It was designed by 

EUROCONTROL, in partnership with NNEW. 

WXXM is not a piece of software, nor does it have any function on its own. It defines a 

common vocabulary for exchanging weather information between organizations, but it 

does not inherently provide any sort of functionality to facilitate that exchange. It is, 

fundamentally, a set of guidelines for how to think about weather data. 

The Weather Data Model is in fact a set of three tiered data models, only one part of 

which is actually called WXXM: Weather Exchange Model. Together, the three models 

provide conceptual, structural, and physical representations of weather data: 

 The Weather Conceptual Model (WXCM) provides a high-level, 
implementation-independent look at how weather data concepts are connected. 

 The Weather Exchange Model (WXXM) provides a more logical and structural 
(if still implementation-independent) perspective of the same data, in more 

complete detail — the interrelationships of every weather data concept are 

spelled out. 

 The Weather Exchange Schema (WXXS) is a machine-generated, XML-
formatted implementation of the Exchange Model — a "physical" code version 

of it. 

As it has become a common usage, "generic" term WXXM will be used in the following 

sections of the present document, regardless of what part of the model is actually referred 

to. 

The different layers of the WXXM model are represented on the figure below:

5.2 WXXM versions 

Version 1.1 of WXXM was officially released on Jan. 12, 2010, shortly before the OWS-

7 kick-off meeting took place. Issues affecting that version led to the release of version 

1.1.1 on Mar. 19, 2010. This initially introduced a bit of confusion for some participants, 

but it can be stated that most of the OWS-7 work dealing with WXXM has been 

produced with reference to version 1.1.1. 

Suggestions for improvements and corrections designed to solve issues, which resulted 

from OWS-7 experience is proposed to the NNEW team – currently responsible for the 

WXXM evolution – for inclusion into the 1.2 version, planned to be released in Fall 

2010.  

The latest version of the WXXM model is accessible both from the EUROCONTROL 

OneSky website and from the UCAR wiki.

5.3 WXXM data in OWS-7 

WXXM has been used in OWS-7 to encode the following data types: 

 Volcanic ash advisory and SIGMET, and – marginally – a few turbulence and 
icing SIGMET samples (MeteoFrance) 

 TAF, METAR and PIREP (NNEW) 

https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/NNEWD/Downloads


OGC 10-132

 Peak point, sink point and thermal couplet features (GMU) 

These correspond to diverse uses (and challenges) and the experience gained would at 

least partially be valid for other WXXM usages, but it should be kept in mind that the 

overall OWS-7 WXXM experimentation and validation attempt nevertheless remain 

limited in their scope.

6.1 OWS-7 WXXM Components 

6.1.1 Overview 

The three tier OWS-7 architecture (see. e.g. OGC 10-079) encompasses components 

which are either partially or completely devoted to the management of WXXM aspects, 

as depicted on Figure 2 below:

Details on these components can be found in OGC 10-079 and, as far as the Snowflake 

WFS is concerned, in OGC 10-131. 

6.1.2 Interrelationship

Figure 3: Main Data Flows amongst WXXM Components 

The following conventions have been adopted in the graph above: 

 Plain lines represent the most classical interaction schema amongst the 
components whereas dashed ones stand for less conventional ones: either 

introducing a new use of functionality (registry) or as they involve a direct 

relationship between the Client and Access Tiers; 

 Thick black lines correspond to requests, and thin green lines to the associated 
responses, which consist in XML encapsulated in HTTP responses, except for the 

arrow from the FPS toward the Client, which is also an HTTP response, 

nominally containing the requested map, hence under the requested format (e.g. 

JPEG, GIF...); 

 Requests following specific OGC standards are depicted as curved lines (strait 
lines stand for "common" HTTP requests and responses)

6.2 Encoding WXXM Data 

6.2.1 Convergence and Consistency with other Schemas 

6.2.1.1 Measures and Units 

Measures, Units and WX_Measures packages are modeled in such a way that some 

schema validation (like mininclusive and maxinclusive) or allowed units per phenomenon 

can be strictly enforced. It has been questioned whether that capability was at the origin 

of these packages creation. Also, this approach ties a set of phenomena to a defined set of 

uoms, and this differs from an approach like the one chosen by SWE Common – 

especially the Quantity type – or at least gml:Measure, which could be more efficient: 

phenomenon and uom are distinct properties there. Actually, the selected approach has 

been chosen to loosely mirror what is done in AIXM. 

As far as standardization is concerned, opening up uom definitions to be closer to GML 

(i.e. UCUM) would be preferable, but this change remains to be studied, discussed and 

agreed amongst the AIXM and WXXM developers. 

6.2.1.2 Use of Codelists instead of Enums 

The use of codelists instead of enums has been advocated under "best practices" 

considerations for all Aviation thread schemas. WXXM developers did not see a priori 

obstacles to this evolution. 

6.2.1.3 wx:Procedure Element 

It has been noted that the introduction of a wx:procedure is not mandatory. The 

om:procedure/om:Process could indeed by used, adding there the 

wx:ObservationOrForecastProcess (as om:Process is of any type).  

6.2.1.4 DiscreteCoverage 

The GML encoding of DiscreteCoverage is defined in OGC 06-188r1, but a different 

DiscreteCoverage is defined by the WXXM model. It was initially thought that the GML 

definition had a "selective" support of either a spatial domain or a temporal domain, 

which does not suit aviation domain needs (where e.g. trajectories can cover both space 

and time) and would therefore justify the creation of a WXXM-specific discrete coverage 

representation that could support that. The WXXM team even planned to submit a 

Change Request for GML 3.3 precisely to overcome this identified shortcoming.  

The support of both spatial and temporal domain might actually be possible with the 

GML DiscreteCoverage. But since the situation of coverage related developments within 

OGC did not seem crystal clear to OWS-7 participants (e.g. would coverage aspects be 

kept within GML or defined by WCS?), and since the schedules did not seem to be 

compatible anyway, it was thought that keeping the specific definition in WXXM was the 

soundest solution at least for short to mid-term perspectives. 



OGC 10-132

6.2.1.5 WXXM – AIXM link 

It was noted that some characteristics are common to the two domains (e.g. runways 

description, at least as far as their designation and direction are concerned) and defined – 

sometimes differently – by the two models. Consistency considerations naturally lead to 

wonder whether WXXM should be made dependent on AIXM (or even whether the two 

models should be merged). This interrelationship question has been raised in quite a few 

other environments than OWS-7 and has far reaching consequences. 

In broad terms, the overall conclusion reached on this matter is to keep the models 

separate while favoring the collaboration amongst their developers and ensuring that each 

model can benefit from experience gained with the other. All in all, the potential 

duplication of definitions between the two models can be seen as marginal. 

6.2.2 Time Properties 

This section about the various time properties usage could as well have been placed 

within the previous one (6.2.1 Convergence and Consistency with other Schemas) as the 

consistency with the O&M (Observation and Measurement) model indeed plays a central 

role.  

The various phenomena which can be addressed through the WXXM model involve quite 

a few different time characteristics. Not surprisingly, WXXM users – and especially first 

time ones – may end up wondering which is the appropriate WXXM time property to be 

used to encode a given time parameter (which often used to be manipulated routinely 

under other models or formats). 

The associated issue is actually linked to ontology considerations, or, in raw terms, as 

ensuring that the WXXM developers and users indeed agree on time properties names 

and on their respective definitions. In order to concretely illustrate this point, the 

following table lists the time properties of WX:Observation and WX:Forecast elements, 

their intended usage and the issues raised by users (when any):

samplingTime 

Time of forecast Might also be called the forecast target 
time, and to be renamed 
'phenomenonTime' in O&M 2.0. It is the 
time that the estimates apply in the 
world (e.g. if it is a forecast of the 
weather next Tuesday, then 
phenomenonTime='next Tuesday'). 

Q: Should a SIGMET validity period be 
encoded as a 
samplingTime/TimePeriod? 

A: No, rather validTime (see below) 

validTime 

Period when forecast 
is intended to be used 

validTime is generally a time period that 
may include the samplingTime. 

As per O&M 2.0, it is the time when the 
estimates are claimed to be usable. e.g. 
if the forecast was made today but an 
improved one is expected tomorrow, 
the validTime='today (but not 
tomorrow)' 

resultTime 

Time when forecast 
process was run, if 
different from the 
forecastAnalysisTime 

It is the time when the estimate 
became available. 

forecastAnalysisTime 

Analysis time for the 
forecast.  

This is sometimes also referred to as the 
reference time of the forecast. If a 2:00 
PM forecast is generated at 12:00 PM, 
the analysis time is 12:00 PM. Note that 
the analysis time represents the time in 
the same frame of reference as the 
forecast itself. In other words, when 
generating forecasts in non-real time, 
the analysis time will still be consistent 
with the original times produced when 
the forecast was run in real time.

Table 1 – WX:Observation and WX:Forecast Time Properties 

6.2.3 Volcanic Ash SIGMET 

6.2.3.1 Encoding both an Obervation and a Forecast 

The latest WXXM version does not allow encoding both an observation and a forecast in 

a single SIGMET message. This is nevertheless generally required in VA SIGMETs. This 

shortcoming did not enable the full encoding of operational VA SIGMETs. The content 

of WXXM encoded VA SIGMETs had to be restricted to either an observation or a 

forecast. 

6.2.3.2 Phenomenon Type 

SIGMETs address several types of weather phenomena (e.g. icing, thunderstorms, clear 

air turbulence...). It was noted that the phenomenon type is not directly accessible within 

a tag and generally has to be derived e.g. from the presence of given fields. Adding such 

an element would considerably simplify filtering and is therefore recommended for next 

WXXM releases. 

6.2.3.3 CompassDirection 

The enumerated item (Compass16) selected for avwx:VolcanicAshCloud / wx:movement / 

wx:MovementDescription / wx:compassDirection does not correspond to ICAO 

Annex III specification: Compass8 should be used instead. 

This recommendation will have to be considered also in the light of section 6.2.1.2. 

6.2.3.4 Coverage 

Several geographical areas are generally associated to a VA SIGMET: 

 The FIR concerned with the SIGMET; 

 The extension of the single – or often multiple – part(s) of ash cloud(s) which can 
be encountered within that FIR airspace. 

Both kinds of areas are modeled as polygons. Whereas it was thought natural to encode 

ash cloud polygons as SIGMET / airSpaceAreaForecast / Forecast / result / 

volcanicashcloud / extentof, the encoding of the FIR extension was more problematic. 

Two possible parameters had indeed been identified: 

 SIGMET / airSpaceAreaForecast / Forecast / featureOfInterest / avwx:Airspace 

 SIGMET / issuedFor / avwx:Airspace 

This will be brought up with the broader WXXM team to try to trace some of the history 

and intent, and the relationship to O&M and ICAO representations. In the meantime, it 



OGC 10-132

19 

 

was decided (somewhat arbitrarily) to opt for the second one at least for the OWS7 

developments.  

Using the first option had in fact been recommended by some participants, but others 

noticed that it could not be used directly, because the model of avwx:Airspace does not 

have a property (which is required in the O&M model, see e.g. 

https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/AppSchemas/ObservationsAndSampling#Un

known_features). The solution would then be to select om:SamplingFeature as 

featureOfInterest. The sampledFeature inside the sampling feature could then be the 

affected airspace and the SamplingFeature could contain the following reference: 

<sa:sampledFeature xlink:href="urn:ogc:def:nil:OGC:unknown"/>.  Nevertheless, the 

appropriate featureOfInterest should relate to the whole SIGMET (used as a "product"), 

not uniquely to an observation (or forecast) included in that message. 

It had also been contemplated to encode the observation or forecast results as a feature 

collection associated with a boundary box (3 dimensional, or even 4D if the forecast 

horizon was to be encoded simultaneously), thus encompassing all the feature geometries 

in this collection. But the FeatureCollection element is deprecated in GML 3.2, this 

collection would therefore have to be defined directly in the WXXM model. No 

definitive solution has been agreed at the time of report writing. 

Finally, the necessity to systematically include the description of the FIR boundary in all 

SIGMETs was also questioned (mostly for bandwidth optimization considerations, as it 

can generate "heavy" content for characteristics which are mostly of static nature). No 

definitive work around mechanism has been designed yet, but a possibility could lie with 

turning the use of a name element mandatory (within airspace) and requesting that it 

contain the FIR's ICAO 4 character designator (using gml:id for that purpose does not 

seem to be an adequate solution). 

6.3 Serving WXXM Data 

6.3.1 VA SIGMET retrieval based on intersection with a 4D trajectory 

As mentioned in section 6.2.3.1 above, the spatial extensions associated to ash cloud 

model within a VA SIGMET can be multiple: 

 The dispersion of a volcano plume potentially generating several clouds; 

 An ash cloud being modeled possibly at different flight level layers; 

 An ash cloud contour being forecast at different time horizons. 

The requirement for an adequate featureOfInterest, also mentioned in that section, is 

essential in the context of the most typical use case, where a user would like to request 

the WFS for "those VA SIGMET(s) whose ash cloud(s) intersect a given 4D flight 

trajectory".

The problem that there is no distinct spatial property in an observation (and thus currently 

also in a forecast) is known and there is work ongoing to define an O&M extension to 

add this as an observation parameter (which web services may or may not support). The 

problem is due to the O&M concept where there needs to be some knowledge about the 

structure of the feature of interest for which an observation was made. One solution 

might be to add a property to the avwx:AreaReport, which could be the union of the 

spatial extent of all the ash cloud layouts within the concerned FIR. Whether or not this 

would make up the perfect solution isn't clear at the time of document writing (e.g. would 

it allow handling appropriately the temporal dimension as well?). 

In order to handle the case of multiple clouds to be modeled in a given FL range, the 

wx:ExtentOf element definition might usefully be upgraded to include gml:MultiSurface 

as an additional possibility. 

6.3.2 "AnyType" Issue 

Snowflake's GO Loader® provides the functionality to automatically configure the 

schema translations required to translate the data into the database schema. However, the 

WXXM schema does not substitute the anyType data type for om:result property for a 

specified data type (e.g. the different WXXM features). This means GO Loader® cannot 

automatically define the database schema for these properties and discards the property. 

Manual intervention was needed to configure the load and schema generation of this 

property. 

It is recommended that for future releases of WXXM, that feature types extended from 

observation feature types should extend form specialized observation feature types 

classified by their result type as recommended in O&M (ISO/DIS 19156 Geographic 

information – Observations and Measurements). This will enable generic tools such as 

GO Loader® to parse and load the result properties. 

Within the test bed, seemingly valid WXXM data was created where the only geometry 

properties populated were within the om:result anytype property. This data structure 

would be very difficult for generic WXXM clients to predict and query upon, as the 

anyType could contain anything. 

6.4 Portraying WXXM Data 

6.4.1 Compliancy and interoperability issues 

6.4.1.1 Feature collection definition 

The definition of the wx:FeatureCollectionType in the XML Schema of WXXM 1.1.1 is 

not compliant with the OGC GML 3.2 specification. According to this specification, a 

feature collection should be defined as follows (OGC 07-036, paragraph 9.9.1): 



OGC 10-132

 ―A GML feature collection is any GML feature with a property element in its content 

model whose content model is derived by extension from 

gml:AbstractFeatureMemberType (see 9.9.2).‖ 

An example illustrating this principle: 

 <complexType name="MyFeaturesType"> 

<complexContent> 

<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType"> 

<sequence> 

<element name="myMember" 

type="ex:MyFeaturesMemberType" 

minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> 

</sequence> 

<attributeGroup ref="gml:AggregationAttributeGroup"/> 

</extension> 

</complexContent> 

</complexType> 

 

<complexType name="MyFeaturesMemberType"> 

<complexContent> 

<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureMemberType"> 

<sequence minOccurs="0"> 

<element ref="gml:AbstractFeature"/> 

</sequence> 

<attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/> 

</extension> 

</complexContent> 

</complexType> 

 

Applications should be able to rely on this pattern to recognize feature collections in 

custom application schemas. In the WXXM 1.1.1 schema however, the 

FeatureCollectionType is defined as follows: 

 <complexType name="FeatureCollectionType"> 

<complexContent> 

<extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType"> 

<sequence> 

<element maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0" 

name="featureMember" 

type="gml:FeaturePropertyType"/> 

</sequence> 

</extension> 



OGC 10-132 

22 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium  
 

</complexContent> 

</complexType> 

 

As the predefined pattern is not implemented, it is no longer possible to automatically 

detect that the wx:FeatureCollectionType is a GML feature collection, which is key 

information in order to know how to process the data correctly. 

This problem has been noted by the WXXM developers' team, and will be fixed in the 

next version. 

6.4.1.2 Interpretation of observation result 

WXXM 1.1.1 is based upon the OGC Observations & Measurements specification 

(O&M). The XML Schema associated with this specification defines an object type 

(ObservationType) to model observations, which in turn has a property ‗result‘ to model 

the observation results. This ‗result‘ property is of the XML Schema type ‗anyType‘, 

meaning that it can contain anything (see also section 6.3.2 above). The documentation in 

the O&M schema explicitly mentions that custom application schemas may choose to 

constraint the type of the result.  

In the WXXM schema, the result type is not constrained, resulting in a variety of contents 

in the result encoding when working with different data providers. This makes it very 

difficult for applications to detect the type of the observation result when decoding 

WXXM data. To increase interoperability when working with different data vendors, it 

should be considered to either constrain the result type, or to clearly specify how the 

value of the observedProperty element maps to a specific XML Schema type for the 

result. 

6.4.2 Generic Portraying Issues 

The following considerations are derived from the experience gained during the 

implementation of an FPS solely based on the use of OGC standards. They are not 

WXXM specific, and, as far as the second sub-section is concerned, not even FPS 

specific... 

6.4.2.1 Decoupling WFS GetFeature and Styling Parametrization 

The solution selected to store WFS GetFeature parameters (notably the filtering ones) 

within the sld:LayerFeatureConstraints element, which seems to be the common practice 

amongst the OWS-7 participants, This is not consistent with OGC 09-015 (OWS6 ER 

about SLD changes), which proposed to remove that element, considering that it was 

redundant with the Rule filtering capabilities. 

Using the sld:UserStyle / se:FeatureTypeStyle / se:Rule element to store WFS GetFeature 

request parameters, as suggested by OGC 09-015, will no longer permit to fully decouple 



OGC 10-132

23 

 

the styling profile from the data retrieval one. As an example of the usefulness of this 

decoupling capability, one could consider the situation where a client wishes: 

 To implement a spatial filter for the selection of features lying in the vicinity of a 
given flight plan. This filter will be included in the GetFeature request transmitted 

to the WFS); 

 To define various styling options depending on the actual airspace properties (e.g. 
property filters which filter on airspace classification to address specific style 

requirements). These will be implemented in the sld:UserStyle / 

se:FeatureTypeStyle / se:Rule element, used by the FPS to style the data retrieved 

from the WFS. 

6.4.2.2 Schemas "Anachronism" 

In Alticode's FPS implementation, namespaces checks are strictly enforced. This was 

initially thought to be a sound practice, but ended up causing many problems when 

attempting to interconnect with clients and servers using different versions of services 

specifications. 

The main difficulty encountered was caused by clients' use of schemas versions which 

were posterior to those specified in the services implemented (WMS, SLD, SE, FE). 

Local work-around solutions, consisting in allowing alternate namespaces, were 

implemented. However, these are not considered to be satisfactory, mostly because 

assumptions made on the structure of elements, consistent with the version specified in 

the implemented standards, might no longer be valid for later versions of the schemas.

6.5.2 Ideas for Future Work 

As mentioned in section 5.3 above, OWS-7 could only address a small subset of what 

WXXM potentially offers. Even though some of the results obtained can clearly be 

generalized, the limited scope of validation which could be carried out during OWS-7 

should always be kept in mind when interpreting the conclusions. 

OWS-7 participants expressed an unambiguous interest in going on with the process of 

testing WXXM utilization with operational data.
