This element follows the standard GML property model, so the value may be provided directly or by reference. Note that if the value is provided by reference, this definition does not carry a handle (gml:id) in this context, so does not allow external references to this specific entry in this context. When used in this way the referenced definition will usually be in a dictionary in the same XML document.

			 The "_Geometry" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all geometry elements of GML 3. This includes pre-defined and user-defined geometry elements. Any geometry element must be a direct or indirect extension/restriction of AbstractGeometryType and must be directly or indirectly in the substitution group of "_Geometry".
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 All geometry elements are derived directly or indirectly from this abstract supertype. A geometry element may have an identifying attribute ("gml:id"), a name (attribute "name") and a description (attribute "description"). It may be associated with a spatial reference system (attribute "srsName"). The following rules shall be adhered: - Every geometry type shall derive from this abstract type. - Every geometry element (i.e. an element of a geometry type) shall be directly or indirectly in the substitution group of _Geometry.
		
		 
			 
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Optional reference to the CRS used by this geometry.
		
		 
			 
				 In general this reference points to a CRS instance of gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to.
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 This is the abstract root type of the geometric primitives. A geometric primitive is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. All primitives are oriented in the direction implied by the sequence of their coordinate tuples.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 DirectPosition instances hold the coordinates for a position within some coordinate reference system (CRS). Since DirectPositions, as data types, will often be included in larger objects (such as geometry elements) that have references to CRS, the "srsName" attribute will in general be missing, if this particular DirectPosition is included in a larger element with such a reference to a CRS. In this case, the CRS is implicitly assumed to take on the value of the containing object's CRS.
		
		 
			 
				 
			
		
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 DirectPositionList instances hold the coordinates for a sequence of direct positions within the same coordinate reference system (CRS).
		
		 
			 
				 
			
		
	
	
	
	
	 
	
	 
		 
			 Envelope defines an extent using a pair of positions defining opposite corners in arbitrary dimensions. The first direct position is the "lower corner" (a coordinate position consisting of all the minimal ordinates for each dimension for all points within the envelope), the second one the "upper corner" (a coordinate position consisting of all the maximal ordinates for each dimension for all points within the envelope).

			 An abstraction of a surface to support the different levels of complexity. A surface is always a continuous region of a plane.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 A Polygon is a special surface that is defined by a single surface patch. The boundary of this patch is coplanar and the polygon uses planar interpolation in its interior. It is backwards compatible with the Polygon of GML 2, GM_Polygon of ISO 19107 is implemented by PolygonPatch.
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 The "_Ring" element is the abstract head of the substituition group for all closed boundaries of a surface patch.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 An abstraction of a ring to support surface boundaries of different complexity.
		
		 
			 
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 A boundary of a surface consists of a number of rings. In the normal 2D case, one of these rings is distinguished as being the exterior boundary. In a general manifold this is not always possible, in which case all boundaries shall be listed as interior boundaries, and the exterior will be empty.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Encapsulates a ring to represent the surface boundary property of a surface.

			 This abstract element is the head of a substitutionGroup hierararchy which may contain either simpleContent or complexContent elements.  It is used to assert the model position of "class" elements declared in other GML schemas.
		
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 Global element which acts as the head of a substitution group that may include any element which is a GML feature, object, geometry or complex value
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 This content model group makes it easier to construct types that derive from AbstractGMLType and its descendents "by restriction".  A reference to the group saves having to enumerate the standard object properties.
		
		 
			 
			 
				 
					 Multiple names may be provided.  These will often be distinguished by being assigned by different authorities, as indicated by the value of the codeSpace attribute.  In an instance document there will usually only be one name per authority.
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 All complexContent GML elements are directly or indirectly derived from this abstract supertype to establish a hierarchy of GML types that may be distinguished from other XML types by their ancestry. Elements in this hierarchy may have an ID and are thus referenceable.
		
		 
			 
		
		 
	
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 A pattern or base for derived types used to specify complex types corresponding to a UML aggregation association.  An instance of this type serves as a pointer to a remote Object.
		
		 
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 Database handle for the object.  It is of XML type ID, so is constrained to be unique in the XML document within which it occurs.  An external identifier for the object in the form of a URI may be constructed using standard XML and XPointer methods.  This is done by concatenating the URI for the document, a fragment separator, and the value of the id attribute.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Attribute group used to enable property elements to refer to their value remotely. It contains the simple link components from xlinks.xsd, with all members optional, and the remoteSchema attribute, which is also optional.  These attributes can be attached to any element, thus allowing it to act as a pointer. The 'remoteSchema' attribute allows an element  that carries link attributes to indicate that the element is declared  in a remote schema rather than by the schema that constrains the current document instance.
		
		 
	
	
	 
		 
			 Label for the object, normally a descriptive name. An object may have several names, typically assigned by different authorities.  The authority for a name is indicated by the value of its (optional) codeSpace attribute.  The name may or may not be unique, as determined by the rules of the organization responsible for the codeSpace.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Contains a simple text description of the object.
			 Restricted to only allow a text string, as done in GML 3.2.

Foreword


This document specifies a subset profile of the existing OGC Implementation Specification for the Geometry Markup Language (GML) version 3.1.1 [OGC 03-105r1 and 04-093r4], and does not modify it. This is a GML profile as specified in Subclause 22 of [OGC 03-105r1]. This document does not replace any existing OGC document.

This document includes one normative annex: Annex A.


Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The OGC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.


Introduction


This document specifies a GML profile for supporting multiple profiles for XML encoding definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations. This XML schema is a profile of the OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.1.1. This profile supports almost all the XML elements, attributes, and types used by CRS-related GML object elements.


GML 3.1.1 CRS support profile

1 Scope


This GML 3.1.1 profile is defined for supporting multiple other possible profiles for XML encoding definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations. This profile supports the following XML elements, attributes, and types:


a) Definition element


b) Envelope element


c) PolygonType complexType

d) LengthType, AngleType, GridLengthType, ScaleType, TimeType, and SpeedType complexTypes

e) unitOfMeasure element 

f) simpleLink attributeGroup

g) _CRS abstract element

h) IdentifierType complexType

i) Dictionary element

This profile does not support encoding of most other concrete elements defined in GML 3.1.1.

All CRS and CRS-related definitions encoded using this profile shall produce XML documents that are fully compliant with the normative XML Schema Documents associated with this specification, named: 


a) gmlCrsSupportProfile.xsd


b) basicTypes.xsd


c) dictionary.xsd


d) geometryBasic0d1d.xsd


e) geometryBasic2d.xsd


f) gmlBase.xsd


g) measures.xsd


h) units.xsd


i) referenceSystems.xsd


j) xlinks.xsd


Except for gmlCrsSupportProfile.xsd, all these XML Schema Documents contain the subset of the corresponding GML 3.1.1 document that is needed by this GML 3.1.1 CRS Support profile. This was done to facilitate checking that this profile is a strict subset of GML 3.1.1. This also facilitates comparing each document with the original, to determine which elements, attributes, and types were retained, and which were removed.


XML documents compliant with this profile shall (indirectly) import the gmlCrsSupportProfile.xsd XML Schema Document, which will be available following approval of this document at http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/Profiles/CrsSupport/1.0.0/.


More specifically, compliance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative).

6 CRS support profile

Background


GML 3.1.1 includes six XML Schema Documents for encoding definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations, namely: (listed alphabetically)


a) coordinateOperations.xsd


b) coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd


c) coordinateSystems.xsd


d) dataQuality.xsd


e) datums.xsd


f) referenceSystems.xsd


However, this set of XML Schema Documents supports many abilities that are rarely used. Therefore, multiple CRS-related profiles of this part of GML 3.1.1 are expected to be useful and specified, where each profile is significantly simpler and thus easier to understand and use.


This set of CRS-related XML Schema Documents does not use all the other 23 GML 3.1.1 XML Schema Documents, and does not use all the abilities specified in the documents it does use. Furthermore, even fewer abilities will be used by the expected profiles of that set of six XML Schema Documents which remove rarely-used abilities. Therefore, a profile of the other 23 GML 3.1.1 XML Schema Documents will be useful to support profiles of the XML Schema Documents for XML encoding of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations.


This profile was produced by retaining only those parts of the other 23 GML 3.1.1 XML Schema Documents which are used (directly and indirectly) by the six XML Schema Documents for XML encoding of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations. Other parts used by CRS-related parts which are rarely used were also removed. In addition, the referenceSystems.xsd XML Schema Document was modified by removing rarely used parts, and was included in this CRS Support profile because it is expected to be needed by all other CRS-related profiles.

Overview


This GML 3.1.1 profile is defined for supporting multiple other profiles for encoding definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations. This GML 3.1.1 CRS Support profile retains the following XML elements, attributes, and types used by CRS-related elements:


a) Definition in dictionary.xsd, which is the head of a substitution group containing all CRS-related XML object elements

b) Envelope in geometryBasic0d1d.xsd, which is used in the validArea element for several CRS-related XML objects


c) PolygonType in geometryBasic2d.xsd, which is used in the validArea element for several CRS-related XML objects


d) LengthType, AngleType, GridLengthType, ScaleType, TimeType, and SpeedType in measures.xsd, which are expected to be used in parameterValue elements (in coordinateOperations.xsd). The LengthType and AngleType are now used in GeodeticDatum elements (in datums.xsd).

e) unitOfMeasure in units.xsd, which is used in covarianceMatrix elements (in dataQuality.xsd)

f) simpleLink in xlinks.xsd, which is frequently used CRS-related XML property elements

g) _CRS in referenceSystems.xsd, which is used by concrete CRS object elements 

h) IdentifierType in referenceSystems.xsd, which is used by concrete CRS object elements

i) Dictionary in dictionary.xsd, which is used in XML encoded dictionaries of CRS-related XML objects


In addition to the above listed XML elements, attributes, and types, the types, elements, and attributes needed to support those were also retained. Essentially all other parts were removed, including all deprecated parts.

This GML 3.1.1 CRS Support profile removes optional and alternative contents elements and attributes from the above-listed XML elements and types, when these options and alternatives are rarely used for defining Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate Operations. In addition to removing all deprecated parts, the removed contents elements and attributes include:


a) metaDataProperty, from StandardObjectProperties in gmlBase.xsd


b) remoteSchema, from AssociationAttributeGroup in gmlBase.xsd


c) AssociationAttributeGroup alternative, from “description” in gmlBase.xsd


d) srsDimension and SRSInformationGroup, from SRSReferenceGroup in geometryBasic0d1d.xsd


e) “count”, from DirectPositionListType in geometryBasic0d1d.xsd


f) “interior”, from PolygonType in geometryBasic2d.xsd


g) all alternatives to LinearRing in _Ring substitutionGroup in geometryBasic2d.xsd


h) temporalExtent, from ExtentType in referenceSystems.xsd

i) indirectEntry, from Dictionary in dictionary.xsd


j) AssociationAttributeGroup, from DictionaryEntryType in dictionary.xsd


7 XML schema documents


This GML 3.1.1 CRS Support profile is specified in the 10 normative XML Schema Documents included in the zip file with this text document, which are named:


a) gmlCrsSupportProfile.xsd


b) basicTypes.xsd


c) dictionary.xsd


d) geometryBasic0d1d.xsd


e) geometryBasic2d.xsd


f) gmlBase.xsd


g) measures.xsd


h) units.xsd


i) referenceSystems.xsd


j) xlinks.xsd (version 1.0.1)


NOTE 
Although referenceSystems.xsd is a CRS-related schema document, parts of it are required in all other CRS-related GML profiles, so it is included in this CRS Support profile.


All these XML Schema Documents contain documentation of the meaning of each element and attribute, and this documentation shall be considered normative as specified in Subclause 11.6.3 of [OGC 05-008].


After OGC acceptance of Version 1.0.0 of this specification, all but one of these XML Schema Documents will also be posted online at the URL http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/Profiles/GCrsSupport/1.0.0. The xlinks.xsd document will be posted at the URL: http://schemas.opengis.net/xlink/1.0.1/xlinks.xsd. In the event of a discrepancy between the bundled and online versions of the XML Schema Documents, the online files shall be considered authoritative.

Foreword 


This document specifies a subset profile of the existing OGC Implementation 
Specification for the Geometry Markup Language (GML) version 3.1.1 [OGC 03-105r1 
and 04-093r4], and does not modify it. This is a GML profile as specified in Subclause 22 
of [OGC 03-105r1]. This document does not replace any existing OGC document. 


This document includes one normative annex: Annex A. 


Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The OGC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or 
all such patent rights. 


Introduction 


This document specifies a GML profile for supporting multiple profiles for XML 
encoding definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate 
Operations. This XML schema is a profile of the OGC Geography Markup Language 
(GML) version 3.1.1. This profile supports almost all the XML elements, attributes, and 
types used by CRS-related GML object elements.

GML 3.1.1 CRS support profile 


1 Scope 
This GML 3.1.1 profile is defined for supporting multiple other possible profiles for 
XML encoding definitions of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) and Coordinate 
Operations. This profile supports the following XML elements, attributes, and types: 


a) Definition element 
b) Envelope element 
c) PolygonType complexType 
d) LengthType, AngleType, GridLengthType, ScaleType, TimeType, and SpeedType 


complexTypes 


e) unitOfMeasure element  
f) simpleLink attributeGroup 
g) _CRS abstract element 
h) IdentifierType complexType 
i) Dictionary element 


This profile does not support encoding of most other concrete elements defined in GML 
3.1.1. 


2 Compliance 
All CRS and CRS-related definitions encoded using this profile shall produce XML 
documents that are fully compliant with the normative XML Schema Documents 
associated with this specification, named:  


a) gmlCrsSupportProfile.xsd 
b) basicTypes.xsd 
c) dictionary.xsd 
d) geometryBasic0d1d.xsd 
e) geometryBasic2d.xsd 
f) gmlBase.xsd 
g) measures.xsd

Except for gmlCrsSupportProfile.xsd, all these XML Schema Documents contain the 
subset of the corresponding GML 3.1.1 document that is needed by this GML 3.1.1 CRS 
Support profile. This was done to facilitate checking that this profile is a strict subset of 
GML 3.1.1. This also facilitates comparing each document with the original, to determine 
which elements, attributes, and types were retained, and which were removed. 


XML documents compliant with this profile shall (indirectly) import the
