Abstract 

The USGS Interoperability assessment was conducted under the OGC Interoperability 
Program with the goal to better understand how USGS customers make use of OGC 
compliant Web services operated by USGS. For this assessment, USGS customers have 
been invited to share their experiences and to describe their use cases and experiences 
made with USGS data services and products. From those descriptions, recommendations 
have been derived that help USGS to better understand their user community and 
optimize their service offerings.

USGS OGC® Interoperability Assessment Report  

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

The USGS Interoperability assessment was conducted under the OGC Interoperability 
Program. The goal of this assessment is to better understand how USGS customers make 
use of OGC Web services operated by USGS. Currently, USGS data services get over 1 
million hits per day. USGS data are being used by a range of communities at the state, 
county, city, and other levels for a variety of purposes, such as science and decision-
support. The assessment was conducted under the auspices of the National Geospatial 
Program (NGP). The vision of the NGP is to "satisfy the needs of users by providing 
geospatial products and services that users incorporate into their decision-making and 
operational activities." To support that vision, the User Engagement (UE) team acts as the 
NGP technical outreach group and performs the following activities:  

 Systematically gathers, analyzes and reports user requirements for “The National 
Map” (TNM) products and services from high priority communities of use  

 Helps users exploit TNM products and services to meet their core mission 
requirements  

 Develops and maintains relationships with users and sources of authoritative data 
sources  

 Communicates NGP program activities and directions to the broad audience of 
government, commercial, academic and public professionals. 

OGC helped the USGS assess whether OGC standards as implemented in USGS servers 
are meeting users requirements. The following main tasks were performed in this project: 

 Compliance Testing: USGS provided 15 OGC standards based servers that were 
tested thoroughly for compliance. OGC enabled services tested included: OGC 
Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Sensor 
Observation Service (SOS) 

 Development of use cases and investigation of usability with Communities of use: 
Communities using USGS data were invited to participate in a virtual exercise 



OGC 14-079r1

(Webinar). In the exercise the Webinar was used to capture the use cases, tools 
and overall experience of communities interacting with USGS data.  

 Developing executable test suites for OGC Catalogue (CAT) 3.0: At the time of 
this project the Catalog/CSW 3.0 standard was in process of approval. The test 
was developed for the basic conformance classes.

1.3 Future work 

Future work is envisioned in the context of service testing. This project informed the 
OGC process, resulting in modifications to the initial CITE TEAM Engine test scripts for 
WFS (version 1.1). To make those tests fully independent of the data set supported by the 
service, further modifications are necessary.

4 Summary 

USGS data services are an important resource for different communities, including 
organizations at the state, county, and city level. The data are used for variety of 
purposes, such as scientific research, planning, and decision-support. OGC assisted the 
USGS by running an interoperability assessment initiative with the goal of determining 
whether OGC standards as implemented in USGS servers were meeting users 
requirements. Three activities were part of this project: 

 Compliance Testing: A total number of 15 Web services were tested using the 
CITE TEAM engine as well as additional manual tests. The goal was to evaluate 
the compliance of WFS, WCS, and SOS service instances. The current 
compliance test suite requires some of these services (WFS 1.0 and WFS 1.1) to 
serve a specific test data set. As it was not possible to load this test data set on the 
production level service instances, the compliance tests were adapted to work 
with generic services. The type and nature of the tests have been conserved. The 
modified tests and test results are described in chapter five. Future work is 
envisioned to make the changes official.  

 Developing executable test suites for CAT 3.0: At the time of this project the 
OGC Catalog/CSW 3.0 candidate standard was in the approval process. A test 
was developed for the basic conformance class and published in GitHub. This test 
should serve as a baseline that can be advanced by other test developers. More 
details can be found in chapter six.  

 Development of use cases and investigation of usability with Communities of 
Use: Over the course of three webinars, experiences and use case descriptions 
from six participants were recorded and assessed. This process yielded a broad 
range of use cases. Some organizations used the offered services “as is”. Other 
organizations integrated data and services into their own workflows, developing 
complex processing chains and advertising new data sets based on data processing 
results. 

In summary, all participants documented use cases that heavily depend on reliable 
services. These services are either part of independent web applications or part of 
complex workflows that in turn generate additional related data. In terms of data formats 
and corresponded service types, users require data to be served in multiple formats with 
different service types. As an example, a number of users reported using web-mapping 
services for base layers within their applications, whereas other users required the same 
data to be served in vector or raster formats that can be further processed within some 
GIS technology. The GIS tools used most often include various ESRI ArcGIS1 products

as well as the open source tool QGIS2. A recurring desire was for notification services 
that inform users about service down times or potential changes to service configurations 
and setups. Chapter seven documents the webinars and key findings in more detail.  

The report concludes in Chapter 8 with general recommendations that would help 
improve user experiences with USGS Web services.  

5 Compliance Testing 

5.1 Introduction 

USGS data services receive over 1 million hits per day. To optimize user experiences 
with those services, as part of this project a testing campaign was conducted. The 
campaign followed the principles and applied the technologies of the OGC Compliance 
program (http://cite.opengeospatial.org). The OGC Compliance Program provides the 
resources, procedures, and policies for improving software implementations' compliance 
with OGC standards. The Compliance Program provides an online free testing facility, a 
process for certification and branding of compliant products, and coordination of a 
vibrant community that develops and supports test scripts.  

Tests were conducted in two iterations. During both iterations, 15 OGC enabled Web 
services were tested using the OGC Compliance Program TEAM Engine version 4. The 
TEAM (Test, Evaluation, And Measurement) engine is written in Java and executes 
compliance tests defined in Compliance Test Language3 (CTL). For testing, a local 
installation of the engine was used. Due to resource constraints, the second test series was 
reduced in size. Both iterations were completed with manual tests using the command 
line tool curl4 (http://curl.haxx.se) and a local Java implementation to send HTTP GET 
and HTTP POST requests using Key-Value-Pair and XML encodings. The responses of 
both approaches have been validated using different XML Parsers (Xerces-J, Saxon-EE 
9.5.0.2 and LibXML). 

The tests were applied to different OGC enabled interfaces, such as WFS 1.0 and 1.1.0, 
SOS 1.0, and WCS 1.0 services. The existing WFS 1.1 compliance tests required 
uploading a specific test data set prior to testing. This approach is not practical when 
testing production servers that do not contain test data. Therefore, the test scripts were 
modified to make the tests more generic and therefore independent of the test data. This 
allowed better testing of basic functionality of USGS servers. Due to resource constraints 
all tests could not be modified. To offset these TEAM engine tests, numerous tests have 

                                                

2 http://www.qgis.org/en/site/ 
3 The TEAM engine can execute test scripts written in other languages as well, such as TestNG. In this project, CTL 
was used exclusively.  
4 curl is a command line tool for transferring data with URL. curl supports HTTP POST and HTTP GET amongst 
many other things.

been conducted manually, i.e. outside of TEAM engine. A potential strategy to modify 
the outstanding tests is described at the end of chapter 5. 

5.2 Applied Modifications to Test Scripts 

The WFS 1.1 test scripts are based on the assumption that a dedicated dataset has been 
made available at the service endpoint. If this not the case, most tests produce failure 
reports due to the missing data. To make the tests more generic, all DescribeFeatureType 
tests have been modified. Instead of sending a DescribeFeatureType request with a 
specific typename, the typename gets extracted from the capabilities response document 
and is dynamically loaded into the DescribeFeatureType operation (payload). This new 
behavior has been achieved by adding a GetCapabilities request prior to the 
DescribeFeatureType request. The GetCapabilities response is then parsed, the essential 
information including namespace settings extracted, stored in a temporary variable and 
eventually loaded into the DescribeFeatureType request. The response is again evaluated 
against the typename(s). This extended testing procedure required extensive 
modifications to the test scripts, as all aspects have to be described using XSLT 
commands. Those modifications make the test scripts more verbose and far more difficult 
to read. The new test scripts have been uploaded to GitHub to make them publicly 
available (https://github.com/opengeospatial/).  

The same approach was used for some GetFeature operation tests. Problems arise when 
specific details of a feature are tested, such as its geospatial properties, as those depend 
on the feature itself, which can be of various types.   

A number of tests used XML payloads sent via HTTP POST. Those tests scripts were not 
modified. Instead, custom scripts were developed and executed manually.

In terms of compliance, all tested services possessed minor to major issues. None of the 
services were fully OGC standards-compliant, but most of the services could readily be 
used by client applications. The Compliance issues appear to be combination of service 
implementations that are not fully standards compliant and set up issues that could be 
solved without modifications to the server software. A number of those issues were 
solved during “window” between the two test iterations. The second test iteration 
reported a number of compliant services. The detailed testing results are available in 
Annex B of this document. 

5.4 Remaining Test Scripts Modification Strategy 

WFS 1.1 supports several request encodings sent using different HTTP commands, i.e. 
key-value-pair (KVP) via HTTP GET, and KVP and XML via HTTP POST. The test 
scripts dynamically load externally governed XML files at runtime. The approach 
documented above, where data is temporarily stored in CTL variables and requests are 
dynamically generated and executed, makes it very difficult to adapt those XML files to 
specific service instances. The XML files are simply linked from within the test scripts, 
loaded, added to a request, but not further processed.  

A strategy to allow testing of ad hoc feature types is to allow modification of those XML 
files with feature type specifics. For example, the feature type name ns:foo in the XML 
file is replaced with ns2:bar (as it is de facto supported by this service instance) and the 
response tested against this ns2:bar feature type name. This approach, though more a 
“hack” than proper testing routine, works surprisingly well for a number of tests, in 
particular GetFeature operation tests.  

5.5 Test Suite Recommendations 

Develop a Basic WFS 1.1.0 profile that will test WFS 1.1.0 servers without the need to 
have test data. An issue has been created in the CITE issue tracker: 



OGC 14-079r1 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 9 
 

https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-wfs11/issues/1 

Change test scripts to use another testing language. The CTL language is very hard to 
use. TestNG appears to be easier, but more information is required on the OGC web site 
about how to use TestNG. 

TEAM Engine console reporting requires improvement to better present the failures 
instead of all information, which is hard to parse. Fix is in progress: 

https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine/issues/44 

6 Catalog Service 3.0 Executable Test Suite 

At time of this project, Catalog Service 3.0 had just been released for Public Comment, 
and it was on its way to approval as a two-part standard. 

http://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/2030  

The two parts included a supplemental document with the Abstract Test Suite that would 
allow the preparation of test scripts for OGC testing environments. One of the 
conformance classes articulates a nominal Opensearch environment. There were already 
at least two implementations of CSW 3.0 in existence (by CubeWerx and Conterra) and a 
third in process (pyCSW). This task tackles the development of a baseline set of 
conformance classes. 

The source for the development of the test was as follows:

The baseline of the CAT 3.0 test suite was published in GitHub. Executable Test against 
getCapabilities and getRecordById were developed. Reference implementers planned to 
start interacting with the test September-December 2014.

The Call for Participation (CFP) was issued 1 May 2014. The announcement was made to 
all OGC members and through USGS channels by email. USGS users were invited to 
share their experiences and to describe their use when interacting with USGS data 
services and products. In total, seven responses were received in response CFP issued on 
May 1st (see annex A). The participants were invited to participate in 30 min Webinars, 
where they showed their typical workflows, demonstrated how USGS data products are 
used, and shared their experiences and best practices. The sessions were recorded and are 
available on the OGC portal. This section summarizes the main results and should help 
USGS to better understand their user community and to optimize their data offerings. 
Further, this report includes useful material for GIS client and tool developers, and 
documents typical problems and issues experienced by the customers. The results from 
this assessment were also discussed at a Webinar co-located with the OGC TC meeting in 
September 2014. 

The following responses were received:

7.2 California Earthquake Clearinghouse 

7.2.1 Use Case 

In case of an emergency, a variety of organizations have to respond to observed impacts 
and identified threats with resources that protect people, property, and the environment 
from loss. In order to coordinate the response, task resources and engage the right 
partners (e.g. military), critical information for decision support is required. The first 
response usually takes place at the local level. In case of a major disaster, observations 
are initially reported to the local operation center, which is equivalent to the county level. 
If it escalates, coordination with the regional information center is the next step. From 
there, other operational areas can be called in to provide mutual aid support. Depending 
on the disaster, coordination is further rolled up to the state/federal level. 

 

Figure 3: Local to federal communication and support chains 

The state coordinates requests for resources from the local, regional, state, and federal 
levels through mission tasking; prioritized by life safety, property, and the environment. 
This coordination of an operation requires situational awareness, common operating 
pictures, and forecast models that forecast as yet unobserved impacts. It is important to 
understand what happened where with what impact, who is in charge, which information 
needs to be delivered to whom and how the response looks like in terms of resources 
employed, operating procedures, and tasks performed. The challenge is to capture and 
deliver authoritative information to the right level, where it needs to be managed in an 



OGC 14-079r1

organized way. The information itself is generated at all organizational levels using a 
variety of technologies as well as human observers. In case of an disaster, not only does 
geo-referenced (GIS) data need to be integrated, but lots of other types, such as tables, 
reports, images, field observations, diagrams, or checklists need to be served as well. 
Those types cannot be easily represented in traditional GIS.  

The clearinghouse started in 1971 with five managing partners, the California Geological 
Survey, the US Geological Survey, California Office of Emergency Services, Earthquake 
Engineering Research Institute, California Safety Commission. In case of an emergency, 
the entire range of organizations makes use of the clearinghouse, including organizations 
dealing with utilities, emergency responders, researchers, etc.  

7.2.2 Data & Services 

Data provided by the USGS is key to several partner organizations of the California 
Clearinghouse. The data includes aerial photography, various remote sensing data, 
LIDAR, several national map products, sensor networks (e.g. provided by the 
Department of Water Resources) or earthquake sensing devices, the Geospatial Multi-
Agency Coordination platform (GeoMAC), National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), Fire 
and Hazard REST services from the Natural Hazard Support System (NHSS), Hazards 
Data Distribution System (HDDS) Explorer. The following figure represents the 
technology decisions taken by the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services.

CalEOS has adaptors to a number of technologies, e.g. WebEOS, ArcGIS online, Unified 
Incident Command and Decision Support (UICDS), and a number of other technologies 
used in the field or by other organizations. The UICDS middleware plays a central role 
for data communication. A key challenge in the past has been to communicate and to 
work collaboratively on geospatial information with other agencies and organizations in 
the geospatial world, given that there are roughly 150-200 different interfaces (geospatial 
and non-geospatial) that exit in common emergency management tools and related 
services. UICDS represents data in a number of standard formats that come from the 
geospatial community, the emergency management community, or the military. Formats 
include OGC formats such as KML, GML, and O&M; or NIEM (which uses GML for 
encoding location/geographic elements). Arriving data is converted into the best fitting 
standard for a particular use. This approach allows the use a single platform for 
representing geospatial information: ArcGIS online. Putting all geospatial information on 
ArcGIS online has solved the problem of the high number of different interfaces and 
formats to a large extent, as long as the necessary software licenses can be afforded by all 
participating organizations. 

The various text-based or report-based incident information systems used in the past have 
been superseded by a customized version of WebEOC, an incident management system 
developed by Intermedix Corp. Though WebEOC has a viewer component, it is not really 
a GIS tool. Therefore, geospatial information received from the various levels (local to 
regional to state and federal level) gets ported to ArcGIS online for efficient collaboration 
with external partners. This approach ensures that data is aggregated as necessary and 
consistently communicated across all organizations involved in the disaster management 
operation. Being synchronized at the state level, it is ensured that all organizations can 
view the same data, even though with their specific client applications that uses adapted 
representations.  

The key role of UICDS is further illustrated in the figure 5. This figure illustrates the 
coordination, communication and data orchestration, between a number of organizations 
in an earthquake event, where there is limited time for data discovery. Incoming data 
needs to be analyzed and combined with other existing data, new data is produced as a 
result, and new maps are dynamically created with multiple layers. All these data become 
part of the Common Operational Data (COD), which is exchanged between systems 
using various UICDS middleware implementations, operated by organizations on various 
administrative levels. Therefore, the efficient integration of any data set into the UICDS 
middleware layer is critical.  

The connection between the UICDS, WebEOC, and ArcGIS online allows the definition 
of new layers based on existing information, and enables this data to be pushed back and 
forth between the various systems. As an example, a layer based on a feature selection 
within ArcGIS online can be pushed into UICDS as a Web Map Context Layer. In the 
future, using OWS Context instead of Web Map Context would provide additional 
functionality.

7.2.3 Recommendations 

The following recommendations have been discussed and derived from the online 
meeting and use case analysis: 

1. Embraced by DHS and DoD, the Unified Incident Command and Decision 
Support (UICDS) middleware is becoming more and more important in the 
domain of disaster management. Thus, by providing a direct connection into 
UICDS middleware from USGS services would overcome huge interoperability 
burdens. USGS data would become part of the Common Operational Data, i.e. 
data following a limited number of information models that are directly supported 
by UICDS. This process could be optimized by establishing a point of contact to 
coordinate between USGS, UICDS and OGC. 

2. USGS should publish data at more than a single OGC enabled interface. Within 
certain communities, it might make sense to complement the data served with 



OGC 14-079r1 

16 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

other types of OGC Web services (e.g. WMS, WFS, SOS and WCS) as well as, 
multiple formats. 

3. All USGS services should be tested for full standard compliancy to the necessary 
detail.  

7.3 Louisiana DOTD 

The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development serves the transportation 
and water resource needs of Louisiana residents, businesses and government partners. 
Here, we discuss experiences from the GIS & emergency operations before, during, and 
after the hurricanes of 2005. 

7.3.1 Use Case 

The use case addressed preparation, analysis, and clean-up operations in the context of 
hurricane Katrina in 2005. Almost a decade has passed since that event, and policies and 
procedures have changed, following the general path towards digitalization and rapid 
information exchange using mobile devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.) instead of 
printing and distributing paper maps. Nevertheless, the principle workflows in terms of 
data discovery, aggregation, analysis, and produced type and content of maps remain the 
same, independent of changing distribution mechanisms.  

One of the first maps produced (which was printed and distributed a million times in 
2005) shows the different evacuation zones. This map requires detailed and up to date 
elevation data to calculate the different zones. Given that high resolution and quality 
elevation data is required in flat coastal zones, services shall be used that provide the 
latest and best data available. Evacuation zone maps are further detailed with evacuation 
routes for the different zones and phases. Evacuation information needs to be conveyed to 
the public well in advance to a potential flooding event. At the time of the event, real 
time information and continuously updated forecast information needs to be taken into 
account, including storm track, flooding, stream and tide gages, state of roads and 
highways, hospitals, people left behind, and others. As the data comes from various 
sources, it would be necessary to aggregate the data and make it available as service to 
clients in particular on mobile devices. Figure 6 illustrates an example, showing gages 
from USGS and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, combined with other information that 
will be served as a service by Louisiana DOTD.

Figure 6: Aggregated data intended to be served as a service by DOTD 

7.3.2 Data & Services 

Louisiana DOTD uses specific services from USGS that are or are intended to be 
complemented with additional data sets, such as further hydrologic data, elevation data, 
weather and storm surge data, road and highway data, etc. The data services used so far 
include  

 WFS: geonames,  

 WFS: govunits,  

 WFS: structures,  

 WFS: transportation,  

 SOS: Aggregate Water Use Data System (AWUDS),  

 WFS: NHDPlus,  

 WFS: National Atlas Congressional Districts of the United States,  



OGC 14-079r1 

18 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 WCS: EDC Land Cover,  

 WCS: National Elevation Dataset, 

 WFS: Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center 

 

Real time data is of major interest, as data is often used to identify specific areas or serves 
as a basis for management operations, e.g. the number and types of pumps to dry out a 
flooded area or current debris removal situation. In order to process data in DOTD’s GIS, 
data, in particular image data, needs to be transformed into vector data for further 
processing. This processing is not necessarily done by DOTD, but by other organizations 
such as FEMA or DHS, that reissue processed image data as services.  

Mobile devices become more and more important in daily operations, as they allow 
conveying real time information from the field to the command centers.  

7.3.3 Recommendations 

ArcGIS Online and other ESRI client products are widely used within DOTD. Therefore, 
it is recommended to ensure that those ESRI products are fully compliant with OGC 
enabled Web services interfaces. This allows ArcGIS Online as well as other ESRI 
products to access USGS Web services as clients; and allows other clients to access the 
data when running in server mode. Only the full support of the various OGC enabled 
interfaces both in client and server mode offers maximum interoperability and user 
experience.  

7.4 US Fish and Wildlife Service 

7.4.1 Use Case 

In this use case, we analyze the work performed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service 
(USFWS), ecological services division, in the context of projects related to endangered 
species and 404 permits, which pertain to discharge of dredged and fill material into US 
waterways. 

The USFWS receives requests to review project proposals that are related to (possibly) 
endangered species conflicts and section 404 permits. “Section 404 of the Clean Water 
Act establishes a program to regulate the discharge of dredge and fill material into 
waters of the United States, including wetlands. Activities in waters of the United States 
that are regulated under this program include fills for development, water resource 
projects (such as dams and levees), infrastructure development (such as highways and 
airports), and conversion of wetlands to uplands for farming and forestry. EPA and the 
Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly administer the program. In addition, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and State resource 
agencies have important advisory roles... USFWS assesses potential adverse effects 



OGC 14-079r1

directly encompassing wetlands and wildlife resources, conducts site visits to assess 
biological functionality and habitat quality, coordinates with local, state, and federal 
agencies, and comments to the Army Corps of Engineers” 
(http://www.fws.gov/charleston/404Permits.html). 

The in-house part of those activities includes intensive GIS-based analysis of species, 
habitants, and environments. To perform this job, USFWS has various data layers 
available with regards to species locations and habitats at a very fine scale. Those data 
layers are complemented by data coming from USGS and other sources. Using QGIS and 
ArcGIS clients, USFWS analyzes a variety of data sets by loading it into the client 
application and by applying typical GIS operations on the various overlaid data sets. 
Therefore, data in vector formats or well-described raster data is preferred over pure 
imagery data.  

Regarding external data, USFWS prefers having direct access to well-maintained data 
offered at Web services interfaces rather than keeping local copies of full data sets that do 
not get maintained. In terms of imagery, accessing external services rather than 
maintaining local repositories frees up lots of memory space in addition. These Web 
services shall implement OGC standards, as those services can easily be integrated into 
the client applications and do not require substantial re-configuration if changes to the 
services are applied. In the past, several vendor-specific services became unavailable 
after the service software was modified. Caching of Web service data is an option, but 
not necessary as long as service availability and accessibility is ensured. 

To exchange views on different data sets, USFWS makes us of Arc mxd-files to share 
layer configurations and data representations with biologists and other organizations. 
This approach works very well if the partnering organization uses QGIS, as appropriate 
plugins exist to handle mxd files. The ESRI software ArcGIS allows exchanging view 
configurations WMS set ups, but WFS is not supported out of the box. ArcGIS requires 
the interoperability extension to be installed. This ESRI issue hinders the integration of 
WFS services.  

7.4.2 Data & Services 

In terms of external data sources, USFWS cooperates with other organizations, such as 
the state. The state operates NC One Map, “a public service providing comprehensive 
discovery and access to North Carolina's geospatial data resources. NC OneMap, the 
State's Clearinghouse for geospatial information, relies on data sharing and partnerships.” 
(http://nconemap.com) The platform features spatial exploration and supports searching 
for specific service types among other criteria. Other external data sets used include: 

 USGS NHD includes very useful layers, though receiving data from a WFS 
interfaces is preferred over the offered WMS, as further data analysis is 
constrained otherwise 



OGC 14-079r1

 USGS Hydro Points (from Geonames) are very useful to identify locations 
referred to using historical names. This is particularly relevant in the context 
of permits issued at times when other names had been in place.  

 USGS Transportation gives useful information about transportation elements, 
but does not always provides data at the required fine scale. 

 USGS Administrative layer is confusing, as there is little information 
available on what can be done with the service 

 USGS 24k Index5: The USGS 24k Topo Map Boundaries layer is a very 
useful data set, as an up to date version of this layer is important. It happens 
often that quadrangle references or references to a section on a quad-sheet are 
given in submissions for a specific activity. 

 USGS Topographic Base Maps are useful, but there where mixed experiences 
regarding the accessibility of those data. Sometimes no data was available at 
all. It seemed to be a bandwidth issue that could not further be localized. It 
might be an internal problem to USFWS. In any case, the topographic base 
map layers are important information, in particular when combined with Open 
Street Maps data. 

 2012 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)6 data is used often in 
conjunction with state-owned ortho-imagery, available at 6inch resolution, 
flown in winter 2011 and served at a WMS interface. As the NAIP data is 
from summer 2012, both data sets combined allow understanding changes in 
seasons. 

 EPA/USGS National Hydrography Dataset plus (NHDplus)7 catchments are 
an important layer, but even though the connection to the WMS was success, 

                                                

5 “This layer presents the geographic extent of USGS 1:24,000 topographic maps (7.5- by 7.5-minute quadrangles) for 
the conterminous U.S. forty-eight states and District of Columbia. It provides quadrangle name, identification number, 
publication data, and map coverage by state for each quadrangle. This large-scale index grid is appropriate for display 
at more detailed scales.” (http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=4bf2616d2f054fbe92eadcdc9582a765) 
6 “The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) collects leaf-on (as opposed to the more common leaf-off) aerial 
imagery at 1 or 2 meter resolution for the United States. This imagery is used for estimating crop plantings and yields. 
2012 - statewide, 1 meter resolution, 4-band (true color and color-infrared) GeoTIFF tiles” 
(http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/gis/naip.html) 
7 NHDPlus is a geo-spatial, hydrologic framework dataset envisioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency. 
The EPA Office of Water, assisted by the US Geological Survey, has supported the development of NHDPlus to 
enhance the EPA Watershed Assessment, Tracking & Environmental Results (WATERS) activities and the USGS 
National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program's SPARROW modeling. Since its first release in 2006, 
NHDPlus has been made available by EPA to the wider water resources community and has been used for many 
diverse applications inside and outside of EPA and USGS. NHDPlus is an integrated suite of application-ready 
geospatial data sets that incorporate many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), the 
National Elevation Dataset (NED), and the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). NHDPlus Version 1 (NHDPlusV1) 
was released in 2006. NHDPlus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2) began its public debut in June 2012.

no data is available for North Carolina. In those situations, it is difficult to 
understand if no data means that there is indeed no data available, or if the 
service is malfunctioning. Catchment areas are an important data set that 
would ideally be served at a WFS interface. 

 Various USGS WCS services caused various error messages, e.g. EDC 
Landcover. 

In principle, USFWS is interested in having as many base data layers as possible that are 
relevant to a biologist as OGC compliant Web services, ideally WFS. 

7.4.3 Recommendations 

USFWS makes use of a number of USGS data services. As those services become more 
and more important to them, requirements for availability and reliability are high. In 
addition, USFWS uses several client applications, in particular QGIS and ArcGIS. It 
would be important to test USGS services with different versions of those clients and 
provide this information online. Consumers could use it to optimize their systems and 
make better use of the services offered. 

The existing services are already of big value to USFWS. In addition to what is available, 
USFWS would like to get access to water gage information at a WFS interface. The 
USGS water resources division already makes data available as WaterML as a 
proprietary Web service. It would be great to have a WFS serving synoptic sampling 
data, including attributes for time of record, discharge, any chemical constituents 
analyzed, and the sampling location. If those services do exist, they are difficult to 
discover.  

It would be helpful for users to have some sort of service availability overview informing 
about availability of services, as some client tools do not show any error message if no 
data is served. This behavior gives inconsistent experiences to users, as it is not clear if 
the service cannot provide any data for a particular query, or is not behaving properly. 
This is an issue that should be addressed by client developers as well.  

USGS should consider starting a mailing list where people get notified about new 
services becoming available, as working routines often do not include discovery 
activities. For example, USFWS did not know about the availability of NHDplus 
catchment data served at a WFS interface. Clients use what they are used to and often 
only add new services if actively notified about them. Experiences in the past have even 
shown that catalog orchestration often does not really work. Once this issue is solved, 
tools could start polling for new services at a single, top-level endpoint, in contrast to 
many concurrent systems. As an example, USFWS currently uses ServCat8, 
                                                

8 The Natural Resource Program Center (NRPC) is collaborating with the National Park Service’s (NPS) Inventory and 
Monitoring Program to create a centralized place to compile and organize information from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. This repository is called the Service Catalog or ServCat - a Web application available to Fish and Wildlife 
Service employees that compiles documents and organizes data, such as reports, surveys, databases, geospatial data and 
images.

ScienceBase9, and NC One Map, i.e. three different systems with different interfaces and 
APIs. Accessing all three of them through data.gov would simplify the process, but 
requires careful testing of service orchestration aspects.  

7.5 Troup County, GA 

7.5.1 Use Case 

The goal is to make as many data layers available to county officials as required. Due to 
the lack of licenses for commercial products, county officials cannot easily access the 
various data layers, in particular as they are not familiar with open source or free software 
client applications. Therefore, the goal is to develop web based front ends to various data 
sets. The figure below demonstrates this approach using the USGS national elevation 
dataset. The client displays map data from various sources and allows drawing multi-
lines on that map. The elevation data is displayed within a separate window 

 

Figure 7: Troup County client to visualize elevation data using USGS NED 

The front end is currently still under development. The goal is to make it available on 
mobile platforms and to allow capturing new data directly on the mobile device.  

Other examples include an bridge one-stop shop, where all information about bridges 
including elevation data is made available, or various overlays of KML files with current 

                                                

9 Science Base is a collaborative scientific data and information management platform used directly by science teams. 
It provides access to aggregated information derived from many data and information domains, including feeds from 
existing data systems, metadata catalogs, and scientists contributing new and original content.

imagery and topography data layers. The front ends are usually generated using ArcGIS 
Explorer.  

7.5.2 Data & Services 

Troup County tested different several services and experienced some problems 
connecting to it. The most important one is a reliable elevation data, served at a WCS 
interface.  

7.5.3 Recommendations 

Improve communications regarding planned software updates, to allow 
connecting/adapting to the new services once they become available.  

7.6 Oregon Coastal Management Program 

7.6.1 Use Case 

The Oregon Coastal Management Program is a NOAA funded project that works 
vertically between local government along the coast and some state agency and federal 
partners. Horizontally, the project cooperates with counterparts in the states of California 
and Washington. Here, we concentrate on the West Coast Ocean Data Portal, which 
mainly serves as a data and services discovery portal. The portal main site is illustrated 
below.  



OGC 14-079r1 

24 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

Figure 8: West Coast Ocean Data Portal (http://portal.westcoastoceans.org) 

The portal mostly contains ocean-related data, but can allow access to other services as 
well, e.g. those provided by USGS. The goal is to provide simple access to those services, 
serve as a one-stop shop, and advertise data and services to groups not familiar with 
specific data sets.  

The portal is built on an ESRI Geoportal in the background, but with an entirely 
customized user interface. Each service or data set is registered at a CSW (OGC Catalog 
Service), using ISO 19115 metadata records. The catalog then allows access to the data, 
often through multiple formats and protocols, such as WMS, KML, JSON, zipped shape 
files etc.  

The customers of the portal use a variety of tools to interact with the data. The state 
agencies of Oregon have a license agreement with ESRI and can use ESRI GIS products 
(ArcMap with many plugins) to work with data and services. In contrast, local 
governments that cannot afford expensive GIS software either use Web mapping services 
provided as part of the program or a combination of low-level ESRI and open source/free 



OGC 14-079r1 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 25 
 

software tools, with QGIS being the main tool of choice. University partners bring in 
additional tools, as many of them do not come from the ESRI/GIS environment.  

There is an application under development called the MarinePlanner. This application is 
based on OpenLayers, which allows simple integration of many OGC service interfaces. 
The goal of this application is to make many services available at a single point of entry, 
allowing overlay of many services and data types. The planner allows a user to bookmark 
a number of search results from the portal, which are then automatically imported and 
visualized. In this regard, the planner works as an interactive mapping environment. The 
plan is to support all standard OGC service types, such as WMS, WFS, and WCS.  

7.6.2 Data & Services 

The platform features several viewers that mostly work with WMS instances, operated 
and maintained by a variety of partners. Currently, the portal does not use any of the 
USGS services listed on the provided overview, it would be very interesting to add WFS 
Geonames, NHDplus and elevation data (NED) services. In this regard, it has to be noted 
that WCS services can be used directly from within ArcMap, whereas WFS services 
require the installation of the ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension. Even though there 
is a version of the plugin that is offered free of charge, it is a barrier that it does not come 
with any of the low-level ArcMap installation packages.  

7.6.3 Recommendations 

In some cases, GeoJSON would be preferred as a WFS response format. This would 
allow using powerful tools and libraries, such as D310, to analyze and process the data 
without requiring fundamental GIS knowledge on the client side.  

As a general comment, some services use numerical systems to name feature types or 
offered layers or coverages. This might be the default offered by the service 
implementation, but is not very useful for clients to work with. In this situation, clients 
are required to issue further requests, as there is little information that can be retrieved 
from sequential numbers rather than meaningful names.  

7.7 NGA use of USGS Services 

7.7.1 Use Case 

The NGA GeoInt App Store (https://apps.nga.mil) serves as an aggregation portal for 
geospatial intelligence data and services. In this, the NGA App Store is not literally an 
application store, but serves as an access point to all sorts of information, such as data 
served at Web service interfaces operated and maintained mainly by various government

SVG and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying 
yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to 
DOM manipulation.

organizations, ArcGIS scripts, Websites, iOS or Android applications, or any other 
geospatial intelligence related resources that is of value to the user community.  

 

Figure 9: NGA GEOINT App Store (http://apps.nga.mil) 

The app store has entries for various USGS products, such as the national map products 
or the USGS Natural Hazard Support System (NHSS). 

In addition to exposing USGS products in the app store, various groups within NGA 
make direct use of USGS services. Those groups include the Integrated Working Group – 
Readiness, Response and Recovery (IWG-R3), basically NGA’s disaster response group; 
DHS support teams within NGA; or FEMA liaison teams, e.g. with FEMA National 
Response Coordination Center (NRCC11).  

7.7.2 Data & Services 

Several groups within NGA make use of USGS products. Of particular interest are the 
river gauge data, GeoMAC12 data, and data services usually consumed by first 

                                                

11 The FEMA NRCC is a multiagency entity operating from FEMA headquarters that functions as the operational 
component of the DHS NOC. The NRCC coordinates personnel and resource deployments to support disaster 
operations and prioritizes interagency allocation of resources. It maintains situational awareness linkages with regional, 
state, and local partners and 24 x 7 watch team. The NRCC is staffed to support daily monitoring activities with the 
ability to surge in support of catastrophic events. 
12 The Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination or GeoMAC, is an internet-based mapping application originally 
designed for fire managers to access online maps of current fire locations and perimeters in the United States. Using a 
standard web browser, fire personnel can view this information to pinpoint the affected areas. With the growing 
concern of western wildland fires in the summer of 2000, this application also became available to the public 
(http://www.geomac.gov/about.shtml).

responders. Some issues have been experienced in the past with non-matching geodetic 
reference systems, such as WGS84 used by USGS vs. NAD83 used by NGA. 

7.7.3 Recommendations 

The apps in the NGA app store are currently maintained by NGA. It would be highly 
beneficial if those apps could be maintained by USGS directly. An issue is automating 
the process of registering apps. Currently, NGA is not notified if new services come 
online or if existing ones get modified. One possible solution would be to modify the app 
store approach in a way that it harvests metadata about USGS services directly from a 
USGS catalog service.  

Once again, the desire to add some sort of a notification service came up. The service 
would allow users to subscribe to changes applied to services they are using or additional 
services of potential relevance in their field. This would allow users to efficiently adapt to 
changes rather than guessing why a reliable service is not responding anymore.

8 General Recommendations 

In summary, the following recommendations can be made to improve the user experience 
with USGS Web services: 

 The service compliance tests have shown that many services are not fully 
compliant with the OGC standard being tested, with varying relevance for service 
usability. Testing compliance for older service specifications, e.g. WFS 1.1, is 
often limited due to missing conformance classes in the standard and/or limited 
matching between the standard, abstract test suite, and compliance tests 
implementation. Given the high number of existing implementations for those 
services (e.g. 239 WFS 1.1 implementations compared to 39 WFS 2.0 
implementations), it is recommended to rework the old standards and abstract test 
suites and improve the service compliance test implementations. Switching to 
WFS 2.0 is an option, but often not necessary and causes other issues that 
commonly accompany new software releases, in particular in distributed 
environments where clients have been fine-tuned to optimize interaction with 
service instances. 

 The compliance test suite for WFS 1.1 should be reworked to improve service-
testing experiences for service providers, possibly developing a new conformance 
class. For example, Basic WFS 1.1.0.  

 Many service instances are not fully compliant with the service specification, but 
still usable in practice. Therefore a categorization of test results should be 
considered, e.g. “blocker, critical, minor”.  

 The naming of feature types or coverages often follows an opaque naming 
convention. The same incomprehensible name is often used in the “Title” element 
and no further description is provided. Thus, it is very difficult for the user to 
understand what a particular data set can be used for. This is particularly true for 
generic client applications, such as QGIS or ArcGIS, where feature collections 
from WFS are loaded and quickly explored by reading the feature type names and 
titles or descriptions. Informative names such as “BirdHabitat” makes more sense 
than “cg34” and would save the user some time from running additional 
DescribeFeatureType requests (which have been not much more informative in 
some cases). 

 As more and more services are used in complex situations, it is important to use 
proper namespace identifiers. Often, those identifiers change between response 
types. The namespace used in a GetCapabilities response should be identical with 
the one used in a GetFeature response.  

 The CITE website provides direct access to the latest test suites. Those tests can 
be run online by simply providing the own service URL. In order to improve user

experiences, it makes sense to run those tests before publishing a service. The 
CITE website can be found at http://cite.opengeospatial.org. 

 Many users discover a service through the word of mouth rather than catalogs that 
are consulted regularly. Therefore, it would make sense to accompany a service 
with some sort of message board that informs users of planned modifications to 
existing services are updated service offerings. Otherwise, many users give up 
using a particular service due to changed configurations or undocumented down 
times. 

 As there is a large variety of client applications, it would be great if experiences 
regarding interaction of different versions of client applications with the service 
could be provided. Many users don’t have sufficient resources to become OGC 
compliant Web service experts and make the decision to drop using these services 
when error messages occur. A simple “how to use this service” website would 
increase the number of users.

Service Tests 

The detailed reports on service tests are available online at Report 114, Report 215. It has 
to be emphasized that the tests have been performed with limited resources. The goal was 
to help service operators to improve their services.
