This document is a deliverable for the OGC Web Services 8 (OWS-8) testbed activity. 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate standards or revisions to existing standards into OGC's Standards Program, 
where they are formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, 
international teams of technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing 
interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC 
Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments 
and interoperability support services - all designed to encourage rapid development, 
testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards. 

The OWS-8 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommend to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-8 initiative be organized around 
the following threads: 

    * Observation Fusion 

    * Geosynchronization (Gsync) 

    * Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 

    * Aviation

2 Geo-Processing of Earth Observations 

2.1 Introduction 

Ad-hoc processing of Earth Observation (EO) data available through online resources is 
gaining more and more attention. Expected benefits include 

� More versatile EO data access 

� More convenient EO data access 

� Consequently, broadened use and exploitation of EO data 

� An important step towards integration of EO data into automatic chaining and 
orchestration 

� More efficient EO data access: indicating the exact desired result and evaluating 
processing code close to the coverage data source (i.e., on the server) minimizes 
network traffic, one of today’s critical performance limiting factors. 

EO data belong to the class of coverages, i.e., “space/time varying phenomena” as 
defined in ISO 19123 [5] (see below for a more detailed discussion). Therefore, in OGC 
the coverage standards apply to EO discovery, access, processing, and exchange. In 
OWS-8, the following standards have been investigated and put in relation:  

� Web Coverage Service (WCS) 

� Web Coverage Service EO Application Profile (EO-WCS) 

� Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) 

� Web Processing Service (WPS) 

In the subsections below these standards are briefly introduced. 

2.2 Coverage Model 

EO data form a subclass of coverages. The term coverage is defined in ISO 19123 [5], 
which is identical to OGC Abstract Topic 6 [6], as, roughly speaking, a representation of 
a space/time varying phenomenon. This generic, abstract coverage definition does not yet 
allow for interoperable implementations – there can be – and are, in fact – many different 
implementations of the abstract ISO coverage definition which, however, do not allow 
interchange of coverage documents among each other. 



OGC 11-116

While ISO 19123 defines a generic, abstract coverage model, the OGC GML Application 
Schema for Coverages[3] establishes a concrete coverage model which implements ISO 
19123 and allows for interoperable implementations, including concise conformance 
testing. This Application Schema for Coverages is based on GML 3.2.1 [1]; by defining 
coverage data structures through XML (with XML Schema and Schematron) a clear, un-
ambiguous semantics is established which also allows a concise mapping to represent-
ations in other data format encodings, such as GeoTIFF. 

From the set of coverages defined by ISO 19123 and GML, two coverage subtypes are 
relevant for EO: RectifiedGridCoverages consist of values assigned to points which are 
aligned to a grid with equidistant spacing and with a clear positioning in space and time. 
L1 and higher-level EO products fall into this category. ReferenceableGridCoverages, on 
the other hand, have an underlying grid which is not bound to this restriction of equidist-
ance; random distances between grid lines, as well as curvilinear grid lines, are possible. 
Typical use cases include L0 EO data. 

2.3 WCS 

Based on the coverage model outlined, OGC offers service standards for finding, access-
ing, and processing of coverages. At the heart is the Web Coverage Service (WCS). WCS 
actually is not a single standard, but a modular suite of standards. WCS Core [2] 
establishes the basic service together with functionality for accessing and 
subsettingcoverages; all WCS implementations must conform to this Core. Several 
extensions add bespoke extra functionality which implementations optionally may offer. 
Among these extensions are several protocol bindings (currently: GET, POX, and 
SOAP), service extensions like scaling & interpolation, CRS transformation, a coverage 
query language, and upload of coverages to a server. Format encoding extensions allow 
to send and receivecoverages in a number of formats, such as GML, GeoTIFF, JPEG200, 
NetCDF, and HDF. (Note that, at the time of this writing, not all extensions are already 
available.) 

2.4 WCPS 

The OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) language standard [8]defines a 
raster query language in the style of SQL and XQuery. This query language allows 
processing and filtering on multi-dimensional raster coverages1. Figure 1 illustrates some 
representative use cases. As a concrete example, let us look at the query “From MODIS 
scenes M1, M2, and M3, the absolute of the difference between red and nir, in HDF-EOS 
- but only those where nir exceeds 127 somewhere inside region R". In WCPS syntax this 
is expressed as 

for $c in ( M1, M2, M3 ), 
    $r in ( R ) 
where 

                                                
1In the EarthServer project (www.earthserver.eu) starting Fall 2011, the WCPS language will be extended to address all 
coverage types defined in the GML Application Schema for Coverages[3].

    some( $c.nir> 127 and $r ) 
return  
    encode( 
       abs( $c.red - $c.nir ), 
       "nitf" 
    ) 

 

Figure 1: Representative WCPS use cases. 

WCPS is a standalone language specification which, however, is tied into the WCS suite 
as a “Coverage Processing Extension”. On WPS side, it is linked in as a “Coverage 
Processing Application Profile”. 

2.5 EO-WCS 

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) Application Profile – Earth Observation (EO-
WCS), defines a profile of WCS 2.0 [OGC 09-110r3] for use on Earth Observation data. 
An Application Profile bundles several specifications and possibly adds additional 
requirements on an implementation. Extra requirements can be additions (for example, 
Dataset Series are introduced by this specification) or constraints (for example, coverages 
offered are restricted to 2-D rasters).  

In terms of EO processing, EO-WCS offers several specific relevant functionalities: 

� A data model extending 2-D EO scenes with a time dimension and EO metadata 

� hierarchical grouping of coverage sets 

� spatio-temporal EO coverage discovery

2.6 WPS 

The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) standard [10] defines a generic method of 
remotely invoking geoprocessing performed in a server. WPS as such describes processes 
in terms of their function signature (i.e., input and output parameter types), but does not 
have any concrete domain semantics associated in a machine readable format like any 
other OGC Web Service (e.g. Semantics of WMS Layer are also not included in a WMS 
response) ; Syntactic interoperability is thereby achieved. This behavior keeps it open for 
any kind of processing. This lack of machine-readable semantics is illustrated in Figure 2: 
the semantics of function “buffer” is only described by freetext elements title and 
abstract.  

 

Figure 2: WPS process semantics described by freetext fields. 

Therefore, the WPS standard already suggests to establish focused Application Profiles 
which restrict themselves to particular domains and functionality classes and achieve 
semantic interoperability. An example of such an application profile is the WCPS 
Application Profile for WPS, which has been submitted to the OGC WPS Standards 
Working Group (WPS.SWG) establishing WCPS as a WPS Application Profile [8], 
thereby enabling interoperable processing services on coverages. 

3 OWS-8 Geoprocessing Experiments 

3.1 52 North: WPS 

The 52°North WPS served as processing and orchestration engine as shown in Figure 3. 

The orchestration part was performed as an opaque Geoprocessing workflow. The work-
flow was encoded as the 52North Geoprocessing Orchestration Script and contained three 
WPS Services. The orchestration WPS requests the first WPS in the Geoprocessing 
workflow and provides all datasets which are send by the client. Since the datasets are

sent by reference, the WPS resolves these references from the EOX WCS and aggregates 
them by using a GRASS function in the backend. 

The results are served back to the orchestration WPS, which calls the second WPS in the 
workflow with the results of the first WPS. 

 

Figure 3: WPS orchestration. 

This WPS resolves the references for the input data from the first WPS and normalizes 
them via a Z-Transformation. 

The results are send back by reference to the orchestration WPS. That WPS calls the third 
WPS in the workflow, which also resolves the input data from the previous WPS and 
performs a Masking task in the basis of some java algorithm.

3.2 EOxServer: WCS, EO-WCS 

A demonstration of the EO-WCS functionality was provided at the two service endpoints 
http://ows.eox.at/cci/ows? and http://ows.eox.at/ofc/ows?. A summary of the available 
data and some sample requests can be found at http://ows.eox.at. Note that these 
demonstration services serve data for the OWS-8 demonstration scenarios namely the 
"Monterey Earthquake emergency response scenario" in the Cross-Community 
Interoperability (CCI) thread and the "Amazon Drought analysis" scenario in the 
Observation Fusion – Coverages (OFC) sub-thread. 

For the "Amazon Drought analysis" scenario a selected set of products from the 
ENVISAT MERIS L1 Full Resolution Full Swath (FRS) collection is offered online and 
was used in the drought analysis. The selection covers the Amazon area i.e. the spatial 
bounding box spanning from 10° North to 20° South and 45° West to 80° West with as 
few clouds as possible. Only images taken in the July, August, September period of 2009 
are part of the set. The MERIS data is offered via EO-WCS grouped together into one 
DatasetSeries. 

The second data offered is the FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active 
Radiation) band from MERIS Global Vegetation Index (MGVI) L3 products [WR3]. This 
band is available from the monthly products for July, August, and September in the years 
from 2006 to 2010 again via EO-WCS grouped together into one DatasetSeries. 

Additionally both DatasetSeries are also available via EO-WMS. 

The consumption of these datasets both by the WPS services and by the PYXIS client 
directly was demonstrated successfully in the frame of OWS-8. 

3.3 Rasdaman: WCS, WCPS, WPS 

A rasdaman database was established with multi-dimensional holdings. The PYXIS client 
accessed this database.

4 Findings 

Coverage processing spans a wide field, with frequently varying, if not contradicting, 
requirements: 

� From simple access over repeating fixed processing to complex, specialized 
processes 

� From ad-hoc, individual one-off requests over repeating parametrized tasks to 
standing queries 

� From interactive, exploratory access to routinely invoked, automated tasks 
 

In the context of this discussion it is noteworthy that this query language is restricted in 
expressive power: it cannot perform recursive or iterated function calls. This restriction is 
necessary to obtain a language which is “safe in evaluation”, i.e.: every possible request 
is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of steps. Well known from database 
languages, this “security belt” safeguards against a class of Denial of Service attacs. 

It turns out that the specifications investigated are not competing, but together provide a 
powerful, versatile Swiss Army Knife to address the complete spectrum of coverage pro-
cessing. Notably this is not constrained to EO data in the narrower sense, i.e., satellite im-
agery. According to the participants’ experience, this likewise applies, for example, to 
atmospheric and ocean data. 

As a recommendation, service providers may use Table 1 as a decision aid. It consists of 
the following categories: 

� Simplicity of use by clients: Important factor in all applications 
� New Function Effort: Effort for implementing new functionality on the server 

side 
� Reusability of existing Functions: Effort for reusing exiting functionality, e.g. 

algorithms in other programs/formats 
� Expressive Power: Measurement of how expressive the service protocol is 
� Functional Flexibility: How Flexible is the standard to adapt new requirements 
� Data Flexibility: How Flexible is the standard to use new datasources

EO-WCS + - / o5 o - 

WCPS6 o … +7 +8 --9 +10 + - 

WPS + -11 ++ ++ -12 + 

 

In summary, this can roughly be simplified to the following recommendation for 
coverage processes: 

� For comparatively narrowly defined tasks, use WCS Core and Extensions; 
� For ad-hoc processing and filtering where queries are not known in advance, but 

can be expressed analytically, and data is known and under control of the same 
service, use WCPS with a host service such as WCS or WPS; 

� For well-defined processing tasks of algorithmic complexity or for proprietary 
algorithms and where data source shall be held loosely coupled/flexible as well as 
for orchestration tasks to shield complexity, use WPS. 

                                                
2 No changes possible 
3 Adding an extension requires server-side programming 
4 Only choice is to implement a conformance class or not 
5 Functionality is specialized towards satellite image data, but not built, e.g., for 4D/5D atmoslpheric and ocean data 
6 Identical in all aspects to WPS Coverage Processing Application Profile  
7 Query writing effort depends on task complexity 
8Client phrases new query, no change on server side required 
9Only querys formulated in WCPS can be used. No existing legacy systems/code 
10Expressions of unlimited complexity 
11Changes require server-side programming 
12Process code implemented cannot be influenced by the client, parameters can be influenced
