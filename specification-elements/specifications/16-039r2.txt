Abstract

This engineering report examines the role of geospatial semantic technology in the domain of civil aviation. Many aeronautical services (providing information on request or processing the data) are based on OGC Web Service specifications. A number of aeronautical services possess geospatial attributes. The aviation services follow OWS Common Service requirements but also have domain specific capabilities. Services metadata is often very relevant for service consumption, especially in the SOA environment of aviation’s System Wide Information Management (SWIM). Therefore, it shall be exposed to consumer stakeholders for either design or runtime service discovery in an efficient, standardized way.




This ER starts introducing the WSDOM service ontology developed by FAA for semantic service discovery. It  proposes several extensions useful for OWS compatible, geospatial aviation services. It combines GeoSPARQL with WSDOM ontology and FAA service classification taxonomies and elaborates the interoperability between ontology based WSDOM and OWS compatible service descriptions.




Business Value

Geospatial enabled semantic service metadata discovery proposals, as described in this report, provide valuable technical and organizational improvements for the SOA governance, especially regarding the service configuration, discovery, and consumption in the aviation’s System Wide Information Management (SWIM).




What does this ER mean for the Working Group and OGC in general

The document demonstrates the combination of OGC semantic standards (GeoSPARQL) with service description methodology developed by the FAA (WSDOM) for the domain of civil aviation and aeronautical traffic management. It also elaborates the interoperability between WSDOM ontology an the OWS GetCapabilities taxonomy used to describe geospatial services. Therefore, it demonstrates the importance and usefulness of OGC standards to solve the complex, real world tasks such as those from the transportation domain.




How does this ER relates to the work of the Working Group

This report proposes the use of OGC standards developed by the OGC Geosemantics DWG, such as the GeoSPARQL, with ontology based service descriptions for the domain of civil aviation and the air traffic management. The report clearly stresses the importance of geosemantics for the service discovery in a SOA environment and also highlights the need for an equivalent, ontological, interoperable representation for OWS GetCapabilities metadata documents.

5. Overview



This engineering report explores the options for use of semantic geospatial technology to describe and discover the OGC Web Services (OWS) [7] in the aviation domain. It starts giving a short introduction into the concept of semantic service description and discovery using WSDOM [17] ontology and considering the characteristics of OWS and the specific aviation traffic management needs.




The usefulness of ontology based service metadata descriptions for geospatial service discovery tasks was explained and several extensions for WSDOM ontology proposed. The extensions enhance WSDOM ontology for service classification taxonomy but also utilizes the results of OGC Geosemantics DWG (http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/semantics) in the area of geospatial semantic proposing GeoSPARQL as the language of choice for service discovery. Much attention has also been given to the interoperability between the WSDOM ontological service representations and the equivalent OGC OWS compatible metadata descriptions.




Finally, the report shortly describes a solution stack used to deploy ontologies and create temporary semantic service registry in order to test and verify extensions and code examples (query and metadata) used for semantic discovery.








6. Status Quo & New Requirements Statement



6.1. Status Quo


WSDOM is a formal ontological model based on OWL-S and FAA Service Taxonomies that is being developed by FAA for use in building applications that process and exchange web service information. It can be used to describe and discover service metadata instances using semantic technology. While it provides good basis for extensions, the WSDOM ontology needs additional metadata to fully classify services, describe their characteristics and express their geospatial properties. It further doesn’t include rules and axioms for reasoning nor supports mapping between WSDOM and OWS GetCapabilities document. The current WSDOM specification also lacks the description of use case scenarios, service discovery query examples and a referent demonstration/test environment.






6.2. Requirements Statement


No formal requirements are required or specified for this engineering report. The list below provides the major goals put on this report formatted in a requirement like fashion.




Requirements




	
Semantic aviation service description shall enable discovery based on geospatial criteria.


	
Semantic aviation service description for OWS compatible aviation services shall be interoperable with Service Description documents provided by "getCapabilities".


	
Semantic service discovery shall be performed based on standard ontology query languages SPARQL and GeoSPARQL.


	
Service discovery shall support deducing of facts about services based on the concept of reasoning.













7. Solutions



Considered and proposed solutions which were investigated during the preparation phase and the work on this ER include following areas:




	
Extensions for semantic geospatial properties;


	
Extensions for interoperability with GetCapabilities document; and


	
Extensions for aviation service classification concepts.







7.1. Targeted Solutions


Targeted solution includes several extensions for WSDOM ontology. Three of them are detailed elaborated and the extensions are proposed at the implementation level.




	
The first one is dedicated to the geospatial service metadata and related to GeoSPARQL query language and required ontological extensions in WSDOM.


	
The second one is focused on the interoperability between WSDOM and getCapabilities service metadata. It presents the work already done in describing OGC Geospatial Web Services using OWL-S Web Service ontologies, elaborates the limitations and options for integration with WSDOM service ontology.


	
The third one includes a part of FAA Service Taxonomy (FAA-STD-066) encoded in OWL and made available for service metadata description.









7.2. Recommendations


Based on the investigation results presented in this report, the following recommendations are made to enable and improve the process surrounding the semantic service discovery in the aviation domain:




	
Include all concepts from FAA Service Taxonomies into WSDOM ontology;


	
Extend WSDOM ontology for service discovery concepts using GeoSPARQL;


	
Support the methods (mappings, extensions) for interoperability between WSDOM and OGC specific service metadata;


	
Explore the importance of axioms and reasoning for service discovery; and


	
Explore WSDOM ontology for interoperability with the concepts described in SCR (SWIM Common Registry).













8. Discovery of OGC OWS compatible services in the aviation domain



8.1. Introduction


In order to understand the needs for service discovery in the domain of aviation, this section provides several use cases, which require aviation services to be described and discovered using semantic technology. The use cases are related to the common capabilities provided by traditional aeronautical information systems. The major difference is in a new assumption regarding the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) - inside SWIM, numerous aviation services might be provided by various authorized service providers. Such diversity requires the services to be properly described in order to be successfully discovered and consumed.




With highly flexible SWIM anticipated, the aeronautical data retrieval becomes more complex. Many aviation information services will be available in SWIM and the complete knowledge about characteristics and capabilities they provide (operational, data types, spatial coverage), as well as the implementation details will not always be explicitly available. With other words, the availability of service metadata consolidated in a centralized SWIM catalogue/registry for the purpose of service discovery is important precondition for successful service consumption.




8.1.1. Use case: Preparation for flight execution


Preparation for flight execution includes data dissemination in order to create a report called a pre-flight information bulletin (or pre‐ flight and in‐flight aeronautical information publications). Traditionally, an aeronautical information system (AIS) provides information services, which offer all kinds of aeronautical information required to create the bulletin. The information is usually retrieved from confident, centralized data sources, for example from a well known central database operated by an aeronautical service provider.




Pre-flight information bulletin requires mashup of aeronautical (AIXM), weather (WXXM), flight (FIXM) and map data. They will be delivered by services discovered based on operational, spatial (region) or non-functional (security, QoS) characteristics. Pieces of information representing the entities of aeronautical infrastructure like the routes, airspaces, NOTAMs, emergency airports, navigation aids, initial flight plan and weather forecasts information could originate from multiple data sources and be provided by several distinctive service providers. How many services will assist in creation of pre-flight information bulletin depends on the discovery results and is related to individual capabilities of services available in the SWIM service pool.






8.1.2. Use case: Flight planning service


In order to create and submit flight plans different kinds of aeronautical data shall be retrieved using SWIM service pool. Additionally, the more processing oriented services such as the flight plan validator service are likely to be required in order to assist the planning.




Finally, flight plan shall be submitted to some regulatory instance such as Network Manager.




Prior to the flight execution, sensitive and critical information concerning the state of the atmosphere with respect to temperature, humidity, transmissivity, and condition is necessary to adjust flight plans before and during their execution.




Service discovery for this use case would include searching for service providers capable to provide airspace, routes and airport informations, as well as the sources of so called notices for airman (NOTAM) and data validation service instances.






8.1.3. Use case: Airport slot trading


Airport slots are periodically assigned to airlines following strict operational rules. Under certain conditions an airline can initiate a desire to trade slots (buy, sell, lease in, lease out, or swap). To support the concept of slot market a semantic discovery might be used during the preparation phase in order to identify the regional or global slot traders or slot swapping offers for a particular airport.












9. OGC web service metadata



9.1. Introduction


If an OWS service shall additionally be described using semantic metadata like the WSDOM, it is important to explore how the mandatory metadata information provided by GetCapabilities could be synchronized with equivalent semantic metadata representation. The goal here is to achieve interoperability and eliminate metadata redundancy, while preserving OWS compatibility. This clause provides an introduction into the service metadata description of OGC Compatible Web Services as mandated in the OWS specification and specifies possible mappings to WSDOM properties.






9.2. Service capability document taxonomy


The mandatory GetCapabilities operation allows clients to retrieve a Capabilities XML document providing metadata for the specific service implementation. For example, the WFS service type is required to provide a GetCapabilities implementation to request an XML metadata document roughly describing:




	
The organization providing the service;


	
The WFS operations provided by the service;


	
A list of feature types that the service can operate on; and


	
A list of filtering capabilities that the service supports.







Slightly different document formats are specified for other OWS service types such as WMS or WPS services. More details are provided in chapter 11, in the section dedicated to the interoperability between WSDOM ontology and GetCapabilities documents.






9.3. OGC catalogue service


Catalogue services support the ability to publish and search collections of descriptive information (metadata) for data, services, and related information objects. Metadata in catalogues represent resource characteristics that can be queried and presented for evaluation and further processing by both humans and software. Catalogue services are required to support the discovery and binding to registered information resources within an information community.




However, the current OGC catalogue service specification only supports taxonomies, which means it is not suited for semantic based service discovery. In order to support semantic discovery, an interesting extension proposals in form of an OWL Extension Profile for CWS [11] in form of OGC discussion paper has been made. The document describes the ontological approach in general but also provides some details regarding the discovery service end points specifications.










10. WSDOM Ontology



10.1. Introduction


WSDOM is a formal Web Service description ontological model that is being developed by FAA for use in building applications that process and exchange web service information. The ontology supports both syntactical and semantical characteristics of services and provides quite good basis for further enhancements. The evaluation starts with comparison of WSDOM and other similar solutions.






10.2. The structure


The WSDOM ontology was designed based on the OWL-S service ontology and considering the service taxonomies used by FAA. The WSDOM 1.1 release consists of six OWL files and three RDF files. The three of them provides ontological representation of FAA standard taxonomies [7].




The structure follows the OWL-S model defining the Service ontology as being the top level ontology with three related classes: ServiceProfile (maps to OWL-S ServiceProfile).








Figure 1. Service Ontology




ServiceInterface (maps to OWL-S ServiceModel) and ServiceImplementation (maps to OWL-S ServiceGrounding). This structure also corresponds to that described in the Preparation of Web Service Description from [8].








Figure 2. Interface Ontology




These three classes are further refined by three additional ontologies for web services: WSProfile, WSInterface, and WSImplementation respectively.








Figure 3. Profile Ontology




There are also two other ontologies with associated taxonomies derived from FAA-STD-065 [8]: Stakeholder (equivalent of deprecated OWL-S Agent ontology) and Document (captures the various classes of artifacts used in SOA-based implementations).










11. WSDOM Extension Proposal



11.1. Introduction


This clause describes several extension proposals for WSDOM ontology version 1.1. The WSDOM extensions shall enable efficient discovery of OWS aviation services and helps to create a service knowledge base. The proposals enhance the ontology with concepts from FAA Service Taxonomies  [1] and also include the geospatial semantic [3].




The interoperability between OWS service meta data documents (provided by "GetCapabilities") and semantic service descriptions such as the WSDOM was explained in a dedicated chapter.




The term extension means here the terminology extensions for WSDOM (ABox), service metadata and other instances (TBox), as well as the axioms/rules (RBox). The terms ABox and TBox are used to describe two different types of statements in ontologies. TBox statements describe a system in terms of controlled vocabularies, for example, a set of classes and properties (WSDOM), while ABox are statements about individuals (service metadata description elements, instances) belonging to those concepts.






11.2. WSDOM structure and extension strategies


There are several ways to extend an ontology. An ontology can import and utilize the concepts defined in other ontologies, therefore, ontologies can be composed out of several distinctive external ontologies.




The OWL, a semantic language used to model the WSDOM, provides three increasingly expressive versions designed for particular purposes.




	
OWL Lite is a very simple classification hierarchy.


	
OWL DL is a description logic language, allowing expressivity and decidability for reasoning.


	
OWL Full has maximum expressiveness but does not guarantee computational completeness or decidability.







An OWL profile constraint influences the overall expressiveness of ontology an can enable or disable the reasoning. Therefore, the extensions proposed here will consider the profile constraints of original WSDOM 1.1 implementation but the OWL DL is required if the axioms and the data inference shall be used in a full fledged service knowledge base.




The WSDOM has been designed as a combination of several autonomous ontologies delivered in a separated files and linked together using external import mechanism provided by the Protege ontology editor. For verification of proposed extensions all concepts have to be loaded into an ontology server/repository with query engine and reasoner components and access to all ontology elements and imports relevant for service discovery.




Extensions can be incorporated into an ontology through the inclusion of additional concepts (classes and properties), creating new elements using multiple inheritance, extended properties value/range or specifying additional declarative rules/axioms (class and property equivalence, transition rules). New concepts like new classes created by inheritance, which introduce new properties can be used to enhance already available concepts and individuals without invalidate them (related to original ontology). This kind of extension mechanism is used for WSDOM to include geospatial properties into standard service description individuals. An alternative to multiple types for service descriptions would be to derive a new class using multiple inheritance:








Figure 4. Multiple Inheritance vs. Individual Types




Extensions explained here are all focused on the “ServiceProfile” class from the WSDOM. They affect several properties as shown on the high level ServiceProfile class diagram below.








Figure 5. WSDOM Service Profile




"ServiceProfile" class provides a good extension point. This class acts as container for the most relevant  metadata, such as service functions and real world effects, quality of service, security parameters, service providers and consumers. As part of extensions proposed here, the service profile class will be enriched with additional classes, properties and individuals.




Individuals of "ServiceProfile" type can contain one or many properties depicting the concept of "Service function" associated with "real world effects". In order to extend the ontology to provide controlled vocabulary (values) for these concepts, domain experts need to define taxonomy of business functions and real world effects based on aviation traffic (management) domain needs.




Related to OWS compatible OGC service, the variety of possible "real world effects" seems to be limited on retrieval and processing of aviation data. With other words, if an aviation service is an OWS service, that service is likely to be either one of data provider service types (WFS, WMS, WCS) or to perform calculations/processing (WPS). This implies that the real world effects of OGC compatible aviation services are limited to “receive/store/modify/transform aviation data”. Although it could be designed that way, real world operational effects (such as flight cancellation or flight rerouting) are unlikely to be implemented using OWS compatible service endpoints, because such implementation wouldn’t be compliant with the purpose of OWS services (which is primary the data retrieval).




As part of ServiceProfile the class described in the diagram as “Categorization Facets” obviously represents a placeholder kept for ontology extensions to link profile instances with some service categorization. One of extensions presented in this ER will include a subset of FAA Service Taxonomy transformed to OWL and encoded as hierarchical class structure. It however won’t utilize that “categorization facet” concept as it was suggested in the original WSDOM ontology. Instead, service profile instances will receive additional class types in accordance with service categorization.




11.2.1. Service Topology and Taxonomy


The figure below represents two major enhancements of WSDOM proposed in this ER. Beside the concepts of “Service” and “ServiceProfile” from original ontology, part of FAA Service Taxonomy and GeoSPARQL spatial attributes are added to the ontology to support service categorization and geo referencing.








Figure 6. WSDOM and Proposed Extensions




Geospatial Support


This section describes an extension related to the OGC GeoSPARQL ontology and query language. The idea is to semantically model the geospatial characteristics of aviation services by capturing geographical regions for which they provide useful capabilities and business functions.




To describe spatial properties which characterize services and their capabilities, an ontology and query language provided by OGC, the GeoSPARQL [3], will be integrated into WSDOM. The individuals of ServiceProfile shall additionally implement a new geo:Featuretype type from GeoSPARQL. Doing so, service descriptions will contain a geometry property needed for spatial reasoning and querying.




Proposed extensions enable service discovery (using SPARQL [2] or GeoSPARQL) based on service category and topological characteristics, which satisfy the query criteria.






FAA Service Taxonomy


For the extension concerning the FAA Service Taxonomy concepts a semantic equivalent of original categorization hierarchy will be created using an ontology editor (Protege). This extension will focus on aeronautical and aviation related categories for purpose of this document. The integration with WSDOM ontology will occur via service profile individuals. Those instances that originally instantiate “ServiceProfile” type will also receive additional types in accordance with FAA Service Taxonomy.










11.3. GeoSPARQL


11.3.1. Introduction


It would significantly enhance both the service description expressiveness and the discovery capabilities, if WSDOM ontology would support geo semantic relations and spatial querying. Therefore, this section presents a geo spatial extension of SPARQL and explains how it could be integrated into WSDOM ontology.




SPARQL is a protocol and query language for the Semantic Web, while the OGC GeoSPARQL is a geographic query language for RDF Data. It defines additional vocabulary for representing geospatial data in RDF and defines an extension to the SPARQL query language for querying those data. It additionally specifies OWL classes and properties for representing geographical features and their geometries.




GeoSPARQL provides following features:




	
An RDF/OWL vocabulary for representing spatial information;


	
A set of functions for spatial computations; and


	
A set of query transformation rules.







The GeoSPARQL specification contains the definition of a vocabulary to represent features, geometries, and their relationships, as well as a set of domain-specific, spatial functions for use in SPARQL queries. GeoSPARQL follows a modular design.




	
A core component defines OWL classes for spatial objects.


	
A geometry component defines RDFS data types for serializing geometry data, RDFS/OWL classes for geometry object types, geometry-related RDF properties, and non-topological spatial query functions for geometry objects.


	
A geometry topology component defines topological query functions.


	
A topological vocabulary component defines RDF properties for asserting topological relations between spatial objects.


	
A query rewrite component defines rules for transforming a simple triple pattern that tests a topological relation between two features into an equivalent query involving concrete geometries and topological query functions.







GeoSPARQL supports both quantitative and qualitative spatial reasoning:




	
A quantitative spatial reasoning involves concrete geometries for features where distances and topological relations can be explicitly calculated; and


	
Qualitative geospatial reasoning allow topological inferences for features where the geometries are not directly considered.







One example of qualitative reasoning would be the one with consideration of transitive relations. Spatial relation "contains" is transitive: if A contains B and B contains C then A contains C as well and query execution can be preformed even without explicit geometric calculations and tests.






11.3.2. GeoSPARQL Ontology


The ontology for representing features and geometries includes a class geo:SpatialObject, with two primary subclasses, geo:Feature and geo:Geometry. GeoSPARQL specification contains an ontological part with classes and properties and a part dealing with query specification. They task is to enable service discovery with geospatial querying.








Figure 7. GeoSPARQL Essential Classes




The concepts described in GeoSPARQL are designed to be used together with the concepts specified in the domain ontology, which shall be augmented with geospatial properties. Having said that, every domain class, which has spatial characteristics and shall be captured by spatial queries shall instantiate the class geo:Feature. Features relate to their geometries via the geo:hasGeometry property. For example, an airport is a geo:Feature. A representation of the real world location becomes a geo:Geometry. GeoSPARQL provides different OWL classes for the geometry hierarchies associated with geometry representations for many different geometry types such as point, polygon, curve, arc, and multicurve. It also includes two different ways to represent geometry literals and their associated type hierarchies: WKT and GML. The geo:asWKT and geo:asGML properties link the geometry entities to the geometry literal representations. Values for these properties use the geo-sf: WKTLiteral and geo-gml:GMLLiteral data types respectively.






11.3.3. GeoSPARQL and Spatial Relationships


GeoSPARQL includes a standard way to query for topological relationships, such as overlaps, between spatial entities. These come in the form of:




	
Binary properties between the entities; and


	
Geospatial filter functions.







The topological binary properties can be used in SPARQL query triple patterns like a normal property (relation). Primarily they are used between objects of the geo:Geometry type. The properties can be expressed using three distinct vocabularies:




	
The OGC Simple Features;


	
Egenhofer 9-intersection model; and


	
RCC8.







The Simple Features topological relations include equals, disjoint, intersects, touches, within, contains, overlaps, and crosses.




Geospatial filter functions provide two different types of functionality. First, there are operator functions which take multiple geometries as predicates and produce either a new geometry or another datatype as a result. The second type of functionality is boolean topological tests of geometries. The major difference related to topological binary properties is that these functions take the geometry literals as parameters, while the binary properties take geo:Geometry and geo:Feature entities.








Figure 8. WSDOM Service Profile




As depicted in the ontology editor screenshot above, the GeoSPARQL ontology provides rich semantic structure used to specify geometries and relations. Topological properties such as “cross”, “cover”, “touch”, “intersect” and “disjoint” are listed on the right side.








Figure 9. WSDOM GeoSPARQL Extension




GeoSPARQL topological properties are usually derived based on spatial reasoning (qualitative spatial reasoning) inside of GeoSPARQL compatible data stores during the GeoSPARQL query evaluation.




Minimalistic Spatial Query


PREFIX serv: <http://example.org/ApplicationSchema#>
PREFIX geo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#>
PREFIX geof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/>

SELECT ?f
WHERE {
    serv:A my:hasExactGeometry ?aGeom .
    ?aGeom geo:asWKT ?aWKT .
    ?f serv:hasExactGeometry ?fGeom .
    ?fGeom geo:asWKT ?fWKT .
    FILTER (geof:sfContains(?aWKT, ?fWKT) && !sameTerm(?aGeom, ?fGeom))
}






The spatial query example searches for all instances of class ServiceProfile, which geometry is contained inside of one other geometry.




FAA Service Taxonomy and GeoSPARQL extensions could be integrated into WSDOM service descriptions as additional types for  ServiceProfile individuals. That means, ServiceProfile individuals shall instantiate gml:Feature. For example, a service called “NOTAM” is an geospatial "AeronauticalInfomationService":




ServiceProfile with Extensions


<owl:Thing rdf:ID="NOTAM" />
<owl:Thing rdf:about="#NOTAM">
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="#AeronauticalInformationService"/>
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="#ServiceProfile"/>
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="gml:Feature"/>
</owl:Thing>






Service profile instance receives a new type (rdf:typeOf) as specified in the FAA service taxonomy (AeronauticalInformationService). It also receives additional geometry type (gml:Feature). During the query execution, a SPARQL query engine can now identify that the service instance represents a NOTAM service. With a spatial type put in place the query engine and reasoners can identify geometry properties and execute GeoSPARQL queries with spatial relations and geometry filters.




An alternative would be to use multiple inheritance to create new profile classes:




ServiceProfile with geospatial extensions


<owl:Class rdf:ID="GeospatialServiceProfile">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#ServiceProfile" />
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&gml;Feature" />
</owl:Class>

<owl:Thing rdf:ID="NOTAM" />
<owl:Thing rdf:about="#NOTAM">
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="#GeospatialServiceProfile"/>
</owl:Thing>






This approach has advantage that the individuals instantiate the geospatial profile and don’t instantiate multiple classes.








11.4. FAA Service Taxonomy


In order to enable the use of service classifications for the aviation domain, this section proposes an extension with classification provided in Appendix A from FAA Service Taxonomy [7]. The extension requires the original plain text categorization to be represented using equivalent ontological OWL form. This task was manually performed using Protege ontology editor:








Figure 10. FAA Taxonomy Classes




The figure displays a subset of overall FAA Service Taxonomy in ontological form for demonstration purposes. The taxonomy has been modeled in OWL as hierarchical class structure with inheritance.




The hierarchical categorization presented here has been modeled using inheritance. The WSDOM ontology (ServiceProfile) already contained a property aimed for service classification. In WSProfile.owl there is a class named "ServiceCategory" with property "hasServiceCategry". Service profile individual shall therefore contain one or many “hasServiceproperty” properties, which reference service category instances. For this option a query expressed in pseudo language would look like this:





"Select all Services that have WSProfile, which has property "hasServiceCategrory" associated with  NOTAMService instance".






Alternatively, service categories can also be modeled by creating a class hierarchy (as it has been depicted in the figure). Service class individuals implement one or many category classes. A query example in pseudo language:





"Select all Services that are NOTAMService."






The third option is related to the original proposal from the ontology. Service categories are modeled using class hierarchy and a service profile individual additionally implements one or more category classes. A query looks a little bit more complex compared to the previous one:





"Select all Services that have WSProfile that is NOTAMService."






Even if the "Service" class was said to be just a container for binding, profile and implementation concepts it feels the most naturally to introduce subclasses of class Service for all aviation service category. An alternative would be to do the same with "ServiceProfile" class.




However, both approaches preferred here are not fully aligned with WSDOM’s "property based" service categorization. If the categorization would be implemented using properties, the ontology has to provide a class hierarchy category for categorization taxonomy and an additional instance/individual for every category. This approach would also make queries look more complex. It also does not reflect the fact that a service IS an aviation service of particular type.




The usage has been depicted on the class diagram and code examples below. Again, instead of having service profile class instances linking to a particular classification category using property mechanism (as it has been suggested in the WSDOM), service profile individuals shall receive an additional class type according to chosen category. This approach has been demonstrated in the following OWL listing (in XML):




Service individual implements profile and taxonomy types


<owl:Class rdf:ID="AeronauticalInformationService">
</owl:Class>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="NOTAMService">
</owl:Class>

<owl:Thing rdf:ID="D-NOTAM" />

<owl:Thing rdf:about="#D-NOTAM">
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="#AeronauticalInformationService"/>
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="#NOTAMService"/>
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="#ServiceProfile"/>
</owl:Thing>






An instance/individual called D-NOTAM of type "ServiceProfile" IS also a "NOTAMService" and "AeronauticalInformationService". Following figure provides visual explanation using class diagram notation.








Figure 11. WSDOM FAA Taxonomy Extension




An alternative would be to create new aviation service profile classes which would inherit from the WSDOM’s service profile:




ServiceProfile individual with concept from service taxonomy


<owl:Class rdf:ID="AeronauticalInformationServiceProfile">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#ServiceProfile" />
</owl:Class>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="NOTAMServiceProfile">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#ServiceProfile" />
</owl:Class>

<owl:Thing rdf:ID="D-NOTAM" />

<owl:Thing rdf:about="#D-NOTAM">
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="#AeronauticalInformationServiceProfile"/>
  <rdf:type rdf:resource="#NOTAMServiceProfile"/>
</owl:Thing>






This extension approach seems to be a little bit more compact compared to the first one. An advantage would however become more clearer if one considers the GeoSPARQL extensions, as well.




ServiceProfile with geospatial and taxonomy extensions


<owl:Class rdf:ID="GeospatialAeronauticalInformationServiceProfile">
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#ServiceProfile" />
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&gml;Feature" />
</owl:Class>

<owl:Thing rdf:ID="AIS" />
<owl:Thing rdf:about="#AIS">
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="#GeospatialAeronauticalInformationServiceProfile"/>
</owl:Thing>






The new class GeospatialAeronauticalInformationServiceProfile extends WSDOM ServiceProfile and gml:Entity which makes it compatible with GeoSPARQL. At the same time, due to the naming convention (AeronauticalInformationService), it corresponds to a category from FAA Service Taxonomies.




There is an Appendix in this report, which provides more examples for an OWL class hierarchy used to model the FAA Service Taxonomies. Only service types used in aeronautical traffic management are considered (for example those of aeronautical information service type).






11.5. SDCM 2.0


The Service Description Conceptual Model (SDCM) [5] provides a graphical and lexical representation of the properties, structure, and interrelationships of service metadata elements. As it has been stated in the specification document, the aim was "to define a conceptual model of a service description based on consistent application of service oriented architecture (SOA) principles and establish adequate and consistent semantics for concepts used in documentation for SOA-based services." The SDCM is a product of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) System Wide Information Management Program (SWIM) and the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research Program (SESAR) Joint Undertaking (SJU).




SDCM is aimed to be used as conceptual fundament for SWIM Common Registry (SCR) [6], as well as for FAA SWIM Registry (NSRR) [15].




SDCM 2.0 conceptual model has many similarities to the WSDOM ontology. SDCM is platform independent (it was designed in UML 2.0). For interoperability, an option would be the to define similarities between SDCM 2.0 concepts and the WSDOM ontology and extend ontology for missing elements:




	
Identify similarities between SDCM and WSDOM;


	
Using OWL extension mechanism to include SDCM conceptual model into WSDOM ontology; and


	
Alternatively, instantiate the SDCM conceptual model as dedicated ontology and use it with WSDOM;







Additional axioms for mediation between service description concepts (SDCM and WSDOM classes and properties) could be provided as extension. In inclusion of axioms would require following activities:




	
Generate SDCM equivalent OWL ontology;


	
Introduce OWL axioms to describe similarities and differences between SDCM and WSDOM concepts;


	
Pick and test a reasoner to derive equivalent service representations; and


	
Perform SPARQL queries considering original and deduced concepts.









11.6. WSDOM Service Ontology and OGC OWS GetCapabilities


11.6.1. Introduction


This clause proposes a method for the semantic representation of OGC-compliant geospatial web services using an equivalent OWL ontology, possibly as part of WSDOM ontology. The method could be used to automatically populate the ontology from the OGC GetCapabilities document and augment the WSDOM metadata with additional information. The goal is to achieve interoperability between WSDOM and OGC GetCapabilities document, avoid metadata inconsistencies and enable flawless semantic discovery of aviation OWS services.




As it has been stated in the OGC Web Service Common Implementation Specification [9] the mandatory GetCapabilities operation allows any client to retrieve metadata about the capabilities provided by any server that implements an OWS interface Implementation Specification. The normal response to the GetCapabilities operation is a Service Metadata document encoded in XML.




Considering the importance of interoperability between OWS and WSDOM metadata representations WSDOM classes and properties could be directly or indirectly mapped to or filled up with concepts and attributes from Service metadata document. In order to implement unsupported metadata elements, the extensions to WDSOM shall be considered. An option would be to work with two independent ontologies (the WSDOM and the GetCapabilities one) but specify the axioms in order to describe similarities and differences.




Interesting work has already been done in describing OGC Geospatial Web Services using OWL-S Web Service Ontologies [10]. The paper provides an analysis of Service Metadata document and presents an OWL-S based ontology, which supports a subset (binding part was not included) of metadata attributes from GetCapabilities for WFS and WMS services.




An OGC discussion document from the same authors [11] has provided an endpoint specification for semantic enabled OGC catalogue services specifying the technical interface  for semantic service discovery. While this engineering report deals with spatial extensions for WSDOM and the interoperability with OWS metadata, it remains for the future to explore how the WSDOM metadata shall be integrated into a service catalogue infrastructure.




The Following diagram created by http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/index.html gives a visualization of the OWL-S extension made to support GetCapabilities documents for WFS and WMS service types. The OWL-S service profile class (which is also available in WSDOM) has been inherited by two dedicated profile classes for WFS and WMS web services. The WMS profile class also contains properties (highlighted), which are not available in original ontology and are supposed to be populated with values from corresponding GetCapabilities document attributes.








Figure 12. OWL-S GetCapabilities extension




For WMS service type following screenshot displays extensions done on OWL-S in order to describe attributes provided by GetCapabilities document. Similar approach might be used to extend the WSDOM ontology for interoperability with GetCapabilities document format.








Figure 13. OWL-S extended for GetCapabilities concepts






11.6.2. GetCapabilities document taxonomy


Section 7.4 of [16] defines Service metadata document contents, which are mandatory for all OGC Web Services.




There is a subset of metadata common to all OWS types (WFS, WMS and WPS), some attributes are specific as defined by particular implementation specification. Following table borrowed from [10] depicts section and common attributes.

And an extension for WFS OWS type could be found here:




http://schemas.opengis.net/wfs/2.0/wfs.xsd






11.6.3. GetCapabilities ontology and interoperability with WSDOM


According to [10] the interoperability between GetCapabilities document and OWL-S OGC ontology was successfully demonstrated, although with certain limitations. Only WFS and WMS services were used. Service grounding was not fully considered for the mapping and according to the report there were many redundant attributes, due to property redundancies inside of OWL-S. WSDOM is however not equal to OWL-S, therefore it could be optimized to avoid such redundancies.




Following table shows more details regarding the mapping between WFS and WMS service metadata and the concepts from an OWL-S OGC ontology created as part of work already mentioned above:

The table provides an overview into the problem complexity. Ontological properties and classes in the most right column are concepts specified in OWL-S OGC ontology. Other elements are members of OWS metadata taxonomy. Recommended solution for mapping specification is to start with platform independent UML model for GetCapabilities taxonomy (if available), generate ontological artifacts and integrate them into the WSDOM ontology. Some concepts, such as Service Provider and Consumer, are obviously already available in WSDOM. Of course, the other required concepts could be directly borrowed from the existing OWL-S OGC ontology. The ontology is available in Appendix C of [10].




For OWL generation a COTS tool with corresponding transformation capabilities should be used. Other approach would be to start with XML Schema (OWS, WFS, WMS etc.) and create an equivalent OWL representation. Once the GetCapability concepts in OWL becomes available, it will be easier to compare them with WSDOM elements and identify similarities and differences.




The major advantage of tooling would be that the code generation tool can be configured to produce not only the ontological representation but also to create a software component, which generates semantic service metadata descriptions based on input GetCapabilities documents. Such semantic outputs could then be used as templates and be manually enriched with advanced semantic concepts.








11.7. Business functions and real world effects


According to STD-065 [8] a business function is a characteristic action or activity that needs to be performed to achieve a desired objective. This section provides several ideas about how to model business functions and real world effects because these two properties are specified in the WSDOM and would be useful for service modeling.




11.7.1. Examples for real world effects


The list below presents some events from the aviation domain, which might occur as consequence of service execution. Therefore, they would be candidates for the Real World Effects taxonomy.




	
Flight delayed


	
Flight postponed


	
Flight cancelled


	
Flight route changed


	
Airport slot reallocated


	
Airport closed, open


	
Airport capacity exceeded


	
Airport capacity changed


	
Runway opened, closed


	
Airspace opened, closed









11.7.2. Real World Effects as Digital NOTAM event types


Real world effects might also (fully or partially) be derived from the Digital NOTAM Event specification 2.0 [4]. This specification provides definitions for 23 events relevant for air traffic management.

	Other Events




Some of events listed above occurs as consequence of business activities, in which case they could be interpreted as real world effects of service execution. All "effects" listed here are related to aviation data types such as AIXM 5.1, GML FIXM, WXXM. Therefore, they are always associated with an OGC compatible data type. For example: An airspace closure shall be performed due to some operational condition. An OWS airspace service  (OGC WFS-T service) will be used to “close” an airspace by updating the corresponding airspace entity (setting corresponding attribute to "CLOSED"). The real world effect would be captured as an "Airspace Closure" event. Of course, certain NOTAM events related to weather phenomena or other circumstances, which usually occur without prior human/system activities are not best candidates to describe the “real world effects.”




The proposal here is to model real world effects using a subset of Digital NOTAM event types and combine them with effects expected from OGC compatible services.






11.7.3. Real World Effects and OWS service restrictions


The OGC OWS services have been designed for provision and processing of geospatial data. They do not cover all possible aviation business cases and are not the best fit for some business functions. Therefore, real world effects with consideration of OGC OWS service endpoints used in aviation (WFS, WMS, WCS and WPS) are mostly limited on the effects like create, read, update and delete:




	
Calculated value returned (WPS);


	
Processed data returned (WPS - document processing/transformation/validation);


	
Data retrieved (WFS, WMS, WCS); and


	
Data set modified (WFS-T).







The WPS services, as the name suggests, are supposed to perform different sorts of geospatial calculations or even business functions with real world effects. In the other cases the effects are focused on data provision (vector or map data) but sometimes (as it has been described above) there could be a broader business meaning even behind a simple update operation. For example, an airspace might be updated and set to be closed using WFS-T, which is an event with more business relevance than the simple airspace entity update. Similar is true for updates affecting other elements of aeronautical infrastructure (airports, runways, navigation aids).








11.8. Examples


In order to better explain the extensions presented, this report provides an Appendix with more service metadata sets and discover query examples. However, a working example would require properly configured and deployed ontology server. To prepare and run an ontology repository would be out of scope of this ER and remains for the future work. Therefore, the appendix section will provide only OWL listings and GeoSPARQL query examples.










12. Semantic tools used for verification



12.1. Introduction


Several ontology servers (triple stores) with GeoSPARQL support were considered in order to test and verify WSDOM with GeoSPARQL and FAA Service Taxonomy extensions. The W3C wiki dedicated to semantic technologies https://www.w3.org/wiki/SparqlImplementations or the http://semwebcentral.org/ contains both collections of commercial and open source solutions that can help in developing GeoSPARQL based semantic service registries. These include complete development environments, editors, libraries and modules for various programming languages.






12.2. Ontology editor


Protege is an ontology editor used to inspect the WSDOM ontology, create extensions and service descriptions and test GeoSPARQL queries. Extensions and service metadata examples were created internally in Protege using graphical editor and exported into the XML/OWL representation before they were loaded in a locale instance of Parliament RDF triple store.

12.3. Service ontology repository


In order to take advantage of geospatial semantic, a service discovery implementation has to understand the GeoSPARQL query syntax and corresponding geospatial ontology extensions. The Parliament™ triple store (http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/) provides such one implementation that allows GeoSPARQL data to be spatially indexed and also contains a query engine that supports GeoSPARQL queries 12. The figure taken from the documentation gives an overview into the layers of Parliament’s modular architecture and highlights the complexity of ontology based data repositories.

13. Conclusion



FAA WSDOM ontology provides the basis for development of semantic service metadata repositories in the aviation domain. In its essence this ontology is not limited to any specific business domain, although it has been created by FAA for aviation purposes and with respect to their service description methods. This section provides several final words regarding service description ontology, extensions and solution stack used for verification.




The WSDOM contains high level service description concepts and shall be enhanced to support geospatial semantic and the classifications used in the aviation domain. It requires more domain specific concepts (classes and properties, metadata instances, geometries, spatial relations) to develop its full potential.




This ER has elaborated several options regarding the new concepts in the WSDOM and proposed an important extension, which is the augmentation with OGC GeoSPARQL to allow geospatial relations and geometries be defined as part of service metadata.




The issue of interoperability between the WSDOM semantic service descriptions and the OWS metadata documents provided by GetCapabilities has been analyzed and an example of GetCapabilities ontology was provided. The consistency between these metadata representations is very important. WSDOM service description must not contain redundant or contradictory informations compared to contents provided by GetCapabilities. The best way to ensure consistency is to specify the mappings, extend the WSDOM ontology if required and begin with getCapability document, whenever a new semantic service description is required.




For mapping of GetCapabilities to an ontological representation, such as WSDOM this ER has analyzed some work already done [10]. The document has described an equivalent GetCapabilities ontology based on OWL-S with some properties and mappings also applicable for the WSDOM ontology.




Service discovery is based on the querying of semantic data. The fact that WSDOM schema has been created with OWL DL actually implies that SPARQL shall be used as the query language of choice. This ER has provided a couple of examples for GeoSPARQL queries, which takes advantage of geospatial properties added to service definitions as part of GeoSPARQL extensions. Using aviation service classification and geospatial attributes it was possible to achieve basic level of service discovery comparable to non semantic service catalogues but with better extensibility (semantic discovery approach based on axioms and reasoning) and better geospatial query expressions.

Appendix C: WSDOM service metadata examples



The semantic service description examples presented here are constructed based on enriched WSDOM ontology and proposed GeoSPARQL geometry extensions. The spatial coordinates used to describe service geometries are based on examples provided in Annex C of GeoSPARQL specification [2]).




All the following examples use the Simple Features relation family and WKT serialization.
