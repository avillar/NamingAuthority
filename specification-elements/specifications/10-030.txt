ISO 19148:2012 specifies a conceptual schema for locations relative to a one-dimensional object as measurement along (and optionally offset from) that object. It defines a description of the data and operations required to use and support linear referencing.


ISO 19148:2012 is applicable to transportation, utilities, location-based services and other applications which define locations relative to linear objects.
