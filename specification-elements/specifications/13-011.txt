What is OWS-9 

OGC is the only international organization that brings industry players together to help 
organizations manage risks and difficulties that relate to communication about real-world location 
and mobility. The OGC combines rapid prototyping, standards development, coordination with 
other standards organizations, and aggressive standards marketing to address users' challenging 
integration problems.  

Over the last 18 years, the OGC's private sector, government and academic members have 
developed a unique and proven process that saves everyone time and money while creating new 
business opportunities and driving innovation. The Interoperability Program plans and conducts 
plugfests, pilots and the annual OGC Web Services (OWS) testbed. 

This report summarizes the results of OGC Web Services Initiative, Phase 9 (OWS-9). OWS-9 
sponsorship totaled $2.80 million USD and attracted an in-kind contribution of 3 times that 
amount. The ten OWS-9 sponsors from the US, Canada and Europe who shared the costs and 
contributed the requirements have missions ranging from environmental management and civil 
government mapping to maintaining common operating pictures in disaster zones and battlefields. 
Working on specific interoperability problems detailed in the sponsors' use cases and scenarios, the 
45 industry participants in OWS-9 have delivered extraordinary value in the following areas: 

 Aviation: The Aviation world gets modern, web-accessible Aeronautical Information Services 
that can adapt as technology changes.  

 Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI): Communities sharing spatial data get a better 
location search capability, improved ability to track data's origins, real-time fusion of data from 
multiple sensors, and a standard for a Global Gazetteer capable of real-time translation of spatial 
semantics. 

 Security and Services Interoperability (SSI): Communities sharing spatial data get 
recommendations for Security Management, a way to automate the creation of implementable 
data schemas from abstract models, easier use of OGC Web Services, methods for more 
efficient design of architectures, and a standard that helps users manage large spatial databases 
that are being edited by intermittently-connected mobile device users. 

 OGC Web Services (OWS) innovations: For everyone, new OGC compliance tests and 
improved interoperability for mobile device apps that use OGC standards in providing location 
services.  



 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium Page 3 

 Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation (CITE): Software implementers now 
have more tests to run against their implementations. Software consumers, especially 
governments who are increasingly favoring solutions that use open international standards, now 
have more mechanisms to guarantee that a software is correctly implementing OGC standards.

Summary of OGC Web Services Initiative, Phase 9 (OWS-9) 

1 Overview 
The OGC Web Services, Phase 9 (OWS-9) Testbed was an initiative of OGC’s Interoperability Program to 
collaboratively extend and demonstrate OGC’s baseline for geospatial interoperability.  The majority of work for 
OWS-9 was conducted from May to December 2012, with the following outcomes:  

 60 Software Components (servers, clients, tools and other applications) were implemented and participated 
in interoperability testing. 

 28 Engineering Reports (ERs) were written.  The OWS-9 ERs were either technical specifications or reports 
regarding testing and analysis. Several CRs were also developed as recommendations for changes to 
existing standards, and have been entered into OGC’s public process for reporting such requests here: 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cr  

 The OWS-9 ERs have also been posted to the OGC Standards Program Pending Documents list for 
consideration in the consensus process. The Engineering reports have been approved for public release, 
accessible on the web here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/per  

 55 organizations participated in some aspect of OWS-9.  Roles for organizations in OWS-9 included 
sponsors, participants and architects.  Additionally there were many organizations that were observers of 
OWS-9. 

 10 sponsoring organizations defined requirements for OWS-9.  The sponsors’ requirements were captured in 
a set of RFQ/CFP documents that were released by OGC seeking organizations that wished to participate in 
OWS-9. 

The OWS-9 Testbed concluded with a well-attended demonstration on Tuesday January 17 during the OGC 
Technical Committee meeting, in Redlands California (check out quick blog about the event at 
www.opengeospatial.org/blog/1775) .The demonstration lasted 2.5 hours and included an overview of the 
testbed and the work areas (threads), as well as quick demonstrations of 3 scenarios (Aviation, SSI/CCI/Mobile 
cross-thread, and geonames). The agenda for the event can be downloaded here 
https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=5175. An exhibit followed the demonstration, where the 
OWS-9 participating organizations had the opportunity to provide in-depth descriptions to their specific 
contributions to OWS-9 to the sponsors and other TC attendees. The feedback about the exhibit from attendees 
and exhibitors alike was very positive.

 Portrayal 
 Temporality Extension 

 

Significant Results Achieved in these work areas:  

 AIRM (to WXXM) Derivation 
o Simple transformation and mapping rules for generating implementation schema from 

the SESAR ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM) were developed. 
o The AIRM was successfully transformed and GML/JSON application schema 

encodings were automatically generated, including code list dictionaries and feature 
catalogues. 

o Existing UML to GML Application Schema (UGAS) software was applied to ensure 
a consistent schema generation result. 

 Data Provision 
o Implemented and tested advanced filtering functionality to: 

§ Selectively retrieve metadata 
§ Have an Event Service provide Digital NOTAMs at a specific update rate 
§ Simplify spatial filtering based upon the spatial extent of AIXM features, 

using AIXM features as geometry operands directly and supporting spatial 
queries of AIXM features that do not provide their spatial context 
themselves (but via other features) 

§ Simplify common filtering tasks through use of the WFS Stored Query 
mechanism and addition of a similar mechanism to the Event Service (Stored 
Filter) 

§ Take into account the actual shape of an airspace – 2.5D instead of 2D only - 
when calculating the spatial relationship (e.g. intersection) to other features 

 Data Transmission Management 
o Concepts from Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) were analyzed, especially the Data 

Management Service (DMS), as well as related technologies. 
o The first version of a modular service specification supporting DMS requirements and 

interoperable DMS systems was defined. 
o DMS prototypes have been implemented and tested – both clients and services. 
o Communication between a client and OGC web services via a DMS was 

demonstrated.  

 Discovery 
o The “Cataloging ISO Metadata (CIM) Registry Package” (an OGC Discussion Paper) 

was implemented and tested. 
o A capability for harvesting ISO compliant service and dataset metadata from a 

number of OGC Web Service types was established. 
o A capability was created for CSW-ebRIM to harvest full OGC WFS metadata. 
o References to OWS-9 Aviation web services were added to the SESAR Registry 

Demonstrator. 
o A “SESAR-compliant” OGC CSW-ebRIM Registry was implemented. 
o A gap analysis between OGC Catalogue Service and SESAR Registry requirements 

was performed. 

 Geometry Processing 
o A number of WPS profiles were developed to serve common Aviation processing 

tasks (intersection of two AIXM features, spatial relationship of AIXM features, 
calculating the geometry of an AIXM feature). 

o WPS components supporting these profiles were implemented as proof of concept. 
o The components were demonstrated based upon real-world use cases (for example the 

intersection of a flight route with airspaces). 



OGC Document 13-011  OWS-9 Summary

 Page 12 

 Metadata Use 
o ISO service metadata (encoded in ISO 19139) was created from OWS Capabilities 

documents (via automated scripts) and made accessible. 
o Metadata guidelines from the OGC Aviation Domain Working Group and NNEW 

were compared, resulting in a number of proposals to enhance and harmonize the 
metadata guidelines and standards. 

o Means to efficiently retrieve metadata from a CSW-ebRIM registry were investigated, 
for example using the proposed CSW-ebRIM 2.0 ‘view’ parameter. 

o A number of metadata transfer options were investigated: via the SOAP message 
header, the SOAP message body, and the dataset payload body (for GML based data). 

 Performance Study 
o A general approach to assess the performance of Aviation data provision services 

(WFS and Event Service) was designed. 
o Test models for a number of (operational) use cases from the Aviation domain were 

developed, implemented, executed against OWS-9 Aviation service components and 
the results documented. 

 Portrayal 
o A workflow to generate ePIB airport maps based upon an OGC standards-based 

architecture was designed, implemented and demonstrated. 
o OGC service components used in the demonstration of the workflow were re-used 

without any modification: 
§ OGC WFS was used to deliver airport feature data relevant for creation of 

the airport maps, 
§ OGC FPS was used for rendering the airport map and the Digital NOTAM 

events 
§ OGC CSW/WRS was used to identify and query the WFS data sources that 

provide relevant feature data and to retrieve styling information 
§ Custom business logic was isolated in an OGC WPS 

o The client to invoke the workflow is portal-based, demonstrating the approach of 
using light wrapper services to mediate OGC services. 

 Temporality Extension 
o The first version of a “Temporality Extension” specification that adds rich query 

functionality to WFS/FES, tailored to the AIXM Temporality Model, was finished. 
The specification can also be used to manage Dynamic Feature Data in general and 
thus is applicable to other domains as well. 

o A prototypical implementation of the service was created and tested. 
o An OGC Discussion Paper was written to document the specification, paving the way 

towards a normative OGC document and thus eventually conformance testing and 
certification. 

Significant results of OWS-9 Aviation (general accomplishments, and encompassing multiple 
work areas): 

 The compliance of OWS-9 Aviation service components with FAA SWIM Compliance 
requirements was analyzed. 

 Multiple AIXM data sets were validated, transformed, corrected and loaded to support testing 
and demonstration. 

 Functionality to simplify the retrieval of AIXM data was designed and tested. 
 Styling information as well as (ISO encoded) dataset and service metadata was harvested, 

transformed and loaded to a CSW-ebRIM Registry to support discovery use cases. 
 The feasibility of performing Aviation processing tasks in a web based fashion via WPS was 

demonstrated. This work can lead to a web based processing toolbox for the Aviation domain. 
 The first version of a DMS specification supporting Data Transmission (to Aircraft) 

Management requirements was created.

 Client software was developed to demonstrate map-centric displays with intuitive user 
interfaces, supporting interactions with OWS-9 Aviation services such as WFS, Event Service 
and DMS. 

 

Significant results regarding the various software components developed in OWS-9 Aviation: 

 
² Web Feature Service 

² Data was loaded, validated, transformed and corrected from multiple sources into 2 
WFSs (one for North America and one for Middle-Northern Europe). 

² WFS query capabilities were exercised to support calculation of airspace extents in 
full 2.5D, including composite airspaces (unions, intersections and subtractions), 
altitude queries including calculation of extents of non-spatial feature types (for 
runways, taxiways and aprons), and spatial filtering of non-spatial feature types. 

² Registry Service 
² The OWS-9 Aviation Registry was used to host resources shared between multiple 

OGC services (e.g. ISO data and service metadata, styling information, etc) 
² The efficient retrieval of metadata was also exercised using the Aviation Registry by 

designing queries to retrieve only the relevant excerpts of the metadata needed by 
client applications.  

² OWS-9 Aviation Web Services were also registered in the SESAR Registry 
Demonstrator.  

² Event Service 
² Compared to the Event Services (ES) used in the previous OGC test beds, major 

improvements have been implemented during OWS-9, particularly features 
supporting Advanced filtering functionality, such as Event Service Update Intervals, 
Stored Filters, AIXM Features as Geometry Operands, Spatial Filtering of Non-
spatial Features, Simple Altitude Queries as well as Selective Metadata Retrieval. 

² Web Processing Service 
² Web Processing Service profiles were implemented to support Electronic Pre-Flight 

Information Briefing (ePIB) generation and geometry processing, including 
calculation of topological relations between two AIXM 5.1 features.  

² Data Management Service 
² OWS-9 Aviation introduced a new component: a Data Management Service (DMS) 

that included a set of functionalities to provide reliable and efficient management of 
communications between aircraft and services located on the ground.  The DMS 
provided: 

² DMS service discovery to find and set the processing options used by the 
DMS to manage communications between the aircraft and dispatch client. 

² DMS basic pass-through, which handled the forwarding of request/response 
and notifications between the aircraft client and OGC web services. 

² Reliable messaging functionality to handle potential communication breaks. 
² Data compression and expansion to improve the use of scarce network / data 

link resources. 
² Data filtering to remove irrelevant data and thus further reduce the size of 

data that needs to be communicated via wireless data links. 
² Dispatch synchronization to ensure that the dispatcher is aware of the 

information the aircraft client received. 
² Provenance tracking to support the aircraft client in identifying the 

provenance (source, potential processing steps, etc) of data received from 
ground services. 

² Validation to support the aircraft client in identifying the validity of 
incoming data and to potentially prevent the delivery of invalid data 
altogether, thus saving network resources.

² Prioritization to expedite the delivery of important information to the 
aircraft.

² Supported the translation of protocols for web services 

² This tool provides the capability to translate service requests between different 
service bindings.  For example if a client (visualization tool) supports only KVP 
bindings but the service to be accessed is a SOAP based service the Façade tool will 
translate the KVP request to a SOAP request.  This would allow access to the data. 
The Façade tool will then convert the response back to KVP so that the client can 
interpret. 

² Implemented WFS Post to SOAP.  
² Released open source code configurable to any service (WMS, WCS, WPS, etc) and 

any protocol (REST, SOAP, KVP, JSON, etc) 
² This tool is intended to support the ability for analysis to discover and make use of 

multiple services that may not have been available to them before thus increasing 
analytic capabilities.
