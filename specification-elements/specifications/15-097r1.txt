                                i. Abstract

This standard defines a conceptual Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) data model. Geospatial User Feedback is metadata that is predominantly produced by the consumers of geospatial data products as they use and gain experience with those products. This standard complements existing metadata conventions whereby documents recording dataset characteristics and production workflows are generated by the creator, publisher or curator of a data product. As a part of metadata, the GUF data model reuses some elements of ISO 19115-1:2014 (the updated version of the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 11) but not the general structure. This selective use of ISO metadata elements prioritizes future interoperability with developing ISO metadata models. This standard is designed to be used combination with an encoding standard. Initially an XML encoding following the ISO 19139 encoding rules is specified in a separate OGC implementation standard (OGC 15-098). In the future other encodings may be defined, including examples such as the use of JSON-LD based on parts of schema.org.

                                iii.          Preface

This standard is based on work done in two European Union 7th Framework program projects called GeoViQua (FP7 FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement n°265178) and CHARMe (FP7/2007-2013 under grant agreement n°312641). GeoViQua considers user feedback as part of the metadata that allows users to assess the quality and fitness-for-use of geospatial datasets. GeoViQua developed its quality model based on ISO 19115-1:2014 and drafts of ISO19157:2013. The GeoViQua model is divided into the Producer Quality Model and the User Feedback Model. Both models are encoded in XML based on the ISO 19139 rules. The GeoViQua User Feedback Model[1] formed the initial basis of the model defined in this standard. CHARMe also focused on developing means for users to annotate datasets. The approach used in that project was based on W3C annotations and developed annotation conventions in RDF. Parts of the CHARMe conceptual model have been incorporated in the OGC GUF standards.

1.             Scope

This OGC® standard defines a data model for encoding user feedback about geospatial datasets or metadata records describing datasets. It reuses and extends the ISO 19115-1:2014 data model. A set of information classes is defined.

This OGC® standard is applicable to metadata catalogue servers and clients that want to exchange geospatial user feedback information.

This OGC® standard is defined to allow implementation of catalogue clients that are able to complement the discovery of geospatial datasets. Catalogue clients present query results, commonly based on summaries of detailed metadata records created and maintained by the producers. Implementation of this standard allows clients to present user feedback summaries and detailed user feedback reports. Clients implementing this standard can provide a user interface to capture use input and comments for datasets or to complement the producer metadata by presenting user feedback information about the data or its metadata.

Geospatial User Feedback as used in this standard encompasses: user comments, questions and answers, user reports of dataset problems and proposed solutions to those problems, ratings, usage reports, citations of related datasets or publications describing usage, quality reports, relevant additional provenance information, and significant events related to the use or interpretation of a dataset.

This standard neither defines an encoding nor a query language to request or send user feedback to catalogues.

2.             Conformance

This standard defines 4 conformance classes.

Requirements for standardization targets are considered:

	 Requirement Quality Common [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/quality-common] has a single conformance class, Quality Common: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/conf/quality-common]. This conformance class targets clients and services implementing quality or user feedback models.
	 Requirement Feedback-item [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/feedback-item] has a single conformance class, Feedback-item: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/conf/ feedback-item]. This conformance class targets clients and services implementing user feedback models.
	 Requirement Feedback-summary [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/feedback-summary] has a single conformance class, Feedback-summary: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/ geospatial-user-feedback /1.0/conf/ feedback-summary]. This conformance class targets clients and services implementing user feedback models.
	 Requirement Feedback-collection [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/feedback-collection] has a single conformance class, Feedback-collection: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/conf/ feedback-collection]. This conformance class targets clients and services implementing user feedback models.


Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site[2].

In order to conform to this OGC® interface standard, a software implementation shall choose to implement:

	 Any encoding extension associated to this standard. Initially an XML encoding following the ISO 19139 encoding rules are provided in a separated standard document (OGC 15-098). A JSON-LD encoding is also foreseen.



All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

5.             Conventions

5.1           Data dictionary tables

The data dictionary for this standard is specified in a series of tables. The contents of the columns in these tables are described in Table 1.

Table : Contents of data dictionary tables	
   Column title

   	
   Column contents

   
	
  Names 

  (left column)

  	
  The name is the UML
  model attribute or association role name. 

  The
  name capitalization rules used are specified in Subclause 11.6.2 of [OGC
  06-121r9]. Some names in the tables may appear to contain spaces, but
  no names contain spaces.

  
	
  Definition 

  (second column)

  	
  Specifies the
  definition of this parameter (omitting unnecessary words such as “a”, “the”,
  and “is”). If the parameter value is the identifier of something, not a
  description or definition, the definition of this parameter should read
  something like “Identifier of ...”.

  
	
  Data type and value
  (third column)

  or

  Data type 

  (if are no second items are included in rows of table)

  	
  Normally contains
  two items:

  The first item is
  often the data type used for this parameter, using data types appropriate in
  a UML model, in which this parameter is a named attribute of a UML class.
  Alternately, the first item can identify the data structure (or class)
  referenced by this association, and references a separate table used to
  specify the contents of that class (or data structure).

  The optional second
  item in the third column of each table should indicate the source of values
  for this parameter, the alternative values, or other value information,
  unless the values are quite clear from other listed information.

  
	
  Multiplicity and use (right or fourth column)

  or

  Multiplicity 

  (if are no second items are included in rows of table)

  	
  Normally contains two items:

  The first item specifies the multiplicity and
  optionality of this parameter in this data structure, either “One
  (mandatory)”, “One or more (mandatory)”, “Zero or one (optional)”, or “Zero
  or more (optional)”.

  The second item in the right column of each table
  specify how any multiplicity other than “One (mandatory)” is used. If that
  parameter is optional, under what condition(s) shall that parameter be
  included or not included?  If that
  parameter can be repeated, for what is that parameter repeated? 

  



 

When the data type used in the third column of such a table, is an enumeration or code list in which all the values are listed, together with the meaning of each value. When this information is extensive, these values and meanings are specified in a separate table that is referenced in the third column of the table row.

The data type of many parameters, in the third table column, is specified as “Character String type, not empty.”

The contents of these data dictionary tables are normative, including any table footnotes.

5.2           UML notation

Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagrams appearing in this standard are used as described in Sub clause 5.2 of OGC Web Service Common [OGC 06-121r9]. Further, the following conventions hold:

	UML elements in white color come from ISO 19115-1:2014 or ISO 19157:2013;
	UML element names with prefix QCM (Quality Common Metadata) are those defined in the http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/quality-common requirements class of this Standard;
	UML element names with prefix GUF (Geospatial User Feedback) are those defined in the http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/feedback-item requirements class of this Standard;
	UML element names with prefix UFS (User Feedback Summary) are those defined in the http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/feedback-summary requirements class of this Standard; and
	UML element names with prefix UFC (User Feedback Collection) are those defined in the http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/1.0/req/feedback-collection requirements class of this Standard.


5.3           Core and Extension Breakdown

The Geospatial User Feedback standard follows the modular specification design pattern as described in OGC 08-131r3. The contributors to this standard decided that the requirements would be split into a core (quality common and geospatial user feedback item) and extensions (for summary statistics and geospatial user feedback collections). In addition, other standards in the GUF series will potentially provide specific encodings of the data model provided in this document. For example, the OGC Geospatial User Feedback Standard [OGC 15-098] XML Encoding Extension is initially provided. Other encodings may be specified in the future (such as a JSON-LD encoding based on parts of schema.org).

6.             Geospatial User Feedback

In addition to metadata provided by the original data provider describing geospatial resources, many users report that they come to trust data based on information about studies performed by their peers. An important element of that trust constitutes not only linking datasets with relevant citations in the scholarly literature, but also a desire for less formal feedback mechanisms such as user comments. As user feedback is a key driver for providers to improve their data products, some data providers have also expressed their desire for a standard such as GUF. (Note that ISO 19115 defines a ‘Citation’ class, but currently this is mainly used to specify a mechanism for citing a dataset, not for linking to external publications about the dataset.). In ISO 19115, the MD_Usage class is a small attempt to address this need, but it appears not to be a suitable or successful means to record user feedback information.

The purpose of providing user feedback is to inform other users and data providers about use cases and experiences using a given geospatial resource. The goal is to collect requirements for data that providers can incorporate into objective quality measures for their products, allowing providers to meet the real needs of users and potentially to find new markets for their data.

The GUF model makes an effort to remain as simple as possible but comprehensive enough, in order to allow for simple user interfaces that can cover different levels of expertise on geospatial data usage. The following are examples of what the GUF model allows: commenting, asking questions, providing answers (the GUF_UserComment class), rating data (GUF_Rating), citing publications (QCM_Publication), providing a quality measure (additionalQuality), documenting additional lineage information (additional LineageSteps), or emphasizing a significant event that conditions the interpretation of a dataset (GUF_SignificantEvent). Each one of the previous examples is considered an “item” of feedback. Feedback items can be arranged in collections and a summary description of the collection is also modeled. Geospatial User Feedback can be provided both about data or metadata.

6.1           Quality Common

This standard reuses elements of the geospatial metadata work and standard defined and maintained by ISO / TC 211. This forms the basis of a data model class list that is common and useful for both quality metadata and user feedback metadata. Some classes have been added to meet the requirements for expressing user feedback.

7.             Geospatial User Feedback model: Core

This section describes two requirements classes that are fundamental for describing Geospatial User Feedback items: the Quality Common and the User Feedback Item.

7.1           Requirements Class Quality Common

This requirements class defines the data model classes that are common to, and useful for, both quality metadata generated by producers as well as user feedback metadata. For this reason, the common data model classes are kept in a separate conformance class. In essence, this conformance class represents the foundation for building a user feedback model. This requirements class inherits the ISO19115-1:2014 and the ISO19157:2013 metadata models (such as CI_Citation, CI_Date, etc) and adds two extra classes for citing publications (QCM_Publications) and for reporting discovery issues (QCM_DiscoveredIssues).

CI_Citation was initially designed to cite geospatial datasets. In the following requirement, we extend this class to make it more suitable for citing publications.


	Req 1   /req/quality-common/citation-of-publications
  
	The implementations of quality common shall follow the UML model as shown in Figure 1 . This model extendes ISO 19115-1:2014 CI_Citation with elements for publications and the specification of the purpose of a citation by adding the properties specified in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4.
 Dependency: ISO19115-1:2014 and ISO19157:2013 data models

ISO 19115 proposes the definition of a MD_Usage to document usages of the geospatial resource. This element has been extended in ISO 19115-1:2014 by adding a new property identifiedIssues which allows reporting of known issues associated with the resource, as well as proposed solutions if available. As a more comprehensive alternative, the GUF standard proposes the following specific class to describe discovered issues of the resource, workarounds and proposed alternatives and solutions.

 


	Req 2   /req/quality-common/discovered-issues
  
	The class QCM_DiscoveredIssue that follows the UML model in Figure 2 with the properties specified in Table 5 shall be used when describing discovered issues in geospatial resources.

7.2           Requirement Class User Feedback Item

This requirements class defines the data model classes that are involved in the definition of an individual user feedback item. A feedback item is the container of the actual feedback. Every item is set into a context by a combination of target, citations and scope.


	Req 3   /req/feedback-item/item
  
	The class GUF_FeedbackItem that follows the UML model in Figure 3 and Figure 4 with the properties specified in Table 6, and other tables referenced in Table 6, shallbe used when describing feedback items relating to geospatial resources.
 Dependency: /req/quality-common

  a     The idea is for a single user to be able to embody more than
  one role, but only one in each item. Thus, a data producer employee may
  comment and normally speak freely as an end user, but may, for example, issue
  a metadata override on behalf of the data provider if s/he explicitly chooses
  that role. S/he would only be allowed to choose roles from his/her user
  information, and maybe there could be additional restrictions. So users
  seeking reliable but "semi-official" metadata could look for
  overrides issued by the provider in that role.

  b    If none of these elements are
  populated, the item does not provide feedback and should be considered empty.

NOTE: This codelist is based on the CHARMe project, which focused primarily on hazards and climatic analysis. (https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/CHAR/Significant+Events). Here, as in other parts of the data model, the codelist approach allows further domain-specific entities to be described and modeled.

7.3           Numeric Codelist for rating

A numeric is a codelist that has a correspondence to a numeric code. This allows for item sorting and numerical calculations such as totals and averages based on the numeric code. Table 18, Table 19 and Table 20 are examples of numeric codelists that can be used for rating.

GUF_RatingCode is intended for implementing a 5 star rating system. This can be used for target resources or for user expertiseLevel. This system is currently used in amazon.com and many other websites.

GUF_ThumbsCode is intended for implementing an “I like” system. GUF_ThumbsCode is expected to be used to give feedback on another feedback item, e.g. to rate the comment of another user about a target resource. This system is currently used in facebook.com “I like” and many other websites.
