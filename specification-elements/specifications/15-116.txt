OGC® O&M AHA profile (Active and Healthy Ageing profile) 
Discussion Paper 

i. Abstract 
This document provides a proposal for a new O&M (Observations and Measurements) 
profile focused on Active and Healthy Ageing, called AHA-ML (Active and Healthy 
Ageing Mark-up Language) an O&M profile - Discussion Paper). This document 
introduces the overall need for such a profile and it discusses the measures which have 
been identified.

iii. Preface 
Increasingly fast aging population is set to challenge health and care systems. Healthcare 
costs are set to increase with the future change in demographics of an aging population. 
In some areas of the world, such as in most European countries, healthcare is the single 
most expensive budget cost (often beyond 60% of total budget). 

By 2060, age distribution in EU27 will change dramatically [2], with average age 
increasing from 40.4 to 47.9 and average life expectancy increasing from 76.7 to 84.6 
(the largest increase planned in the most recent member states). By 2060, life expectancy 
at 65 will increase by 5 years (22.4 years for man and 25.6 for women) and the number of 
persons aged 80+ will triple from 23.7 to 62.4 million (EU27), doubling of the “old-age 
dependency” factor. 

In general terms, the effect of this aging trend will be amplified by a growth in population 
in EU27 countries that will expand until 2035, when it will reach 520.7 million, then to 
decrease to 505 million by 2060 (Eurostat). As a result of such demographics trend, 
public health expenditure in EU27 is set to grow from 7.2% of GDP in 2010 to 8.5% in 
2060, making current healthcare systems difficult to sustain. This situation is clearly 
calling for new care and assistance paradigms. 

This paper shows the first results of the UNCAP project “Ubiquitous iNteroperable Care 
for Ageing People” (www.uncap.eu), funded by the Horizon 2020 programme of the 
European Commission. UNCAP is a pilot-centric innovation action driven by several 
high-tech Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) that, with support from few research centers, 
aims to deliver a suite of innovative ready-to-be-marketed Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) products and services, based on consumer-grade

technologies and open standards, designed to help elderly people with cognitive 
impairments live a more independent life. To facilitate exchange of comprehensive data 
regarding psychophysical conditions, UNCAP has identified a set of measurements 
which have been grouped within a convenient O&M profile.

1 Introduction 

Given the ongoing demographic changes caused by an ageing population, alternative 
approaches to controlling inevitably high healthcare costs should be considered. 
Specifically, work should consider: pressure on pension systems, ageing of the 
workforce, and health and social care needs increases. UNCAP responds to this challenge 
through the development of an open ICT infrastructure that leverages on-location and 
sensor-based technologies to create radically new paradigms for service care delivery. 

UNCAP is delivering a suite of innovative ready-to-be-marketed ICT products and 
services, based on consumer-grade technologies, designed to help elderly people with 
cognitive impairments live a more independent life. The project, which started on January 
2015, will last 3 years and involves 23 partners from 9 countries. The solution that will be 
developed is composed of a cloud platform used to collect, store, and analyze data 
coming from a number of different devices and sensors. Those sensors, most of which are 
wearable or portable, provide a large variety of measurements that have to be shared with 
the server in order to be processed. 

The overall goal of the project is to: 

 Improve effectiveness of the health care processes through more effective 
evaluation processes during the hospital-hospice recovery. 

 Enhance home care treatment and prevention, in order to delay cognitive 
impairment of elderly and possibly postpone the necessity of recovery at 
hospitals or hospices.  

 Support more independent living and improve quality of life and dignity of 
cognitively impaired aging users by helping them be more independent and for 
longer time. 

From a technical standpoint this is being done through fostering of: 

 Openness, through release of open specifications and open software components. 
 Scalability, through use of cloud-centric approaches. 
 User friendliness, ensuring compliance with all most common usability 

standards. 
 Privacy and security, through attention to all related privacy and security 

aspects.  
 Interoperability and use of open standard, through support for a range of open 

standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and beyond (e.g. HL7, 
Open mHealth [3]) for all key services (e.g. position, sensors, building automation 
systems, clinical assessment, storage of clinical data etc.) allowing for future 
extensions in terms of hardware and software.  

Starting from this outlook, UNCAP is proposing the definition of a new profile to extend 
the O&M conceptual model to directly report data related to the Active and Healthy 
Aging domain, thus called AHA-ML. The conceptual model may then be used to define

an XML (or JSON) encoding for the exchange of observations related to this specific 
domain.

4 Why a specific O&M profile for active and healthy aging is needed 

The need for an Active and Healthy Ageing domain-specific profile emerges from the 
requirement to integrate data and information across multiple systems and sensors. There 
is a large variety of data and concepts acquired from bio-sensing technologies which are 
in most cases in a proprietary format. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the concepts 
shared in different applications and aggregate the semantics of commonly used features 
under a single definition. 



OGC 15-116r3

The added value, with respect to other available standards (e.g. Open mHealth [3]), is the 
integration of the geographic information and the possibility – leveraging on SensorML – 
of aggregating the information about the specific sensor used and the description of the 
measurement procedure. 

5 The overall approach 

From the UNCAP project emerged the need to standardize the flow of measurements 
acquired from a large variety of sensors (bio-sensors and other types). 

During the first year of the UNCAP project, we have involved all technologies providers, 
including those that are part of the consortium, in order to address and specifically 
identify the list of measures required by their technologies. To that list other measures 
were added in order to consider the possibility for future integration of new technologies. 

Another input was collected from the pilot sites – addressing nursing homes and home 
care scenarios – by leveraging the use cases collected during the project preparation 
phase, which involved clinical staff from 11 hospitals and nursing homes from 6 different 
European Nations (http://www.uncap.eu/scenarios/). Clinicians and specialists described 
and highlighted a number of requirements to cover their specific needs. Those 
requirements were then translated into use cases reflecting sensors to be adopted and used 
for measurements. An example of what is intended as possible use cases is presented in 
section 7. 

We have then identified for each entry a reference to publicly available vocabularies in 
order to provide a well-defined description of the intended measure. Each vocabulary 
addresses different objectives. Some examples of those that have been selected as 
reference for this work are as follows. 

 Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC): a publicly available 
database specialized on the identification of medical laboratory observations 
(https://loinc.org/). 

 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): a vocabulary that indexes biomedical 
scientific literature such as books and articles (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). 

 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS): a collection of many biomedical 
vocabularies (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/). 

The resulting set of measurements includes 35 entries that are reported in the following 
sections. Each measure will also be related and associated with the geographic location 
where it was collected. 

As per the O&M standard [1], an observation is “an act associated with a discrete time 
instant or period through which a number, term or other symbol is assigned to a 
phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of an identifiable object, which is the feature 
of interest of the observation. The observation uses a procedure, which is often an 
instrument or sensor but may be a process chain, human observer, an algorithm, a 
computation or simulator. The key idea is that the observation result is an estimate of the 



OGC 15-116r3

value of some property of the feature of interest, and the other observation properties 
provide context or metadata to support evaluation, interpretation and use of the result.” 

 

Figure 1: The basic Observation type 

The attributes associated with an observation are as follows. 

 phenomenonTime: describes the time that the result applies to the property of the 
feature-of-interest. This is often the time of interaction by a sampling procedure 
or observation procedure with a real-world feature. In our case it may refer to the 
time a blood sample was collected from the patient. 

 resultTime: describes the time when the result became available, typically when 
the procedure associated with the observation was completed. For some 
observations, this is identical to the phenomenonTime. Following the previous 
example, it reports the time at which the blood sample was analyzed and the value 
of glucose was extracted. 

 validTime: describes the time period during which the result is intended to be 
used. This is an optional attribute. Medical observations often have a period of 
validity after which the doctor requires that a new observation or measurement is 
needed. This identifies the time after which the measurement should be repeated. 
A simple example could be blood pressure or blood glucose levels. 

 parameter: shall describe an arbitrary event-specific parameter. This might be an 
environmental parameter, an instrument setting or input, or an event-specific 



OGC 15-116r3 

Copyright © Open Geospatial Consortium 7 
 

sampling parameter that is not tightly bound to either the feature-of-interest or to 
the observation procedure. In this specific scenario, this attribute can be used to 
define the location where body temperature is measured (e.g., mouth). 

 resultQuality: describes the quality of the result. This instance-specific description 
provides information about the quality of the measurement. This value is strongly 
related with the sensor adopted and the procedure followed during the 
acquisition. 

The procedure used during the observation will be described following the SensorML 
approach. New procedures that adopt different scales for the values or that use different 
technologies for the acquisition process obviously produce different results. Those 
variations should be taken into consideration and made available together with the 
observed value. This document proposes to include this information in the description of 
the sensor according to SensorML. Taking as an example a simple blood test, there is a 
variability that depends on the laboratory conducting the exam (variability due to several 
reasons, the most important of which is the instrumentation used). For this reason, the 
ranges of some measurements (ranges in terms of “normal value”) have not yet been 
defined. Ranges are correlated with the procedure implemented during acquisition and 
the type of technologies that will be used. 

The following figure are depicts the possible interactions with other 
components/standards from OGC for the scenario envisioned: 

 Sensor Observation Service (SOS) to manage and retrieve data and metadata from 
the registered devices by relaying through the O&M standard; 

 Sensor Alert Service (SAS) to be used for the detection of anomalies to send 
alerts to a specific user (e.g. a clinician or next of kin); 

 Sensor Alert Service (SAS) to provide asynchronous notification of sensor events; 
and 

 SensorML to describe the sensor and the measurement process.

The observation uses a procedure, which is often an instrument or sensor but may be a 
human observation in some cases. The observation could be the estimated value of some 
property observed by a human. Observation properties provide context to support 
evaluation, interpretation and use of the result. 

6 The measurements 

This section reports the measures identified as relevant to comprehensively represent the 
psychophysical condition of an elderly person. In general terms, the focus is on those 
measurements required by the sensors/devices that will be integrated in the UNCAP 
platform while considering also further measurements which could be relevant in general 
terms. The following list is therefore non exhaustive and may be extended in the future. 

6.1 Affinity 

Relates to the emotional state related to a degree of affinity detected by the system in the 
performing of a given task (e.g., a cognitive game). There is not a specific normative data 
unit for this measure. Affinity is evaluated during a specific task by an EEG or other 
device(s) able to acquire and extract such information.

7 Possible examples of use 

7.1 Scenario 1 

Giulia, a 71 years old woman, was diagnosed a chronic cardiac disease. The treatment 
plan consists of periodical sampling of blood to determine drug levels and ECG 
monitoring. Each analysis has to be shared with her family doctor and her cardiologist.  

Moreover, her family doctor suggested her to periodically participate in nordic walking 
sessions that the local gym is organizing. Giulia agrees to follow the suggestion and 
brings with her a smartphone which, connected to a chest strap, measures the heart rate 
continuously during the session. The information is complemented with the geographic 
information collected from the GPS module integrated in the smartphone. Giulia shares 
each session with her family doctor and instructor in order for them to monitor her 
progresses and react accordingly to adapt the treatment. 

7.2 Scenario 2 

Luca is a university researcher who is studying the evolution of aging population across 
Europe. He is trying to correlate the costs in the different health care systems with the 
lifestyle and health problems in each country. Out of the many parameters he is interested 
into, there are: 

 Physical activity; 
 Weight; and 
 Sleep quality and duration. 

Through his university, he is able to connect to an exposed service from which he can 
gather those parameters in an anonymized and aggregated manner. Data are collected 
from a vast number of users all across Europe and are shared with Luca in real time. All 
the data gathered are provided to Luca in way that will protect the participants’ privacy.

8 Conclusions and recommendations 

This paper presents the proposal for the definition of an O&M profile specifically 
designed to address Active and Healthy Aging scenarios and it explains the details of the 
envisioned profile. For each measure a definition is given together with a few examples 
of devices that are able to collect such measure. This profile is required to address 
specific scenarios that are otherwise not covered by other standards. 

This document will be submitted to the OGC Health Domain Working Group for further 
actions. 

The technical platform of UNCAP (www.uncap.eu) will ensure full implementation of 
the profile hereby proposed.
