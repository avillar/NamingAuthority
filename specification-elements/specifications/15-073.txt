i. Abstract 
This OGC Engineering Report (ER) describes work done in OGC Testbed 11 to test 
GMLJP2 in terms of defining a  DGIWG GMLJP2 version 1 profile. 

The requirements for a DGIWG profile of GMLJP2 have been documented in the 
DGIWG GMLJP2 version 1 profile. The Imagery WG inside DGIWG has developed a 
filter to map the files produced using the previous GMLJP2 schema into the GMLJP2 
version 2 schema and is about to submit a GMLJP2 2.0 profile to DGIWG. 

The DGIWG implementation of the GMLJP2 profile is based on the OGC GMLJP2 v2 
and other requirements are coming directly from the adoption inside the DGIWG of the 
new OGC GMLJP2 version 2. 

This Testbed 11 activity is a response to the need of harmonization between DGIWG and 
OGC. 

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

ogcdoc, ogc document, GMLJP2, Testbed-11, JPEG2000, GMLCOV, SensorML, Grid, 
Metadata, imagery 

iii. Preface 
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held 
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of 
any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be 
aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this 
document, and to provide supporting documentation. 

iv. Business Value 
The OGC GMLJP2 2.0 standard bridges an interoperability gap between data and 
services. This bridging is done by using GMLCOV [09-146r2]  and includes GML (3.2 
equivalent to ISO 19136) and JPEG2000. Further, GMLJP2 is easily implemented inside 
WFS-T and WCS-T thus making it easier consuming these data in OGC services. 
Moreover SensorML integration has been studied and demonstrated in other ERs in OGC 
Testbed-11. Therefore it will be possible to handle a large variety of imagery 
(georefereanceable) and subsequently to widen the usage of such standard. The inter-
standards coordination managed during this activity demonstrate the feasibility of such 
format. No changes are foreseen for Sensor ML and GMLJP2 v2 but in the future the 
adption of CIS 1.1 could generate a new version of the GMLJP2 or more probably a 
common imagery data model WG.

As JPEG2000 is widely used in many other markets (medical, film industry, etc.. ), this 
could open the door to geo-enabling , or geo positioning geospatial imagery. 

v. Future Work 
Improvements in this test and document are desirable to match the new requirements for 
the geo-refereanceable imagery once this will be defined in the refereanceable coverage 
extension specification. Moreover if new datasets should be made available this test and 
document should be improved.  

NB: Possible future topics: Integration in Geopackage, Annotated Imagery, multiple 
codestreams, video encoding (Motion JPEG2000 based).

Annex A: Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative) 

This annex provides an abstract test suite for GMLJP2 data conforming to the DGIWG 
profile. Some of these tests require that the tester uses software that gives a good 
overview of the content in a JPEG2000 file. Annex I in DGIWG profile refer to software 
that can be used for the abstract test suite. 

The test classes refer to the conformance classes that are described in Annex B of 
reference [1] 

A.1.   Tests 

A.1.1. Georeferenced with GML according to GMLJP2 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the GMLJP2 file is georeferenced with GML 
according to the GMLJP2 standard. 

b) Test method: Inspect that the GML georeference exists at its proper location. 
The required GML structure is labeled “gml.root-instance”. 

c) Reference: OGC 05-047r3 - GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery 
(GMLJP2) Encoding 

d) Test type: Basic 

 

A.1.2. GML code passes XML schema validation 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the GML code referencing the JPEG2000 data is 
valid according to the XML schema that the DGIWG profile provides. This 
validation is capable of catching a number of errors. 

b) Test method: Extract the GML georeference and validate the code with the xml 
schema provided by this profile, DGIWGgmlJP2Profile.xsd, which is 
described by Annex F.2.1. 

c) Reference: DGIWG GMLJP2 Profile, Annex F and A.5 

d) Test type: Basic. 



OGC 15-073r2 

15 
Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

A.1.3. GML code has RectifiedGridCoverage 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the GML code has a feature that is a 
RectifiedGridCoverage. The RectifiedGridCoverage is the only coverage that is 
allowed to be used as a georeference in GMLJP2. 

b) Test method: Inspect the GML reference. There should be a 
RectifiedGridCoverage at following XPath: 
/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:feat
ureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage 

c) Reference: OGC 05-047r3 - GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery 
(GMLJP2) Encoding. An additional description is in this profile (DGIWG 
GMLJP2: D.2.1). 

d) Test type: Basic. 

 

A.1.4. The RectifiedGrid contains all required content 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the RectifiedGrid contains all mandatory attributes 
and elements. 

b) Test method: Inspect the GML reference. Inspect the RectifiedGrid at following 
XPath: 
/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:feat
ureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rectifiedGridDomain/gml:Rectif
iedGrid 
Following elements and attributes should exist: 

Name Type 
limits XML element 

origin XML element 
offsetVector XML element. Two elements are required. 

axisName XML element. Two elements are required. 
srsName XML attribute

c) Reference: OGC 05-047r3 - GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery 
(GMLJP2) Encoding and this profile (DGIWG GMLJP2: D.2.2.1.2). 

d) Test type: Basic. 

 

A.1.5. The number of grid cells is the same as the number of pixels 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the GML grid have the same number of grid cells as 
the raster data it is supposed to describe. The raster is interpreted as a grid. 
That means the RectifiedGrid is a description of the geometric properties of the 
raster. 

b) Test method: Check the actual dimensions of the image. In the GML 
georeference, check the following XPath:  

/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 

featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rectifiedGridDomain 

/gml:RectifiedGrid/gml:limits/gml:GridEnvelope  

where the number of grid cells is given as min- and max-coordinates in a 
coordinate system (width, height) with its origin at the upper left corner. This 
system spans from (0) to (raster dimension size – 1). Verify that this is the 
case.

d) Test type: Basic. 



OGC 15-073r2

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

A.1.6. Coordinate lists in GML, have sufficient number of coordinates 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the GML code has sufficient number of coordinates at 
certain places in the GML georeference. GML uses the XML Schema Language 
type list for allowing more than one coordinate in one element. The XML 
Schema Language doesn’t allow a schema to put any restrictions on the number 
of coordinates when using the list type. This means an XML schema validation 
will not catch that error. Therefore the number of coordinates has to be verified 
manually in the GML code. Typically, there should be at least two coordinates 
in one element, but the gml:Point and the gml:offsetVector could have three 
coordinates in the case of 3D data. 

b) Test method: Check that there are at least two coordinates in the GML code at 
following XPaths: 

a. /gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 
featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rectifiedGridDomain 
/gml:RectifiedGrid/gml:limits/gml:GridEnvelope/gml:low

A.1.7. The RectifiedGrid refers to a reference system 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the reference system is given by the attribute 
srsName in the RectifiedGrid element. 

b) Test method: Inspect that the attribute srsName is used at appropriate place in 
the GML, i.e. the RectifiedGrid. There are a few places where this attribute can 
be used. This profile require that this attribute is used at this location:  

/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection 
/gml:featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml: 
rectifiedGridDomain/gml:RectifiedGrid@srsName

A.1.8. Left-hand order coordinate system is used for WGS84 LL coordinates 

a) Test purpose: This profile prescribes that the axis order for WGS84 LL should 
follow standard practice, i.e., use left-hand order axis (latitude, longitude). This 
test is not applicable for UTM/WGS84, which uses right-hand order axis.

b) Test method: It is not advisable to test this by inspecting the image in GIS 
software, because that might instead highlight the axis handling in the software. 
One important part of the problem is that both types of axis orders are common in 
the software. This profile tries to achieve unification in the handling of axis 
orders, which is in line with the recommendation of GML 3.2.1. Therefore inspect 
the coordinates directly in the GML code at following XPaths: 

a. /gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 
featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rectifiedGridDomain/ 
gml:RectifiedGrid/gml:origin/gml:Point/gml:pos 
While using WGS84-LL, the axis order shall be left-handed. 

b. /gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 
featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rectifiedGridDomain/ 
gml:RectifiedGrid/gml:offsetVector 
While using WGS84-LL, the axis order shall be left-handed.

A.1.9. Image coordinate system gives the coordinates in the correct order 

a) Test purpose: The image coordinates does not follow the same rule as the ground 
coordinates. The image coordinates shall always be given in following order 
(width, height). 

b) Test method: Inspect the coordinates directly in the GML code at following XPath: 
/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 
featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rectifiedGridDomain/ 
gml:RectifiedGrid/gml:limits/gml:GridEnvelope/gml:high 
The axis order shall be given as width and height in that order. This can only be 
inspected in a test case there the image is not square.

A.1.10. Metadata extent is coherent with the GML extent 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the extent information in the metadata is coherent 
with the RectifiedGridCoverage that gives the extent of the GMLJP2 file. 

b) Test method: Inspect the GML reference and the metadata extent information. 
The extent should be the same area. The RectifiedGridCoverage is at following 
Xpath in the GML georeference: 
/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:feat
ureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage 

The metadata extent is at following Xpath: 
/gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentification/

A.1.11. Security classification in metadata 

a) Test purpose: Verify that the security classification is recorded in the metadata. 

b) Test method: Inspect the metadata to see if there is a security classification. 

a. The metadata is embedded at the following XPath:  
/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 
featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:metadataProperty 

b. In the metadata, the security classification is found at following XPath: 
/gmd:MD_Metadata/gmd:identificationInfo/gmd:MD_DataIdentificatio

A.1.12. Security classification in Intellectual property rights box 

a) Test purpose: If the file is classified in a security class more restricted than 
unclassified, the classification shall be recorded in an Intellectual property 
rights box in order to secure that information in case the metadata is lost in 
some way. 

b) Test method: Inspect the ‘jp2i’-box (the Intellectual property rights box). The 
box shall contain an IPR element. The security classification shall be stored at 
following XPath: 

/jp:IPR/jp:IPR_EXPLOITATION/jp:IPR_USE_RESTRICTION 

c) Reference: DGIWG GMLJP2 Profile – C.1.5 

d) Test type: Basic. 

 

A.1.13. References to embedded codestreams and XML instances are valid 

a) Test purpose: The GML code uses GMLJP2 URI addresses to refer to different 
embedded parts of the file. These parts can be either codestreams or XML blocks 
within the gml.data structure. Codestreams are addressed by their order in the file 
beginning with number zero. XML blocks are addressed by their accompanying 
label boxes.

b) Test method: Inspect that existing GMLJP2 URI:s refers to existing parts of the 
file. 

a. One GMLJP2 URI in particular, is essential: 
/gml:FeatureCollection/gml:featureMember/gml:FeatureCollection/gml: 
featureMember/gml:RectifiedGridCoverage/gml:rangeSet/gml:File 
/gml:fileName  
This element refers to the codestream that the GML code is georeferencing. 
This element shall always exist and refer to an existing codestream. 

b. There can be other GMLJP2 URI:s for referring to XML instances, like SVG 
symbols. These will occur in the annotations. This part of the test is only 
required for class A and class XA files.
