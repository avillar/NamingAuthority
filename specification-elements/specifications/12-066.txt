1. Introduction 

Recently a national 3D standard has been established in The Netherlands as a CityGML 
ADE (Van den Brink et al 2012; Stoter et al 2011). This ADE completely integrates 
CityGML with the existing national Information Model for large scale topography (called 
Information Model Geography or ‘IMGeo’). IMGeo is modeled in UML (Unified 
Modeling Language), and contains object definitions for large scale representations of 
roads, water, land use/land cover, bridges, tunnels etc. and their properties, and prescribes 
2D point, curve or surface geometry for all objects. As the new version of IMGeo 
(version 2.0) is completely integrated with CityGML, 2D IMGeo data can be extended 
into 2.5D (i.e. as height surface representation) and 3D (as volumetric representation) 
according to geometric and semantic principles of CityGML. 

In line with the Dutch practice of modeling geo-information in UML the IMGeo 
CityGML ADE is modeled using UML class diagrams. However, the CityGML 
specifications do not provide rules or guidance on modeling an ADE in UML (CityGML 
ADE, 2012). It describes only how an ADE must be modeled in the XML schemas. 

 Based on the lessons learned from developing the CityGML-IMGeo ADE, this paper 
describes how CityGML can be extended for specific applications starting from the UML 
diagrams. A complete description of the CityGML-IMGeo ADE can be found in Van den 
Brink et al (2011). This paper summarizes  the technical modeling, i.e. how the UML 
models of CityGML can be extended to also support the concepts defined in a specific 
domain, and how a GML application schema (OGC 2007) conforming to the CityGML 
ADE rules can be automatically generated from the UML model. Our experiences can 
serve as best practice to standardize the developments of domain specific CityGML 
ADEs in the near future. Firstly, because this process is not standardized yet and, 
secondly, because our approach was established through intensive discussions on 
possible alternatives with the OGC CityGML Working Group, members of the Special 
Interest Group 3D (SIG 3D) and other experts. An important step in this process, has 
been the decision of SIG 3D to adopt our UML modeling approach for ADE’s in March, 
2012. 

The IMGeo standard, in which the approach described in this best practice paper is 
implemented, has been formally approved as a Dutch national standard in February 2012. 
This forms evidence of implementation of this best practice. The IMGeo standard is used 
in the Dutch base registry for large scale topography, part of the  national system of base 
registries for sharing data. Government agencies who are data provider of large scale 
topography are required by law to supply at least their data as defined in the mandatory 
core of IMGeo, and encouraged to supply also any optional data they have. 

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the optimal modeling approach, 
which was selected from several alternatives. Section 3 explains how the selected

modeling approach has been applied to model the CityGML ADE ‘IMGeo 2.0’ and 
Section 4 concludes on findings and topics for further research.

2. APPROACH for modeling CityGML ADEs in UML 

This section presents the selection process of the optimal approach for modeling 
application domain extensions of CityGML in UML. During the development of 
CityGML_IMGeo, intensive discussions took place on possible alternatives for modeling 
the ADE in UML, specifically with the OGC CityGML Working Group, members of the 
Special Interest Group 3D (SIG 3D) and other experts. Some of the alternatives were 
based on having only generic extension placeholders in the UML model, while the 
extension would be described informally in some way outside the model. In other 
alternatives the extension would be described in UML. Most of these alternatives were in 
some degree in conflict with rules of UML, the ISO19109 General Feature model, or the 
modular specification standard of OGC (OGC, 2009).   

After comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives, one alternative was 
selected as the best option for the IMGeo ADE. This approach defines the properties to 
be added in subclasses in the ADE package but suppresses these subclasses from the 
generated XML Schema. 

 An extension subclass is marked as ADE extension in the UML model using a stereotype 
or tagged value. A stereotype is preferred because it makes clear from the UML diagrams 
that the ADE subtype is not mapped to an XML Schema component. Tagged values are 
not always (and usually not) shown in the graphical notation. However, this could be 
viewed as violating the GML encoding rule that stereotypes are used for conceptual 
aspects and tagged values for encoding-related aspects. 

Several disadvantages to this approach were noted by the participants of the discussions. 
1) It is confusing to introduce an ADE subclass of a CityGML type although the ADE 
hooks provide a means to avoid subclassing. The ADE hooks represent a concept of 
attribute substitution, for which there is no standard expression method in UML. In UML, 
using a subclass for extending another class is appropriate.  2) In UML a subclass inherits 
all methods and attributes from its super class, but in this case that is not intended. In 
order to stress this, the generalization relation between subclass and CityGML superclass 
receives a stereotype <<ADE>>. 3) Because in UML the extension is modelled with 
subclasses, it is not possible to create an instance diagram where an object instance is 
shown combining properties from different ADE’s. The only way to show instance data 
is on the XML level. 

These disadvantages notwithstanding, there are several reasons why we have chosen this 
approach. Firstly, conceptually IMGeo is an extension of CityGML and therefore 
defining the IMGeo classes as subclasses of CityGML classes and adding the extra 
properties to these subclasses is appropriate.  Another aspect in favor of this alternative is 
that the use of subclassing is understandable for people with basic knowledge of UML 
class diagrams. This is an important requirement of the IMGeo UML model. Finally, this 
approach conforms to relevant rules of UML, the ISO 19100 series and OGC unlike most 



OGC 12-066

of the alternatives. Finally this approach is the most in line with the current geo-
information modeling approach in the Netherlands. 

The fact that in the XML Schema implementation the subclasses are omitted, is seen as a 
technical implementation choice to allow the combining of properties from different 
ADEs. While this is a valid reason on the technical level, it is not taken to mean that in 
the conceptual UML model subclassing should also be avoided.

3. Modeling IMGeo as CityGML ADE 

This section explains how the selected modeling approach was applied to model the 
CityGML ADE IMGeo 2.0. Although the focus in this section is on realising a CityGML 
ADE for the Dutch information model “IMGeo”, the followed procedure contains 
generalities that can be used to model other ADEs in UML as well. 

3.1. Modeling IMGeo classes as subclasses of CityGML classes 

Since CityGML is only available as xml schema, the first step is to recreate the UML 
model in the modeling tool Enterprise Architect, based on (OGC 2008). In the next step 
all IMGeo classes are modeled as subclasses of CityGML classes. Using the selected 
modeling approach, these subclasses get the same class name as the CityGML class they 
are extending. The stereotype <<ADEElement>>  is assigned to the subclasses. This 
stereotype was proposed by Benner and Haefele during the discussion on the selected 
modeling alternative. This stereotype marks these classes as subtypes that only add 
properties to the CityGML class, and accordingly no XML component for these classes 
will be created in the XML Schema. In addition, the specialization relation with the 
CityGML class is marked with a stereotype <<ADE>>. For documentation purposes, a 
Dutch translation of the subclass name is added as an alias.  

For all CityGML classes which are relevant for IMGeo, a subclass is created, adding at 
least a 2D geometry property to all classes. Figure 1 shows an example in the IMGeo 
ADE of a subclass TunnelPart which contains additional properties compared to the 
equivalent CityGML class (2D geometry and LOD0 geometry properties). The yellow 
classes are classes from the CityGML Tunnel package. The <<ADEElement>> 
TunnelPart is a class defined in the IMGeo ADE package as a subclass of CityGML 
TunnelPart class. The Dutch alias is shown between brackets on the class diagram. 

The  implications of applying this inheritance structure, is that the domain specific 
information model gets the same structure as defined by the CityGML model.

Figure 1: TunnelPart AD Element with 2D geometry 

To identify equivalent concepts that can be modeled via this subclassing method, first a 
conceptual mapping was made between CityGML and the application information model 
IMGeo. These mappings compared the concepts at semantic level, i.e. independent of 
which LOD the concept appears in CityGML. 

Obviously, not for every IMGeo class a 1-to-1 mapping to an equivalent CityGML class 
could be found. For these classes, two solutions are possible. The first option, which is 
preferred and therefore applied as much as possible, remodels the IMGeo concept so that 
an equivalent CityGML class can be found. For IMGeo this is for example done for 
Vegetation that models any vegetation-related concept (in IMGeo 1.0 divided over 
several classes) and  AuxiliaryTrafficArea meant for road segments which are not used 
for traffic,  such as verges (in IMGeo modeled under the classes Road or Land Use).  

If it is not possible to remodel the concept into a CityGML class, CityGML is extended 
with a new class, as a subclass of one of the CityGML classes. Figure 2 shows an 
example in the IMGeo ADE of a class which is not available in CityGML but needed in 
IMGeo. The class ‘OverigeConstructie’ (OtherConstruction) is a class to represent man-
made constructions other than buildings, bridges and tunnels. Examples are water 
management constructs such as pumping plants, locks, and weirs but also wharfs, fences, 
loose-standing walls, high-tension line towers and wind turbines. It is modeled as a 
<<featureType>> subclass of the CityGML class _Site (with a Dutch class name) which 
is not suppressed from the XML Schema. The class has its own properties which are 
modeled similar to CityGML classes, such as implicit geometry on different LODs as 
well as 2D and 3D geometry up to LOD3.

3.2. The use of code lists in the ADE 

CityGML provides code lists to allow predefined values for the CityGML attributes. 
However, the CityGML-IMGeo ADE makes use of national classification code lists 
instead of the CityGML code lists. Several aspects gave reasons to do this (this is in line 
with the findings of Portele 2009): the national lists are specifically suited to the Dutch 
context and contain a definition for each concept, approved by the Dutch organizations 
involved. Other reasons for not using the CityGML code lists are that IMGeo favors 
Dutch language code lists and that the CityGML standard does not provide definitions for 
the code list values, which makes it hard to decide which value to use. There is no need to 
map the Dutch code lists to the CityGML code lists, as these are non-normative and 
software does not check on code list values nor process them in specific ways.  

Both CityGML and GML do not provide a normative way to structure code lists. 
Prominent choices are GML dictionary and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organisation 
System; SKOS, 2012). GML dictionary was considered but not selected, because these 
are deprecated in GML 3.3, while SKOS adoption is growing in the geo community. 
SKOS was therefore selected. 

The code lists are maintained in the UML model and XML structured code lists can be 
generated from the UML using a ShapeChange customization which allows generation of 
SKOS-encoded code lists from UML classes with a <<codeList>> stereotype. The 
disadvantage of maintaining the code lists in the UML model, is that the UML model 
needs to be updated in case the code lists need an update. For IMGeo the code lists are 
considered as part of the standard and allowed to change only when a new IMGeo 
version is published. 



OGC 12-066

The SKOS code lists will be published in a national, publicly available registry, which 
also contains the IMGeo XML Schema. Each code list and code list value is accessible 
via its own URL.  

Code list validation can be done using standard XML techniques such as Schematron 
constraints (ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006(E)). Further work is needed to assess how the IMGeo 
code lists are best represented and structured in SKOS.  

3.3.   Generating XML Schema from the UML ADE 

The Java tool ShapeChange is used to generate an XML Schema (GML application 
schema) from the ADE defined in UML (Portele, 2008). As mentioned before, 
ShapeChange implements the UML to GML encoding rules described in ISO 19136, ISO 
10118, and ISO 19109. ShapeChange was modified to add a custom encoding rule for 
classes with the <<ADEElement>> stereotype. These classes are suppressed from the 
GML Application schema, while their properties are added to the ADE namespace as 
substitutes for the CityGML “_GenericApplicationPropertyOf<Featuretypename>” 
hooks as described in CityGML 10.13.1.   

For the national 3D standard it is required to identify the reference system (x, y, z) to be 
used in the GML files.  

IMGeo 2.0 compliant test data has been generated to show how the model works when 
applied to data, see Figure 3.

4. Conclusion and further research 

This paper presents an approach for automatic generation of a CityGML ADE starting 
from UML schema. After some investigations of the several possibilities,  the most 
beneficial for the Dutch purposes was applied for the CityGML ADE IMGeo (i.e. the 
Dutch national 3D standard). The main principle of the selected approach is that all 
classes of IMGeo are modeled as subclasses of CityGML classes and these subclasses get 
the same class name as the CityGML class they are extending. The stereotype 
<<ADEElement>> marks these classes as subtypes that only add properties to the 
CityGML class, and accordingly no XML component for these classes will be created in 
the XML Schema. 

In the development of CityGML ADE IMGeo 2.0 a number of topics are identified that 
requires further research. Firstly, more research is needed to understand the consequences 
of this new modeling method for IMGeo when used for both 2D and 3D datasets, e.g. 
how to preserve the links between the different LODs and how to upgrade 2D LOD to 
higher LODs. Secondly, knowledge is required on the ability to use 3D IMGeo data in 
CityGML-aware software, i.e. whether software systems are compatible with our 
extensions and which adaption is required. Furthermore research is needed to assess how 
the IMGeo code lists are best represented and structured in SKOS. Finally, the creation 
and management of CityGML-IMGeo data needs more research attention. Which 
methods can be used to generate CityGML-IMGeo data? How should this data be 
validated and maintained? How can 2.5D topology be created and maintained? 

These open issues are currently being studied in a follow-up project of the 3D Pilot NL 
(Stoter et al, 2012). The first phase finished in June, 2011 and has been reported in Stoter 
et al (2011). Since October 2011 over 100 organizations (Geonovum, 2012) are 
contributing to the six activities of the second phase of the 3D Pilot NL. The activities 
related to learn more about the UML modeling approach for ADEs are the generation of 
3D IMGeo example data (several levels of detail and several classes) and the design and 
implementation of a 3D validator that tests whether both the semantics and the geometry 
of the data are compliant with the standard. 

This is the first study on extending the UML diagrams of CityGML for specific domains. 
Since the OGC CityGML specifications do not provide rules or guidance on correctly 
modeling an ADE in UML, this paper may serve as best practice for future ADEs to be 
modeled in UML.
