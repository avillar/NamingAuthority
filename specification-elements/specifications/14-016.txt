Preface 

A significant part of the OGC standards development process is the Interoperability 
Program (IP), which conducts international interoperability initiatives such as Testbeds, 
Pilot Projects, Interoperability Experiments, and Interoperability Expert Services. These 
activities are designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation, demonstration 
and adoption of open, consensus based standards and best practices.  

The OGC Testbed 10 (Testbed-10) is a Testbed within the Interoperability Program.  
Within Testbed-10, The Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) thread seeks to build 
on interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data and advance semantic 
mediation approaches for data discovery, access and use of heterogeneous data models 
and heterogeneous metadata models. This thread explored the creation of domain 
ontologies and tools to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic data provided 
voluntarily by individuals.

1.4 Future work 

Improvements in this document are desirable to the following topics: 

 Additional VGI sources could be explored to further prove the developed concept 
of modeling VGI data as human observations 

 The use of SWE standards for modeling and serving VGI is very promising. 
Further work should be invested in this topic to derive best practice guidelines 
and/or a profile recommending how SWE can be used for VGI.  

 The linking concept could be extended in conjunction with the conflation 
approach (see OGC-14-001) to create rules to decide whether data will be 
conflated or linked

5 Testbed-10 CCI VGI Engineering Report 

This document summarizes the work carried out within Testbed-10 in the field of VGI as 
part of the CCI thread. It provides details on the general service architecture, service 
interfaces as well as on internal workflows developed within this test bed. 

5.1 Integrating VGI with Spatial Data Infrastructures 

VGI has become an important source of information to geographers, authorities, and the 
general public facilitating the understanding of our environment. Of particular 
importance is VGI for supporting the management of emergency and crisis situations. 
Thereby, from a computational perspective, the human can be considered as a sensor 
producing heterogeneous data and contributing to a vast information space of different 
VGI sources (e.g. Twitter, Flickr, and OpenStreetMap). This view of humans as sensors 
has been suggested and investigated by various researchers (e.g. [1], [2]). Our previous 
work (e.g. [3], [4]) supports this view by utilizing OGC’s Sensor Web Enablement 
(SWE) framework to integrate VGI with spatial data infrastructures. 

By building up on the findings for making use of VGI in the OWS-9 test bed (see [OGC 
12-103r3]), we propose to follow the above described view on VGI and to incorporate the 
advantages of the SWE specifications into the overall architecture. As previous work has 
shown, the Sensor Web components are particularly useful for this challenging 
integration task. Using the Observations & Measurements (O&M) data model allows 
transforming the heterogeneous VGI data into a standardized model and format. O&M is 
flexible enough to support various VGI sources. At the same time, O&M is a narrow 
GML application schema and thus ensures a high degree of interoperability.  

Once the data is encoded as O&M, we have paved the road for an interoperable usage in 
OGC service components. VGI data can be collected and provided through the 
standardized Sensor Observation Service (SOS) as well as the Web Feature Service 
(WFS). Using the Sensor Event Service (SES) we can also incorporate real time complex 
event processing on incoming VGI data streams encoded as O&M.  

Once these fundamental services allow an interoperable access to VGI, other required 
services for data linking or rule-based conflation can be plugged into the architecture. 
Encapsulated behind well-defined interfaces (i.e., WPS profiles), similar services as used 
in OWS-9 for ontology look-up (SPARQL), semantic mediation, geoparsing VGI, or 
attribute/feature/dataset conflation can be easily incorporated.

5.2 SOS for VGI 

As described in section 5.1 VGI data can be modeled as observation data collected by 
humans. In order to align the information available in a VGI data source with the O&M 
model, a conceptual mapping has been developed. Figure 1 illustrates this approach. It 
features an additional abstraction layer (in blue), the Human Observer. This way an 
existing VGI data source (e.g. Flickr photos) can be easily mapped against the O&M 
model. 

 

Figure 1 - Example Flickr observation 

Since 52°North has developed a reference implementation of the SOS 2.0 standard, this 
this model has been implemented with the latest 52°North SOS server implementation 
(52°North SOS 4.0). Besides mapping this O&M model to the default data model of the 
52°North SOS a minor enhancement of the GetObservation was necessary: a filter for 
requesting observations (e.g. images) based on their descriptions (e.g. “fire”) was 
introduced.

5.3 WFS for VGI 

However, as the SOS interface was not supported by all clients in the scenario, also the 
52°North SOS was enhanced to also provide a WFS 2.0 service interface. Following this 
approach the WFS for VGI leverages the underlying robust implementation of the SOS 
standard by mapping incoming WFS 2.0 requests to the appropriate SOS 2.0 requests. As 
O&M 2.0 is a GML 3.2.1 Application Schema, the WFS for VGI can simply provide the 
data in the same format as via the SOS 2.0 interface methods. In addition the service has 
been designed to be able to reuse existing functionality such as filtering via keywords or 
spatial extents. The following sections provide an overview on the realized functionality. 

5.3.1 Example Requests 

The WFS for VGI currently supports KVP requests.  

A minimal getFeature request for getting all observations is shown below:

w.opengis.net/om/2.0)&typenames=om:Observation 
 
 
 

5.3.2 Filtering 

Filtering is also supported, for example the can features be filtered by a temporal extent:

5.4 Pattern for Integrating VGI Sources 

This section provides information on how VGI data has been gathered from the Flickr 
platform and integrated into the WFS for VGI instance. 

The figure below shows an example integration of Flickr as a VGI source with spatial 
data infrastructures. Therefore, a new VGI Component serves as an integrator which is 
capable of crawling Flickr for certain photographs. The VGI Component can be triggered 
via its own REST interface, to start the crawling process and to upload metadata about 
photographs to the SOS/WFS. Once uploaded to this service, the data is available from 
there through the standardized interface of the SOS/WFS and encoded as O&M data. 

 

Figure 2 - Example of integrating Flickr with OGC services 

In the following we describe in detail the functionality of the different components 
involved in the integration. 

Please note: A similar approach has also been implemented to harvest tweets from 
Twitter. The implementation approach is identical except that the Twitter API is called 
instead of the Flickr API. Thus, all of the following descriptions also apply to the Twitter 
implementation. 

5.4.1 Invocation of Data Loading 

To inititate data loading / harvesting, a dedicated software component, the Control Center 
Client, was used. This component is the entry point to the integration process. The user 
can utilize this tool to trigger the download of specific Flickr/Twitter metadata which will 
then be made available on the SOS/WFS server. As the VGI Component itself is 
stateless, the client has to keep track of already integrated data. This was realized via 
simple time-based query definitions (see section 5.4.2). 

5.4.2 Data Gathering 

The VGI component is the central component responsible for the interaction with VGI 
sources such as Flickr and Twitter. It offers a REST API to trigger the search for VGI 



OGC 14-016 

12 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

data sets (obserations). The REST API accepts specific parameters (keywords, bbox, and 
time) to search for photographs, e.g.: 

http://<server>/flickrMetaCrawlr/search?keywords=Monterey,Airport&bbox=-140,16,-
100,56&minTime=2008-12-01&maxTime=2013-12-31 

Subsequently, this component uses the Flickr API to find photographs conforming to the 
submitted query. The metadata of those photographs are downloaded and uploaded as 
observations to the SOS/WFS server (see section 5.2). 

This crawling process can be called on demand through the REST interface of the VGI 
component. For example, the FlickrCrawlr can find all Flickr photographs for a specified 
point of interest (POI) and with certain keywords attached (e.g., all Flickr photos in the 
area of “LAX” airport and tagged with the word “fire”). 

The collected VGI data is translated to the O&M model and uploaded to the SOS/WFS 
for VGI using the transactional operations InsertSensor and InsertObservation as defined 
by the SOS standard. Flickr metadata can be uploaded here as O&M. Metadata is made 
available and queryable through the standardized WFS and SOS interfaces. From the 
SOS/WFS, the VGI data is available for display, or further processing. 

5.4.3 Client Integration 

The client accesses the VGI data via the WFS 2.0 interface. It displays the features using 
the shape of the SpatialSamplingFeature enclosed in the O&M Observation. The URL of 
the Flickr image/the Twitter tweet is stored as attribute of the feature. It can be visualized 
in a built-in browser as shown in Figure 3.

5.5 Linking WPS for VGI data 

Linking of VGI data that is described here means the creation of relationships between 
VGI data and geospatial datasets by matching the names or textual descriptions of the 
single features. By the process of VGI data linking the existing datasets can be enriched 
with additional information such as recent images of a feature or recent discussions about 
a feature from social platforms. 

The linking process works as follows: 

1. As the linking process builds upon the conflation process [OGC-14-001] this has 
to be executed first by the client. 

2. The result of the conflation process will be displayed in the client. 

3. The second dataset is loaded from the SOS/WFS for VGI as described in section 
5.2. 

4. The linking process is executed with both datasets and additional parameters. 

5. The feature name/descriptions are matched and the features are ranked. 

6. A table with the ranked matches is returned to the client. 

7. Relationships between features of the two involved datasets can be visualized by 
the client, e.g. by drawing a line.

5.5.1 Implementation 

For the demo scenario the VGI linking process uses a conflated dataset of fire stations in 
the Monterey area and images from Flickr. The matching of the names is performed 
using the FuzzyWuzzy1 software package. The architecture of the involved services is 
depicted in Figure 4. 

 

Figure 4 VGI Linking architecture 

5.5.2 Process inputs 

The linking process requires the following inputs: 

 Source Features: The names of the features will be matched against the target 
features 

 Target Features: The names of the features will be matched against the source 
features 

 Target Description Filter: Target features are only considered, if their description 
(Flickr tags) contain the value of this input

OGC 14-016 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 15 
 

 Search Distance: Distance around a source feature in which target features will be 
considered for matching 

 FuzzyWuzzy Threshold: If the FuzzyWuzzy score of two matched names is above 
this threshold, the respective features are considered a match. 

5.5.3 Process Outputs 

The following output is returned by the process: 

 Matched Features: The client can select, whether the result should be encoded as 
CSV or RDF. 

5.5.4 Example Execute Request

The Source Features are retrieved from a WPS instance. These features are the result of a 
conflation process that has been executed beforehand. The Target Features are loaded 
from the SOS/WFS for VGI. In this example, no filter is applied so that all available 
features are fetched from the SOS/WFS for VGI. The Search Distance has been set to 1 
mile and the threshold for the FuzzyWuzzy software has been set to 70. 

5.5.5 Process Execution 

The process iterates over all source features. The target features are filtered against the 
search distance around the soure feature. Several approaches were tested to find the best 
attributes for performing the matching algorithm.  

As the result, from the conflated dataset the name attribute was chosen.  

The VGI data has several attributes which hold relevant information about the feature. 
For example the description attribute that is used to store the original tags of the 
Flickr image and the name attribute is used to store the original image title. Based on our 
tests with the VGI data we came to the conclusion that the description/tags of the images 
are best suited for the matching process. The use the complete string of tags of the VGI 
data item (e.g. photograph or tweet) and the complete name of the conflated feature did 
not lead to satisfying results2. Even though the FuzzyWuzzy software has built-in 
methods3 to match composite strings, we were not able to retrievet satisfying results 
using these either. In our tests the best method turned out to be splitting the names in 
parts and matching each of the parts against each other using FuzzyWuzzy (see Figure 5). 
The output of the matching is a score value.  

The scores are gathered and the average score is calculated. If the average score is greater 
than the threshold specified by the client, the features are considered as a match. If more 
than one VGI feature is considered as a match, the one with the highest FuzzyWuzzy 
score and the closest proximity to the source feature is chosen. FuzzyWuzzy score, 
distance, both feature IDs and names are stored and returned to the client. 

 

                                                

2 The names in the conflated dataset tend to contain articles and prepositions that are often missing from the 
descriptions/tags of the VGI data. A satisfying result would return a high value (between 70 and 100) even if there are 
words missing in one of the matched strings or if there are spelling errors.

The result values are separated by commas, the first value is the FuzzyWuzzy score, the 
second is the distance in miles. After this the ID of the conflated feature, the ID of the 
matching VGI feature, the name of the conflated feature and the name of the VGI feature 
are shown.  

You can see that the first feature has a high average FuzzyWuzzy score, even though 
there is a spelling error in the tags of the VGI feature.

Here the result is shown in the form of RDF triples. The matching features are 
represented as SimilarityLinks contained in a LinkSet. The FuzzyWuzzy score and the 
distance values are grouped in a ScoreDetails element. There were considerations to 
create an aggregated score out of both values for each SimilarityLink, but this was 
postponed for future work. The wps:score element is a placeholder for the aggregated 
score and is set to null for all SimilarityLinks for the time being.

6 Accomplishments 

Within this work an approach to expose and process VGI data in a standardized way has 
been developed. It was shown how the OGC Sensor Web Enablement Standards are 
suited to handle VGI data sets. In detail, the following results were achieved during the 
activities in the Testbed-10 testbed. 

 Approach for modeling VGI data using the O&M 2.0 model: It has been shown, 
how VGI data can be represented in the O&M 2.0 data model so that it can be 
easily be used within a broad range of applications. 

 Conceptual approach for interoperable provision of VGI data through 
standardized interfaces: This approach describes how the SOS 2.0 interface can be 
used to serve VGI data. In addition, it has been shown, how the integration into 
existing components can be achieved using a WFS layer on top of the SOS 2.0 
interface. 

 Implementation of SOS/WFS instances for VGI: Based on the 52°North SOS, a 
combined SOS/WFS implementation for serving VGI data encoded in O&M 2.0 
was developed. 

 Methods for harvesting VGI data: A simple interface for initiating the harvesting 
of VGI data has been designed and implemented. Furthermore harvesting 
mechanisms for VGI data from Flickr and Twitter were implemented. 

 Conflation process for VGI data for use within a WPS: A process for conflating 
VGI data with other data sets was developed for the 52°North WPS 
implementation. The resulting implementation was successfully tested. This 
process can be used to link VGI data to existing datasets to enrich them with 
additional information in the form of VGI sources such as Flickr images.

7 Lessons Learned 

Our experiments show that mapping VGI data to O&M 2.0 is an excellent way to achieve 
a consistent representation of VGI from different sources and of different types. In some 
cases, it is necessary to define additional fields (e.g. for providing the textual description 
of an image) but O&M offers the necessary means to include such information. Thus, we 
give the recommendation that O&M is well suited to handle VGI data. For the future, it 
would be useful, to advance the results of this reports into a Best Practice Document 
which gives guidance to organizations, users, and organizations that need to deal with the 
interoperable exchange of VGI data. 

Similarly to the use of O&M 2.0 as a data model/encoding, an appropriate interface for 
data access is required. We have experimented with the SOS 2.0 interface and came to 
the conclusion that its well structured set of query parameters offers an excellent basis for 
interoperability accessing VGI resources. Especially, the dedicated query parameters for 
the different observation properties are a significant advantage. Consequently, we also 
recommend including a detailed guidance how to apply the SOS 2.0 interface to VGI into 
a Best Practice Document about the interoperable exchange of VGI data. In addition we 
have shown that a mapping to the VGI SOS to the WFS 2.0 interface is possible. This 
facilitates the integration into existing client software which is not yet able to interact 
with SOS 2.0 servers. 

The number of VGI resources found during the harvesting of Flickr images for the 
demonstration scenario was not very abundant. Few images were georeferenced and the 
image titles and tags were often not very meaningful. These issues also appear on other 
social platforms such as Twitter. We expect that this will further improve in the near 
future as cameras and mobile devices with built-in positioning functionality are getting 
more and more common. However, in the context of Testbed-10, manual processing steps 
had to be executed to prepare the VGI data for its use in the demonstration scenarios. 

The lack of meaningful feature names and descriptions reduced the chances to find 
related VGI data by means of the linking process. The access to the mapped VGI data 
during the WPS linking process worked well.
