Abstract 
CDS Report: Development of Disaster Spatial Data Infrastructures for Disaster 

Resilience 

OGC Disasters Interoperability Concept Development Study (CDS) 
by OGC 

This report presents the results of a concept development study on Disasters 
Interoperability, sponsored by US Geological Survey (USGS) and Federal Geographic 
Data Committee (FGDC), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and executed 
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The focus of this study was to understand 
how to best support the development of, or combination of SDI(s) for the use in 
disasters, to advance the understanding of stakeholder issues, and serve stakeholders’ 
needs. The study included stakeholder engagements, workshops and open Request for 
Information (RFI) that gathered external international positions and opinions on the 
optimal setup and design of an SDI for disasters. The outflow of this report will guide 
a series of interoperability pilots to address priority challenges identified by the 
community in this study. The report follows the format and document of the OGC 
Arctic Spatial Data Pilot; Phase 1 Report: Spatial Data Sharing for the Arctic.  

The report gathered the information from the RFI responses, workshops led by OGC, 
the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction (SDR) a Federal interagency body of the U.S. 
National Science and Technology Council under the Committee on Environment, 
Natural Resources and Sustainability that brought together domain experts.  It 
discusses the various types of stakeholders of an SDI for disasters with their specific 
needs and requirements on aspects such as data sharing, standards & interoperability, 
funding and investment, integration with existing systems, architecture and platform 
as well as security, privacy, and safety. The report further discusses various 
architecture models with a focus on standards required to optimize discovery, usage, 
and processing of data in a highly heterogeneous network of SDI data and service 
providers. The report concludes with several demonstration scenarios that could be 
used in subsequent pilots to demonstrate the value of an SDI for disasters to a broad 
range of stakeholders in different types of disasters. Appendix C provides a summary 
of the two workshops.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Multiple jurisdictions across expansive regions are spending increasing time and 
resources to assist communities and citizens to prepare, respond and recover from major 
disaster events including hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, disease outbreaks, extended 
drought, and wildfires to name a few.  Globally, in the last ten years, there have been an 
average of 370 natural disasters and over 70,000 fatalities a year. In the U.S. alone, the 
cumulative cost of 16 separate billion-dollar weather events was $306.2 billion.2 

To avoid or minimize disaster impacts, effective coordination policies and practices as 
well as the efficient gathering of current and often near real-time data of known quality 
from a range of sources.  Many local, national, and regional jurisdictions have adopted 
common Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) policies and best practices to support the 
sharing and exploitation of important location and condition information, and to support 
rapid adoption of new geoinformation sources and technologies.  However, in many 
cases, as described in the RFI responses, these policies and practices may be 
inconsistently implemented and coordinated which has limited the ability of valuable 
information and tools to be shared and used to address disaster management. 

It was noted that the NSDI has become a critical vehicle for facilitating seamless data 
development, information sharing, and collaborative decision-making across multiple 
sectors of the economy.   

Geospatial information has been proven effective in supporting both the understanding 
of, and response to, disasters. The supported activities include identifying at-risk areas 
by building scientific models and analyzing historical data, assessing damage, and 
coordinating response teams using near real-time data. 

The ability to effectively share, use, and re-use geospatial information and applications 
across and between public and private sector organizations in support of disaster 
preparation, response and resilience is dependent upon having a SDI already in-place 
when disaster strikes. Figure 1.1 presents an example of a U.S. Geospatial CONOPS for 
Disaster preparedness. This CDS and resulting pilots are expected to connect Geospatial 
communities across all operational tiers to bring together requirements for data, tools 
and services required for effective disaster management. Figure 1.2 from Natural 
Resources Canada, below, presents an example that shows the key aspects of an SDI.

Several recurring challenges are common in disaster events. 

• Lack of an integrated policy and operational framework to facilitate rapid 
acceptance, qualification, gestation and use of relevant geospatial information 
from a range of government, commercial providers and citizens. 

• Inability with existing metadata approaches to quickly discover and understand 
which information sources are most useful in the context of a user’s need. 

• Inability to properly fuse and synthesize multiple data sources locally to derive 
knowledge necessary for rapid disaster response decisions. 

• The need for a persistent platform to organize and manage disaster related 
geospatial information and tools necessary for collaborating organizations to 
address the full disaster lifecycle – preparedness, response and recovery. 

Interoperability and open standards are core to any spatial data infrastructure for 
disasters, as they enable the exchange of geospatial data and the use of data in the 



Chapter 1: Introduction 4

processing, visualization, and representation services in distributed systems most 
efficiently. The economic benefits of building systems based on standards has been 
shown in many studies (e.g., DIN 2011).  

The focus of this study was to understand how to best support the development of an 
SDI for disasters and how to make existing implementations i) better known to 
stakeholders, and ii) better in serving the needs of stakeholders. The study included an 
open Request for Information (RFI) with the objective to gather community positions 
and opinions on the optimal setup and design of an SDI for disasters. Responses to this 
RFI and information gathered during two workshops have been integrated into this 
report.  The varied responses to the RFI demonstrate the value of standards in an 
environment that is principally built as a system of systems, i.e., a Disaster Spatial Data 
Infrastructure that integrates a number of existing systems as well as individual services, 
data repositories and near real-time sensor data access. 

The report discusses the various types of stakeholders of an SDI for disasters examining 
their specific needs (Chapter 2) and then examines requirements and constraints on 
aspects such as data sharing, standards and interoperability, funding and investment, 
integration with existing systems, architecture and platform as well as security, privacy, 
and safety (Chapter 3), The report then explores possible SDI architecture models 
(Chapter 4), data, standards and interoperability, including aspects to optimize 
discovery, usage, and processing of data in a highly heterogeneous network of SDI data 
and service providers (Chapter 5). This then leads to an outline of various use cases and 
scenarios that could be used in a series of pilots to demonstrate the value of a Disasters 
SDI to a broad range of stakeholders (Chapter 6).  The report discusses operational and 
organizational requirements and goals (Chapter 7) and concludes with a discussion of 
applications and technologies (Chapter 8) along with other factors received from the 
RFI responses that may be considered when building an effective Disasters SDI  
(Chapter 9). 

1.1 Goals, Sponsors, and Participants of this Initiative 

The Disasters Interoperability CDS is sponsored with a North American focus yet is 
scalable to the entire geospatial community. The project supports the evolution of the 
GeoPlatform, developed by FGDC. To be successful, the Disasters Interoperability 
CDS must take particular requirements into account, including responding to priorities 
of First Responders, working in zero/low bandwidth regions and considering the 
realities of quickly changing circumstances. 



Chapter1.Introduction 5 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

The future follow on pilots that result from the work in the Disasters Interoperability 
CDS will play a key role in addressing a range of complex issues where geospatial data 
are necessary, such as responsible disaster planning, response and recovery, and 
security. Any Disasters SDI aims to make geospatial information available in a 
standardized way to the First Responders, public, academic institutions, the private 
sector, and stakeholders who are involved in conducting disaster response, research, or 
produce value-added products and applications, driving innovation and stimulating 
economic development. Geospatial data, services and applications accessed through the 
GeoPlatform and similar platforms will help agencies understand the lifecycle of 
disasters, facilitating monitoring, management, mitigation, emergency preparedness, 
and decision making. 

Organization managing the RFI 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international consortium of more than 
500 companies, government agencies, research organizations, and universities 
participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geospatial standards. 
OGC standards support interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the Web, wireless and 
location-based services, and mainstream IT. OGC standards empower technology 
developers to make geospatial information and services accessible and useful with any 
application that needs to be geospatially enabled. 

Sponsors 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides the coordinated, comprehensive 
federal response in the event of a terrorist attack, natural disaster or other large-scale 
emergency while working with federal, state, local, and private sector partners to ensure 
a swift and effective recovery effort. 

US Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is an interagency committee that 
promotes the coordinated use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a 
national basis. The FGDC is composed of representatives from 32 Cabinet-level and 
independent Federal agencies. The FGDC is an organized structure of Federal 
geospatial professionals and constituents that provide executive, managerial, and 
advisory direction and oversight for geospatial management and policy across the 
Federal government.   

As the largest water, earth, and biological science and civilian mapping agency of the 
United States, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collects, monitors, and analyzes data 
and information, and provides scientific understanding about natural resource 
conditions, issues, and problems. The diversity of its scientific expertise enables USGS 



Chapter 1: Introduction 6 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

to carry out large-scale, multi-disciplinary investigations and provide impartial 
scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other customers.    

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) AMES Research Center 
and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hosted the two 
Disasters Workshops. Both agencies have provided long term commitment to the Open 
Geospatial Consortium and open standards, as well as supported an open data policy. 

1.2 Disasters SDI Linkages 

There are a number of SDI initiatives addressing disasters, such as the US National 
Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).  

"The NSDI has come to be seen as the technology, policies, criteria, 
standards and people necessary to promote geospatial data sharing 
throughout all levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors, and 
academia. It provides a base or structure of practices and relationships 
among data producers and users that facilitates data sharing and use. It is a 
set of actions and new ways of accessing, sharing and using geographic 
data that enables far more comprehensive analysis of data to help decision-
makers choose the best course(s) of action." FGDC 

The vision of the NSDI is to leverage investments in people, technology, data, and 
procedures to create and provide the geospatial knowledge required to understand, 
protect, and promote national and global interests. 

1.3 Disasters Spatial Data Pilot Activity 

The Disasters Concept Development is the first phase activity that helped capture the 
requirements, gaps and priorities to advance SDIs in the use of disasters. The second 
phase will be a series of OGC pilot initiatives with active involvement of several OGC 
member organizations. 

Both the OGC Concept Development Study and Pilot leverage using OGC’s proven 
Innovation Program rapid prototyping and engineering process. The Innovation 
Program unites technology providers and users in hands on collaborative initiative to 
identify and address significant interoperability challenges.   



Chapter1.Introduction 7 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

The CDS phase develops an overall assessment of geospatial Web services across the 
disaster domain, defines the core components of the National SDI architecture for 
disasters (Disasters SDI), and defines use cases and scenarios for future 
implementations as part of the follow-on pilot phase. These activities were 
complemented by the request for information (RFI) and two workshops to capture the 
various perspectives, requirements, and opinions by disaster stakeholders and 
contributors.  

The goal of the pilot phase is to illustrate and demonstrate the value and usefulness of 
standards-based interoperability in the context of addressing specific challenges 
identified in the CDS phase. This will be done by implementing the recommended 
Disasters SDI architecture and developing a demonstration video that will tell the story 
of the scenario(s) and showcase incorporation of the services into GeoPortal SDI and 
other applications. 



 

 

Chapter 2: Stakeholders 

2.1 Types of Stakeholders 

Through the analysis of the RFI responses and information gathered from Workshops, 
there emerges multiple, orthogonal ways to describe relevant stakeholders in the context 
of a Disasters SDI. The range of stakeholders have been differentiated into five classes 
(See Figure 2.1): End-users, data producers, data providers, data processors, data 
handlers, and policy makers. The classes are not mutually exclusive, and many 
organizations or individuals are members of more than one class. Each class has some 
level of influence on each other, illustrated by the circular arrows connecting the classes. 

The wide class of end-users includes all consumers of products provided by the other 
classes such as data and services, products in the form of reports and statistics, policies 
and regulations, etc. The second class aggregates all data producers or creators, data 
providers, data brokers, and value-added re-sellers. This large group is of particular 
relevance, as it is responsible for one of the main products of the Disasters SDI: the data. 
The third group covers data processors such as GIS, data scientists, data modelers,

addressing the complexity of near or real-time analytics / forecasting geospatial products. 
These experts create products such as analyses, reports, statistics, or maps using data 
provided by the previous group. The fourth group, data handlers is somewhat orthogonal 
to the previous three, and includes the hardware, storage, and computing service 
providers that provide the necessary infrastructure for data exchange and processing. The 
last group, Policy makers, is orthogonal to the ones described before. It lays out the 
necessary rules and guidelines for a successful operation and governance of a Disasters 
SDI.

TABLE 2.1: Abbreviated List of the Disasters SDI Stakeholders 

Many of the organizations included in this long list have been emphasized as particularly 
relevant by respondents to the Disasters CDS RFI. The editors of the Engineering Report 
continue to welcome the involvement and contributions of anyone involved in disaster 
management willing to support the goals and objectives of this pilot. These include a list 
of individuals that can help facilitate contact and engagement of a number of 
organizations as provided in Appendix A.  

 

2.2 Needs of Stakeholders 

From an analysis of the RFI responses, and information discussed and presented at 
workshops, the stakeholder needs relevant to a Disasters SDI can be distilled and 
summarized as follows. 

1. The Disasters SDI should provide stakeholders with appropriate access to the 
spatial data they need.  These data can be static as well as dynamic data that 
arise before, during and after the disaster.  



 Chapter 2: Stakeholders 12 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

2. The Disasters SDI should allow different stakeholders at different locations to 
access the SDI. 

3. The Disasters SDI should allow for data exchange, especially the dynamic data, 
in an appropriate, efficient and secure way. 

These three needs are a simplification of the wide variety of needs facing stakeholders. 
However, keeping these three requirements top-of-mind when during implementation 
will lead to a more effective, useful and dynamic Disasters SDI for all stakeholders.  

A more detailed analysis of stakeholders is described in the remaining sections of this 
chapter and a further examination of stakeholder needs is described in Chapter 3: 
Requirements and Constraints. 

2.3 Analysis of Stakeholders 

The challenge is to manage both the data/analytic contributions, and the data/analytical 
needs of the many organizations responding to a major disaster during a period when an 
overload of new data is pouring into the response community on a minute by minute 
basis. Obviously, preparedness and planning phases are critical to make things work right 
during an incident. The computer and telecommunications infrastructure leveraged 
during a response must be designed to scale up in order to handle the largest imaginable 
disaster loads. 

The engagement of stakeholders and the awareness raising of the Disasters SDI among 
potential stakeholders are key goals of the Disasters Interoperability CDS. First and 
foremost, the best way to get stakeholders involved and well served is to meet their needs. 
This requires making data easy to find, use, and understand. This report covers guidelines 
and experiences from a significant number of disaster data management experts to 
identify the best way to achieve these essential requirements. In addition, ease of use, 
reliability, and completeness, are further dimensions that can be actively pursued. The 
following three subsections identify aspects that need to be addressed in order to improve 
the participation and integration of stakeholders. 

2.3.1 Coordination and Planning of activities 

Coordination of SDI related activities and collaboration among the various organizations 
involved is a critical success factor for a Disasters SDI. A successful shared SDI would 
be a stepping stone to other collaboration activities that could focus on increased data 
collection, introduction of robust monitoring programs and ideally reduced duplication 



 Chapter 2: Stakeholders 13 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

of effort. Fostering early coordination and planning and encouraging transparency within 
the public sector so that collection priorities and data requirements are clearly stated and 
the most efficient approach can be applied ensure that end user needs are met.  

2.3.2 Outreach and Awareness 

Outreach and awareness activities help to attract new stakeholders and to reassure the 
importance of the Disasters SDI among stakeholders already involved or at least aware 
of the relevance of a Disasters SDI. Combined with early coordination activities, outreach 
and awareness activities across stakeholders help to maximize efficiency and 
transparency, which are crucial components leading to acceptance and eventually success 
of a Disasters SDI. The following is a guideline related to outreach activities. 

• Perform outreach activities including social media, story maps, press releases, 
conference presentations, websites, on-line and in-classroom training classes, 
books, etc.  

• Promote the use of crowdsourcing and resultant information in the disaster 
lifecycle. 

• Consider developing a White Paper to guide discussion and comment at both 
ministerial and senior management level across all stakeholders. 

• Improve collaboration between the public and private sectors to share lessons 
learned, establish best practices, and keep abreast of technology advancements. 

• Participate in the trade shows, symposiums, workshops and conferences. 

2.3.3 Technology Ease of Use and Data Availability 

Technology ease of use, coupled with reliability, greatly impacts stakeholder adoption 
rates as well as ensuring users are successful. Thus, the best outreach is probably 
achieved by word of mouth, triggered by an excellent implementation of a Disasters SDI 
serving all stakeholders needs.  

Another aspect that needs to be carefully revisited is the integration of a Disasters SDI 
with existing regional and national Spatial Data Infrastructures, such as US NSDI. 
Further attention shall be given to the integration of data and apps (applications that use 
the data) into widely deployed and used platforms. Simply put, some stakeholders are 
better served by integrating data and apps into the tools they use. For geospatial scientists 
it means being tightly integrated into their GIS; for policy stakeholders it would mean 



 Chapter 2: Stakeholders 14 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

simple story maps, creating dashboard using statistical and geospatial data tied to policy 
questions; and for scientist it would mean integration of datasets with a variety of tools. 
Additionally, stand-alone Disaster Portals must be designed for ease of use and must be 
interoperable with each other and be reliably available and secure. To achieve this level 
of integration, standards defining generic data containers or Web service interfaces for 
easy data access are of overall importance. 

Any successful Disasters SDI needs to take into account the particular disaster situation. 
The SDI needs to find ways to incorporate static knowledge together with dynamic, fast 
changing information. 

 

 





 

 

Chapter 3: Requirements and Constraints 

 

The stakeholder needs discussed in Chapter 2 result in a number of requirements and 
constraints on an optimal Disasters SDI that will be expanded upon in in this chapter. 
Requirements and constraints will be explored in terms of data sharing, standards and 
interoperability, funding and investment, integration with existing systems, agility and 
adaptability, and security, privacy and safety. Figure 3.1 illustrates these categories. 



 Chapter 3: Requirements and Constraints 17 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

 

FIGURE 3.1: High level requirement categories 

The following sections will briefly discuss more details on the various categories to 
ensure a robust baseline for the development of a Disasters SDI architecture and 
operations as discussed in Chapters 4 and 7. 

3.1 Open Data & Data Sharing 

Open Data & Data sharing addresses both legal as well as technical aspects such as how 
to enable data sharing among disparate and heterogeneous endpoints and systems using 
common data models and schemas. Open data is the idea that some data should be freely 
available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from 
copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. Open Data & Data Sharing further 
addresses organizational aspects such as how to encourage data sharing with social or 
economic incentives and enforcement of rules. 

• Any Disasters SDI shall broker both the delivery of government and non-
governmental information or data. 

• Integration of near real-time observations from both satellites and in-situ sensors 
is key. Traditionally, this has not been easily achieved due to the proprietary nature 
of the sensor interfaces. New technologies such as SensorThings API shall be 
implemented. Also, auto-registry of sensors is a key requirement. 



 Chapter 3: Requirements and Constraints 18 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

• The architecture shall support creation and exchange of research-oriented 
synthesized data sets (i.e., simulation model outputs). 

• All data shall be accompanied by metadata. As this requirement is extremely tough 
to implement, new ways shall be explored to minimize the need for manually 
generated metadata. 

3.2 Standards and Interoperability 

Standards and Interoperability addresses mechanisms and agreements to ensure that 
components being part of or that are loosely connected to a Disasters SDI can 
communicate with each other. 

• Interoperability of SDI components across platforms is of overall importance. 

• Data in standardized formats should be served by Web interfaces using 
standardized encodings. 

• Standards-based Web GIS integrates and leverages all the investments that have 
already been made in GIS standards, data, and technologies. Any Disasters SDI 
should benefit from these investments and should be based on Web GIS patterns. 

• Detailed compliance tests shall be available to ensure interoperability across 
components. 

• Unstructured data feeds should be analyzed to determine the best format to enable 
sharing with other users for further process in the disaster workflow. 

3.3 Funding and Investments 

The operation and maintenance of a successful Disasters SDI generates substantial costs 
that need to be covered by funding agencies or invested by companies with the goal to 
generate proportionate profit in the future. In terms of business needs, the following 
aspects need to be considered. 

• Adequate funding from the various organizations; at least initially. 

• Development of relevant applications in the private sector to generate desirable 
return on investment. 



 Chapter 3: Requirements and Constraints 19 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

• Recognition of geospatial data as an investment rather than a cost, which is 
possible through geospatial consortia making the data interoperable between 
different users to be utilized in an interoperable manner. 

• Any Disasters SDI shall consider not only one-time costs associated with 
implementing the solution but the ongoing requirements to support, maintain, and 
enhance the solution over its lifecycle to ensure it continues to deliver value and 
meet stakeholder needs. 

• Individual management objectives, priorities, planning cycles, and investment 
capacity are all constraints that will affect an organizations ability to participate 
in the development of an SDI. 

• Any Disasters SDI shall be prepared for eroding national or organizational 
technical infrastructures. 

• Cost efficiency is key and provided as much as possible out-of-the-box meaning 
using existing cloud hosting and geospatial solutions and without the added 
expense of in-house software development. 

3.4 Integration with existing systems 

Integration with existing systems is a critical aspect to ensure neat integration of data 
hosted in external systems and the protection of investments in other SDIs or platforms 
that shall be conserved. Therefore, the Disasters SDI shall:  

• Coordinate with National Mapping authorities that provide data; 

• Coordinate with international SDIs such as INSPIRE or GEOSS; 

• Integrate with national and regional SDIs such as US NSDI, CGSI, without 
replicating already available resources; 

• Integrate with and support widely deployed geographic information systems 
(GIS); 

• Not be perceived as a competitor to local, regional, or national SDIs; and 

• Integrate data platforms operated by national space agencies or other 
organizations providing satellite-derived data products. 



 Chapter 3: Requirements and Constraints 20

3.5 Architecture and Platforms 

Architecture and Platform aspects play a key role in distributed spatial data collection, 
exploration, and processing environments; and need to ensure that the targeted Disasters 
SDI can keep pace with changing technologies and Internet trends. The following high-
level requirements have been identified. 

• Development efforts for any SDI could be constrained by how prescriptive the 
architectural design is at the outset. To benefit from rapidly improving 
technology, a Disasters SDI needs to remain agile. Architectural decisions affect 
costs to the participants and the ability to benefit as technology changes. Early 
architectural decision can translate into constraints if they are too rigid in their 
approach. Therefore, questions such as these must be addressed:  

o Will the Disasters SDI be a closely architected approach where the 
platform itself consists of the infrastructure, the content, any number of 
APIs and SDKs, and application and content management tools, or 

o Will the Disasters SDI be a loose confederation of portals and platforms 
discoverable by open specifications and standards allowing as-is 
communities to participate, or 

o Will the Disasters SDI be a combination of the two approaches? 

• Multi-linguism and technical language requirements should be considered. 

• Technical knowledge and availability of skills is often a limiting factor in 
stakeholders adopting technical solutions, or in continuing efforts to maintain 
solutions already in place. The architecture has to cater for greatly varying paces 
at which organizations adapt new technology and will have to bridge a wide 
variety of technical solutions of differing ages and platforms. 

• A Disasters SDI shall be very dynamic (in contrast to many other SDIs, that tend 
to be static), because change is occurring at a very high rate. New data sets are 
constantly being added and the huge number of monitoring data sets are updated 
constantly. 

• A Disasters SDI should be also designed for no- or low-bandwidth areas where 
the Internet may not be readily available due to damaged infrastructure from the 
disaster event. Disasters SDI designers must decide if they will provide 
infrastructure as well as data and apps. Examples of using data appliances that are 
loaded with data, software, and apps shall be explored. 



 Chapter 3: Requirements and Constraints 21 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

• Intuitive site structure/navigation with best practices to lower the entry barrier to 
SDIs. 

• Efficient search functionality and fast download rates. 

• The architecture shall allow for future extensions and allow the integration of 
upcoming new patterns to handle e.g., Big Data or semantic annotation. 

3.6 Security, Privacy, Safety 

Security, Privacy and Safety includes aspects such as vulnerability to attacks, acceptance 
and assurance of privacy concerns, secure and reliable access, protection of intellectual 
property rights, and assurance of system availability in critical situations, e.g. emergency 
responses or major crises. Additional items mentioned in RFI responses include the 
following. 

• Many data-sets are access-protected for good reasons (e.g., security 
implications or commercial or government interests). Though these reasons 
are fully acknowledged, SDI design should provide for obtaining information 
about how to access datasets that are not open but may be accessed through 
some other means. For example, industrial stakeholders who procure their 
own data collection programs often are protective of the data set but are 
willing to share them under certain circumstances. The necessary brokering, 
including dealing with protected datasets, must be addressed. 

• Foundational data should be provided as license-free data by the public sector 
during disasters.  

• Individual logins, firewall protection, and a secure server connection capable 
of transferring and storing highly sensitive data need to be available. 



 

 

Chapter 4: Architecture 

The architecture of an SDI is a multi-dimensional concept, including software, hardware, 
deployments, networks, operations, federations and many others. Figure 4.1 identifies 
many aspects that play a role in architecture design and definition. 

 

 

FIGURE 4.1: Architectural Aspects that Need Consideration 

The main goal of this Disasters Interoperability CDS and the follow-on pilots is to 
demonstrate the value of an SDI for Disasters to a broad range of stakeholders. As 
discussed in chapter 2.3.3, one of the best approaches to demonstrate value and increase 
stakeholders’ adoption rates is an excellent implementation of a Disasters SDI serving all 
stakeholders needs. In the simplest terms, as described in section chapter 2, these needs 
were summarized as follows. 

1. The Disasters SDI should provide stakeholders with appropriate access to the 
spatial data they need.  These data can be static as well as dynamic data that arise 
before, during and after the disaster.  

2. The Disasters SDI should allow different stakeholders at different locations to 
access the SDI. 

3. The Disasters SDI should allow for data exchange, especially the dynamic data, in 
an appropriate, efficient and secure way. 

A further discussion of requirements was conducted in Chapter 3 covering areas such as 
open data & data sharing, standards and interoperability, funding and investments, 
integration with existing systems, architecture and platforms, security, privacy, and 
safety. This chapter discusses architecture perspectives and concentrates on a number of 
key aspects to support the future development and extension of any Disasters SDI without 
necessarily being a blueprint ready for implementation. 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 23 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

4.1 Data Infrastructure Evolution 

There is already a considerable data available on the Internet through portals and other 
SDIs that vary considerably in function, scope, capability, and content. Appendix B 
provides an overview of some of these existing data sources. The disaster management 
community and responders to this RFI are well aware that there are many opportunities 
for improvement in how data to be used in disaster management are stored, managed, 
discovered, and delivered to users, and RFI respondents and workshop attendees are 
tending to work collaboratively with, at time, limited resources, to improve the situation. 

The development of disasters SDI is occurring within a context of rapid growth in the 
provision of data and change in user expectations about access to and use of such data. 
The data available, that can be brought to bear on any disaster scenario, is growing in 
volume, velocity, variety, precision, and value. This is increasing the complexity of 
scenarios for data exploitation, as well as the resources required by the communities 
using the data. A number of groups and RFI respondents are developing innovative 
approaches to the creation of data platforms. These approaches share some common 
characteristics, as follow. 

• Individual parameters by themselves are not nearly as valuable as integrated 
data sets. Therefore, the trend is to provide data platform users with access 
to a wide range of data types that they can be exploited together. 

• Data dissemination to first responders can be very challenging due to limited 
bandwidth availability during disaster scenarios.  

• With the explosion of the data that are available, data discovery and analysis 
is becoming increasingly challenging. As a result, the trend is to include 
sophisticated data visualization tools to enable data platform users to easily 
see and understand both the data they can utilize and the results of their 
analysis of that data. Future pilots and perhaps testbeds will need to consider 
recommendations for including artificial intelligence and machine 
learning.   An emphasis for the pilots could be focusing heavily on these 
methodologies, including complex data preprocessing to provide first 
responders with “decision ready” information for use. 

• For any given disaster, much of the data is very dynamic. That is to say that 
the information is changing rapidly and needs to be accessed in near real-
time. 

• The quantity of data available, especially earth observation (EO) data, means 
that it is often not practical for each user to download the data they need to 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 24 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

their local environment. Rather, the trend is to bring the algorithms to the 
data and only download the results of their calculations.  

• Working with large data sets is often computationally intensive. This means 
that modern data platforms need to provide users with highly capable 
information and communication (ICT) technology infrastructure for data 
processing, storage, and networking. 

• The increasing diversity of data sources and the need for operational 
communities to access data unfamiliar to them makes it essential that usable 
data quality information is available for all products.  

• There is an aversion to lock-in with any one technology or supplier. 

4.2 SDI Architecture Concepts 

The ideal Disasters SDI architecture includes many facets that will need to be addressed 
in detail in the next phase of a Disasters CDS Pilot. To avoid restricting the exploration 
activities planned for the pilot, this document will concentrate here on several rather high-
level views on the architecture, including key components of a future ideal SDI 
architecture, knowledge generation views, and technical perspectives demonstrating the 
current state of the art in terms of existing SDI components and installations to reflect 
real world component renewing cycles and operational realities. 

4.2.1 Key Infrastructure Components 

Taking the characteristics discussed in chapter 3.1 into account, it can be summarized 
that modern spatial data platforms are going far beyond traditional data portals by 
combining multiple functionalities and making them available (often in the cloud). The 
components of a modern data platform are shown in Figure 4.2, representing an ideal 
high-level architecture of an integrated Disasters information system for Disaster 
Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. 

This high-level architecture contains the following major components. 

• Community as a Service (CaaS): Collaborative tools for users to publish, 
share and discuss their results, information, data and software/code on the 
platform. Social networking makes a new level of online collaboration 
among communities of practice possible. 

 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 25 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

 

FIGURE 4.2: Components of a modern data platform 

• Data as a Service (DaaS): On-demand data sharing through discovery, 
access, and transportation. Data sets can cover earth observation, air-borne 
and in-situ sensors, as well as other socio-economic data. The emergence of 
service-oriented architecture has rendered the actual platform on which the 
data resides less relevant. 

• Information as a Service (InaaS): The ability to provide standardized and 

secure methods to create, manage, exchange, and extract meaningful 

information from all available data in the right format at the right time. 

• Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivery and management of applications 
and tools by the platform or its users that are used remotely on the platform. 
Provides users with the capability to deploy user-created or acquired 
applications. 

• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The provision of computing resources, 

complemented by storage and networking capabilities, as shared resources, 

scalable on-demand, and enabling cost efficiencies. 

Systems implementing these components integrate a number of functionalities that are 
crucial for modern spatial data infrastructures. Almost all elements are provided by 
services, which allows to serve the full spectrum from raw data access to highly 
customer-tailored products. This approach improves the ease of use for a large group of 
heterogeneous stakeholders using different platforms, including First Responders with 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 26 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

almost no Internet connectivity to scientists with fiber optics and supercomputers, or 
infrastructure novices to data processing experts. They reflect the growing complexity of 
research and analysis situations and provide the necessary communication infrastructure 
to connect distributed stakeholders. They take into account that data cannot be transferred 
to customers in all situations but needs to be processed close to the physical data stores 
to minimize transport issues, which are either caused by limited physical bandwidth or 
by sheer amount of data that needs to be transferred. Cloud technologies support further 
evolvement of the infrastructure as resources can be added on demand. 

4.2.2 Knowledge Chain Perspective 

The first perspective discussed in 4.2.1 above illustrated a high-level future architecture. 
A different position is taken in this chapter to bridge to the technical architecture as it can 
be realistically implemented within the next few years, while at the same time being 
extended step-wise and evolutionary with modern concepts as they reach production level 
maturity. 

From a knowledge generation perspective, an SDI for disasters should ideally consider 
the full data value chain that includes connecting to earth observation and in-situ sensor 
networks, providing mechanisms for storing and hosting data (when hosting is not 
possible at the data source), make the data discoverable and enable use of the data in 
different media and accounting for both online and offline use. From a Disasters SDI, 
content may be disseminated to or retrieved from other global or national networks such 
as GEOSS, United States Geospatial Platform, WMO, and others. This increases 
visibility of the Disaster Management data and information products.  

At the same time, data might be served from storage and server components being part 
of other SDIs or data portal APIs. A large number of data providers, portals and access 
points exist and will remain active in the future and new ones will appear. It is one of the 
goals of a future pilot to demonstrate the value of an SDI as being part of an application 
scenario that involves data registered and served at other SDI or portal API instances. 

4.2.3 Classical SDI Technology Perspective 

When it comes to SDI design reflected in the RFI responses, two important approaches 
must be differentiated. They are not mutually exclusive and a chosen approach can still 
be complemented by the other. In fact, both approaches represent the two extremes of a 
given continuum, with most implementations featuring some level of middle course. 
Nevertheless, the architecture design differs depending on the preferred approach. The 
first approach focuses on the Disasters SDI as a closely architected infrastructure that 
provides data and apps as services. Thus, the defined architecture caters for a defined set 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 27 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

of services (includes rehosted services) that are operated and maintained by an SDI 
control board, i.e., a group with control over the individual components. The second 
approach focuses on infrastructures, platforms, and geoportals as they currently exist and 
emphasizes their integration into a loose confederation. Here, emphasis is on 
discoverability and integration based on open standards. The first puts more control into 
the hands of the control board, whereas the second provides more flexibility and 
distributed responsibilities. Key to both approaches is the strong adherence to standards 
to avoid vendor lock-in with limited flexibility and extensibility. It should be emphasized 
that both approaches can complement each other, i.e., they do not necessarily act in 
isolation, but support interfaces to allow mutual usage. 

 

Closely Architected Approach 

The first, closely architected approach is illustrated in figure 4.3. The platform itself 
consists of the infrastructure, the content, any number of APIs and SDKs, and application 
and content management tools. The actual applications or usually provided as external 
components or as web-based thin clients. Key here is the fact that the entire system 
focuses on the single platform concept, which means that the individual layers and 
implemented aspects are not particular characteristics of the closely architected approach. 
It is the way they are implemented and linked with each other. 

 

FIGURE 4.3: Aspects of an SDI (Source:  Natural Resources Canada) 
Modified) 

 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 28 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The infrastructure includes the hardware and software needed to operate a Disasters 
SDI. The infrastructure design will need to take into consideration the different user 
scenarios, data sources (either managed by the SDI or coming from third party sources), 
appropriateness of cloud technologies, current and future IT policies, and existing hosting 
capacity. The SDI will need to account for offline use situations. To mitigate these, the 
SDI could consider using data appliances, container formats such as GeoPackage, or 
programs such as Geonetcast. 

The content aspect of the Disasters SDI can be broken down into the following. 

• The geospatial data management includes the technologies and workflows for 
managing vector and raster data that will be managed and used in the Disasters 
SDI. Following the best practices defined by the Federal Geographic Data 
Committee (FGDC) for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), the 
Disasters SDI would define the key spatial and nonspatial data layers that support 
the needs of the use cases of the Disasters SDI. For these data layers, data 
management and portfolio management policies and procedures need to be 
defined. This includes but is not limited to data models, data update frequencies, 
conflation of multi-source data, data quality assurance, and availability 
assurances. 

• The real-time data management includes the technologies and workflows for 
ingesting and using real-time data feeds such as sensor feeds, personnel tracking, 
news feeds, and feeds from other systems relevant for the Disasters SDI. 

• Data integration with 3rd-party systems allows to feed or consume data from 
the Disasters SDI. For this, a Web services approach using common service 
interface specifications that build on international standards from the World Wide 
Web Consortium (W3C), the OGC, and others are recommended. 

APIs and SDKs: If data is the fuel of an SDI, Application Programming Interfaces (API) 
and Software Development Kits (SDK) form the engine that powers the applications and 
integration with 3rd-party components. Whatever platform is selected, it needs to offer 
an effective way to create and manage geospatial applications to developers. The offered 
APIs and SDKs shall support building web, mobile, and desktop apps that incorporate 
mapping, visualization, analysis, and more. 

The Application and Content Management component provides the tools and concepts 
that allow for organizing the content in the Disasters SDI in logical and easy to 
understand groups of thematic or organizational structures. Content Management is 
typically done through portals. 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 29 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

Applications: The entire platform will be accessed through a number of applications that 
are tailored to the specific user audiences of the SDI. This component may include map 
applications for viewing, editing, analyzing, and collecting content. The applications may 
vary from templates that are used to tell stories around specific issues Disaster 
Management to advanced desktop GIS that connects to the metadata catalog and 
discovers web services and other content to consume. The important realization is that 
not all users will engage with an SDI for Disaster Management through the portal or 
through the applications managed as part of the SDI.   

 
Loose Confederation Approach 

The second approach is illustrated in Figure 4.4. This approach, shown here with focus 
on service interfaces and encodings, identifies four main components, visualized using 
different background colors. The dark components at the bottom represent data sources 
such as geospatial feature data, geospatial raster data, map, sensor, and other data. This 
data is served by a number of services that belong to different classes, such as data access 
services, processing services, sensor web services, discovery services, or other services. 
These services make use of standardized data models and encodings. Visualization and 
decision support tools and applications make use the data provided by the various 
services in standardized formats. 

 

FIGURE 4.4: Loose confederation approach, source: OGC 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 30 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

This approach concentrates on service interfaces and encodings. It allows an entirely 
decoupled and loosely federated infrastructure with minimized necessary a-priori 
knowledge required to interact with the various components. This approach leaves 
aspects such as maintenance, service configuration etc. to the service operators, i.e., this 
functionality is not part of the architecture view, as it is irrelevant for the actual SDI. This 
contrasts with the closely architected SDI concept, where management tools and content 
tools allow control over more than a single SDI component. The environment illustrated 
here needs to be enriched with security settings, which usually require some sort of 
higher-level organization if features such as single-sign on shall be supported (otherwise 
service consumer would need to register with every service, which works in principle, 
but is not very practical). 

4.2.4 Architecture Requirements 

Independent of the chosen approach, a number of aspects have been repeatedly identified 
as being relevant for a successful SDI. These are usually complemented with the standing 
request for openness as illustrated in figure 4.5. Openness usually refers a number of 
aspects that circle around the fact that an element is openly (in the sense of publicly and 
royalty free) available and reusable, developed in an open process, accessible at 
minimum costs (in terms of data pure reproduction costs or even no costs). 

 

Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination 
accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. Open systems 
includes open source work and Github resources, choices in hardware, operating systems, 
Cloud, databases, developer tools, direct links to non-GIS systems such as CAD and 
BIM, etc.. Open standards include standards as provided by OGC, IHO, ISO TC/211, 
DGIWG, GWG, CGSB, FGDC, OASIS, W3C, ASPRS, etc.) and open specification 

    



 Chapter 4: Architecture 31 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

(widely used but not yet adopted by SDOs openly published technology such as 
GeoJSON, Geoservices REST API, etc.). 

In addition to these general requirements (that are purely stated here, not judged, as it is 
fully acknowledged that some data cannot not be openly available but needs to be 
protected to ensure privacy constraints), an ideal SDI architecture shall allow the 
following. 

• Registry and discovery 

– rapidly discover and access information, products and data. 

– A search mechanism that goes beyond metadata-based key-word search, 
as metadata is never complete and often hard to maintain. 

– Auto-registry for sensors (both remote and in-situ).; 

– Search engines for finding and browsing data, services, and metadata 
which should be adaptable to allow for basic quick searches through 
detailed searches using multiple criteria including: geography, time, 
organization, physical parameter. 

– Users to discover (search), view, assemble and obtain desired data and 
services for a particular area of interest without needing to know the 
details of how the data and services are stored and maintained by 
independent agencies, organizations and data custodians. 

– Non-mapped search results (e.g. technical reports, multimedia) should be 
associated with mapped search results and viewable in the web browser. 

• New functionality and extension 

– Easily publish/reference information, products and data into the SDI. 

– Integration of new functionality. 

– Implementation as a loose confederation of portals and platforms 
discoverable by open specifications and standards. The implementation 
should allow easy integration of upcoming technologies. This is particular 
important as the Disasters SDI needs to allow for restricted bandwidth 
stakeholders.  

– Transparency.  

– A Disasters SDI is by nature federated. It should be as transparent as 
reasonable to an end-user as to where the information being accessed is 
sourced from within the federation. 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 32 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

– Provide illustration and processing of stakeholder data relationships, or 
stakeholder-processing relationships, which could provide valuable 
insight for other stakeholders with similar requirements, as process could 
be copied or adapted more easily. Consideration could be given to adding 
an online information network with an ontology-based interface on top to 
visualize databases and information sources content. This ontology-based 
approach would allow for efficient searches once all data and operation 
concepts are annotated.  

• Low bandwidth and offline usage 

– Support for both online and offline use. 

– Support for low cost mobile devices, such as Android tablets, in the field for 
monitoring, gathering and updating data in areas that have no, or poor data 
communications, using Bluetooth and standards such as GeoPackage.  

– Support for proxies that optimize data for transport over limited bandwidth 
connections or other specific purpose tools. 

– Publishing of large datasets in very efficient ways to support low bandwidth 
situations. 

– Transferring of data via non-internet mechanisms, such as shipping hard 
drives to customers with very limited internet connectivity. These hard drive 
deployed datasets shall be made available as being directly served from a 
standards-based Web service, i.e. data storage is transparent to the end user. 
At least end user experiences shall differ minimally. 

– Downloading datasets in standard formats. 

• External systems and formats 

– Disseminating of metadata and geospatial content to other global or national 
networks such as the Group on Earth Observations, United States Geospatial 
Platform, and others. This increases visibility of the Disasters SDI data and 
information products. 

– Providing connectivity to legacy/heritage systems. 

– Support for scanned hardcopy documents that provide valuable historic data 
sets, including maps, forms, other tabular data (both machine and hand-
written), or hand-drawn sketches. 

– Support for documentary videos, oral histories, and other sources beyond 
purely numerical data. 



 Chapter 4: Architecture 33 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

– Enabling e-visualization of information in a geospatial, data analysis 
presentation environment and temporal context. 

• Tailoring 

– Support both the desktop and mobile environments. 

– Support multi-linguism and appropriate character sets. 

– Support targeted users from a diversity of backgrounds. The efficacy of the 
portal to accessing information by the uninitiated, the man-of-the-street has 
been proven is key to a successful, i.e., well-used SDI. 

• Key service functionality 

– Mapping interface showing search results. Map should be interactive: 
pannable, zoomable, changeable projection. Mapped items should be 
interactive: obtain metadata by clicking/hovering, get data values by 
clicking/hovering. 

– Basic analysis and visualization tools, e.g., navigating long timeseries, 
statistical analysis on selected data sets or subsets. 

 



 

 

Chapter 5: Data 

 

The Disasters Management community provides a unique environment when it comes to 
data acquisition and management.  

This chapter addresses the data required for an effective Disasters SDI. In Section 5.1 
data standards are examined. Data standards was a consistent priority within the RFI 
responses. Section 5.2 looks at data requirements. What data did respondents feel were 
necessary for an effective Disasters SDI. 

Finally, a third section addresses data sets that are available from the responders to the 
RFI. This part can only highlight a number of data sets that are ideally available at 
standardized interfaces. A more complete inventory of available data sets shall be 
developed during this project, with catalog services being used as service and data 
registries that become integral part of the planned demonstrations. 

5.1 Standards 

Standards are one of the key pillars of any SDI. They are key for the quality and 
development of interoperable geographic information and geospatial software during the 
entire life cycle of any data set. Standards define how data is created, archived, used, and 
discovered at and exchanged between components. They address different levels of 
interoperability such as syntax, semantics, services, profiles, or cultural and 



 Chapter 5: Data 35 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

organizational interoperability. There are excellent publications available discussing the 
value of standards and role of standards in geospatial information management 
(OGC/ISO TC211/IHO, 2014) or the usage of standards in SDIs (United Nations, 2013). 
This report will concentrate here on experiences made by the SDI developers and users 
community and refer to external literature for further details on the various standards. A 
good starting point to learn more about important standards is the website of the OGC. 

An approach often used by cookbooks is to classify standards in the context of SDI 
following three categories as introduced by GPC Group. 

• Data Content Standards For understanding the contents of different data 

themes by providing a data model of spatial features, attributes, relationships, 

and a data dictionary. 

• Data Management Standards For handling spatial data involving actions 
such as discovery of data through metadata, spatial referencing of data, 
collection of data from the field, submission of data by contractors to 
stakeholders, and tiling of image-based maps. 

• Data Portrayal Standards For visual portrayal of spatial data using 
cartographic feature symbology. 

This approach is often used by the various cookbooks that exist for the development and 
operation of an SDI (New Zealand Geospatial Office, 2011; United Nations, 2013). Here, 
a different approach and the report discusses standards depending on their functionality 
domain, i.e., data format & access standards, metadata and catalogs, geodata integration, 
and orthogonal standards. 

5.1.1 Data Format & Access Standards 

Many in the disaster management community has adopted OGC standards. However, 
there were organizations responding to the RFI that were continuing to use proprietary 
systems. Most of the respondents use OGC standards to make data and maps available 
for inclusion in external sites and applications. Additionally, many organizations have 
been instructed to use OGC standards when available and develop best practices for 
implementation of the standards. The use of OGC standards will include resource 
catalogues, processing service execution, processing service packaging, and processing 
containers. The major challenge in developing increased usage of the OGC approach will 
be in community building, adequate support (e.g., cookbooks and, easily deployed 
stacks), and a clear value proposition. The focus should be on mature OGC standards that 



 Chapter 5: Data 36 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

are core OGC services: GML, JSON, GeoJSON, WMS, WMTS, WCS, WFS, WPS, SOS, 
and CSW. 

The Disasters SDI pilot will provide an excellent laboratory environment to experiment 
with new, less mature standards in conjunction with established technology. 

Examples of standards that may be further explored as part of the pilot are provided 
below. 

• KML: KML is a file format used to display geographic data in an Earth 
browser such as Google Earth. 

• GeoPackage: GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, 
portable, self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information. 
Since a GeoPackage is a database, it supports direct use, meaning that its data 
can be accessed and updated in a "native" storage format without intermediate 
format translations. GeoPackages are interoperable across all enterprise and 
personal computing environments and are particularly useful on mobile devices 
like cell phones and tablets in communications environments with limited 
connectivity and bandwidth. 

• SensorThings API: SensorThings API provides an open, geospatial-enabled, 
unified and simple way to interconnect the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, 
sensors, data, and applications over the Web. It provides a standard way to 
manage and retrieve observations and metadata from heterogeneous sensor 
systems. 

• AIXM: Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM): AIXM enables the 
provision, in digital format, of the aeronautical information that is in the scope of 
Aeronautical Information Services (AIS). It takes advantages of established 
information engineering standards and supports current and future aeronautical 
information system requirements. 

5.1.2 Metadata and Catalogs 

Many catalogs and registries make use of OGC Services and their corresponding ISO 
TC211 documents.  

It is recommended that metadata follow the ISO 19115 (Geographic Information - 
Metadata) and corresponding ISO 19139 (Geographic Information - Metadata XML 
schema implementation), or their respective profiles, CSDGM (FGDC Content Standard 
for Geospatial Metadata), the Dublin Core, or INSPIRE guidelines and implementation 



 Chapter 5: Data 37 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

rules. In addition, the emerging DCAT standard may be analyzed in more detail for its 
applicability in SDIs. 

One issue that has been reported is today’s focus of spatial data infrastructure metadata 
standards, which are suitable for business-to-business integration, but not suitable for 
consumption by ordinary citizens (e.g., elementary school students). There is a need to 
develop standards which make maps and spatial data suitable for re-use by citizens of 
limited experience and resources. Communities such as the W3C Maps for the HTML 
community have the objective to develop the concepts, software and community 
associated to the needs of developing a standard for maps suitable for adoption by 
browsers, and thereby for citizens who produce and consume HTML. As such, a 
Disasters Pilot would serve as an excellent initiative which could help stimulate 
development of the standards and software of Map Markup Language (MapML) and the 
<web-map>/<MAP> element; an idea that could be experimented with as part of a pilot. 

5.1.3 Geodata Integration 

Combining multiple sources of geospatial information - a necessary key step in the 
geospatial knowledge generation cycle or geospatial data integration in near real-time - 
is still a challenge if it comes to high volumes of data or extremely high update 
frequencies. A solution can only be achieved through the conversion of traditional data 
archives into standardized data architectures that support parallel processing in 
distributed and/or high-performance computing environments as well as complex stream 
processing. A common framework is required that will link very large multi-resolution 
and multi-domain datasets together and to enable the next generation of analytic 
processes to be applied. A solution must be capable of handling multiple data streams 
rather than being explicitly linked to a sensor or data type. 

One successful approach for integration of data is using a discrete global grid system 
(DGGS). A DGGS is a form of Earth reference that, unlike its established counterpart the 
coordinate reference system that represents the Earth as a continual lattice of points, 
represents the Earth with a tessellation of nested cells [6]. Generally, a DGGS will 
exhaustively partition the globe in closely packed hierarchical tessellations, each cell 
representing a homogenous value, with a unique identifier or indexing that allows for 
linear ordering, parent-child operations, and nearest neighbor algebraic operations. 
Further experiments with DGGS and service support should be part of this pilot to gain 
new insights into large data volumes processing and integration.

FIGURE 5.1.: Discrete Global Grid System, source: OGC 

5.1.4 Complementary Standards 

There are a number of complementary standards that may play a role in SDI setup and 
operation and should be explored further as part of this pilot, for example ISO 27001 
(Information Security) and ISO 20000 (IT Service Management). 

5.2 Data Requirements 

A Disasters SDI will play an important role in decision-making in all aspects of disaster 
management. This is a multidisciplinary activity and a spatial data infrastructure is 
expected to facilitate and coordinate the exchange and sharing of static and dynamic 
spatial data between all stakeholders.  

There are several general requirements that apply to many data types, such as real-time 
data availability, integration of local, on-the-scene knowledge with physical 
environmental data, or data quality, coverage and resolution. Based on an analysis of the 
RFI responses, datasets for the following key data categories have been identified to be 
required within an effective Disasters SDI at minimum. Some of the categories tend to 
be cross cutting, meaning that they may use data from other categories within the list. 
This is not an exhaustive list and is in no particular order. 



 Chapter 5: Data 39 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

• Earth Observation: These data category includes satellite and airborne 
collected multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, radar data, airborne and 
surface collected LiDAR data, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery 
and derivatives. 

• Topographic: This data category includes standard GIS layers such as Roads, 
Buildings, Elevation (including Digital Elevation Models), Terrain, Basic 
Landuse/Landcover (water, rivers, soil, man-made, vegetation), Flood Plains, 
near shore bathymetry, etc. 

• Critical Infrastructure: This data category includes road networks, dams and 
reservoirs, power plants, power distribution, oil pipelines, etc.  

• Land Use: This data category includes data property and address, land use, 
geology, land stability, etc. 

• Demographic and Socioeconomic: This data category includes population 
location, density, demographic characteristics, and cultural and heritage assets 
etc. These data sets are useful for assessing disaster vulnerability, potential 
communication demand during disasters, response time for disaster services, 
prioritization of mitigation and response efforts.    

• Meteorological: This data category includes wind velocity and direction, air 
temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, as well as, climate 
parameters and indices. Observations (synoptical measurement, as well as 
remote sensing such as radar) are vital to assess the current state.  Forecasts are 
used in planning an appropriate response. 

• Real-time Sensor Data: This data category includes data received in real time 
from available sensor systems such as direct data devices, audio sensors, video 
cameras and CBRN sensors.  

• Crowd-Sourced Data: Advances in technologies and communications, 
coupled with the rapid rise and adoption of the social media applications have 
created a new category of data for emergency and disaster response systems. 
This has now enabled citizens to generate real-time, georeferenced data that 
may be useful within a Disasters SDI. 

• Disaster Prediction and Planning: This data category includes data such as 
flood predictions, flood depth grid data, seismic site conditions, hurricane 



 Chapter 5: Data 40 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

predictions, etc. This category may also include vulnerability models, 
structures, and social vulnerability. 

It was stated in many responses that, in general, all data should be available in, or 
transformable to, different projections using different datums for efficient map 
productions or integrated processing and analysis operations. It was also stated that the 
use of Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) WGS84, though often used in Web applications, 
has some serious precision implications and should be used with caution in applications 
that have FIPS Moderate or High categorizations. 

5.3 Data Identified in RFI Responses 

Despite the very long list of data categories and types, quite a number of data sets are 
available. Appendix A provides an overview of data sets that have been identified in RFI 
responses, and Workshops. In addition, there is a list of data portals online (see Appendix 
B for details).  

 



 

 

Chapter 6: Scenarios and Use Cases 

 

The goal of this study is to identify requirements and use cases to drive follow on pilots 
that address these requirements and use cases. It has been agreed that this could best be 
done by the implementation and description of a number of use cases and scenarios that 
make use of a number of data sets discovered and served by the Disasters SDI and 
visualized by Disasters SDI client components. The following overview is intended as a 
starting point for the Pilot. 

6.1  Exercise the Life Cycle 

Many of the RFI responses stated that scenarios should not only include disaster response 
situations, but also the current state of data and product exchange practices and 
technologies throughout the disaster life cycle, including disaster planning, response, and 
recovery.   

It was noted that pilot activities could include multi-hazard risk management decision 
making and projections to assess the implications of climate change on future disaster 
risk 

In multi-hazard risk management decision making, it is necessary to combine spatial data 
for multiple natural and technological hazards with appropriate exposure and 
vulnerability data. The integration of data will help compare risks and assess potential 
interactions (e.g., Fukishima-type risks resulting from a natural hazard event). 



 Chapter 6: Scenarios and Use Cases 42 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Another pilot activity is to provide predictive model-based projections to assess the 
implications of future disaster risk and adaptation options.  

Response scenarios should include at least one use-case involving both public and private 
sector entities sharing disaster impact, response, and recovery data to support more 
effective and timely coordination during the response and recovery phases. 

6.2  Disaster Scenario Planning for Future Pilots 

A review of responses indicates that Hurricanes, Earthquakes, Floods and Wildfires 
were, by far, the most popular scenarios that respondents would like to see as a scenario. 
A variety of other disaster scenarios were proposed related to single events and multiple 
event triggers and responses.   

 



 Chapter 6: Scenarios and Use Cases 43 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

 

6.3 Other Scenario Aspects 

There are a number of aspects that are independent on the specific scenario. Instead, they 
are applicable to almost all scenarios. One very important aspect in this context is the 
reality of dealing with low to no Internet bandwidth in some areas. This aspect that was 
mentioned several times should be addressed in at least one pilot implementation 
scenario. 

Another aspect addresses typical issues caused by cross-boundary events, e.g., a downed 
aircraft near an international border such as between United States and Canada. This 
requires bringing together a wide variety of disparate data and cross border 
interoperability. 

Focus on integrating multiple types of data together (coverages, imagery, vector, sensor 
feeds) over a large scale to fully appreciate the value of a unified map service with shared 
semantics and a shared tiling approach. This can be demonstrated by 'plume' related 
disasters, whether nuclear accidents or volcanic ash at an international level, or 
widespread downwind pollution from wildfires and chemical incidents, usually at the 
more local level. It should be noted that plume events are intrinsically 3 or 4D and may 
be satisfactorily represented by existing (2D) spatial data infrastructures. 

Crowdsourcing Mobile application that provides real time geolocated visual information 
(photographic and survey).

6.4 Pilot Development 

The follow-on pilot(s) initiative implemented as a result of this CDS will not attempt to 
develop a different, new operational professional grade Disasters SDI. Instead, it will 
support the existing suite of Disasters SDIs by demonstrating their value to stakeholders, 
and by reinforcing / devising interoperability arrangements to address key Stakeholder 
challenges. Nevertheless, the following topics shall be considered during the 
development of the pilot(s), even though they usually apply to the development of a 
professional-grade SDI. 

1. Prepare Inventory and Assessment of Existing Disaster Systems, Portals, 
Applications, Data Sets and Databases. This involves assessing key existing 
geospatial systems and imagery. Inventory should cover formats, datums, 
metadata, standards used, etc. 

2. Development of a V1.0 Disasters Reference Architecture working with 
participants and the Domain Working Group and Technical Committee 
agreement. 

3. Improve Disasters SDI based on feedback and technology evolution. 

4. OGC Pilot to improve interoperability arrangements between providers and 
users testing that OGC services are discoverable in heterogeneous (or 
homogeneous) global community of providers.  

5. Outreach and adoption of standards and specifications. 

6. Leverage the U.S. GeoPlatform and a variety of geospatial community 
resources to support disasters. 

The specific themes or use cases for the pilots will be selected by the Sponsors during 
the Pilot Collaboration Phase for each of the pilots. The themes or use cases may be 
chosen from the previous topics reported above in this report. The Sponsors will decide 
what Disasters issues or shortcoming they wish to address during the particular pilot. 

 

 



 

 

Chapter 7: Operation & Organization 

 

The collective decision-making process often gets blurred by the large number of 
stakeholders that participate in an SDI and may implement very little overlapping and 
thus collective decision-making processes. Given that the goals of this CDS and follow 
on Pilot are to demonstrate the usability of a Disasters SDI for a large range or 
stakeholders, rather than defining a fully featured SDI from scratch, stakeholders can 
concentrate on high level operational goals instead. Several high-level operational goals 
were stated by many of the respondents in the responses to the RFI and these reflect, to 
some extent, established best practices.  

7.1 High Level Operational Goals 

In the following sections several high level operational goals are mentioned that were 
discussed in the RFI responses and are of ample importance in any collaborative decision 
support system that focus on disaster management. 

• Interoperability: The ability to easily share data across systems and users, is one 
of the most important priorities identified by the 



 Chapter 7: Operation & Organization 46 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

RFI respondents. An interoperable system must enable data access that can support many 
different users. This may require visualization or other mediation such as translating 
vocabularies to make data usable by different communities. Achieving interoperability 
will require adequate resources, a certain level of standardization, and a connected 
community. 

• Standards and Specifications: The overarching purpose of the disaster 
management community is to promote and facilitate collaboration towards the 
goal of sustained, and timely access to disaster data through useful, usable, and 
interoperable systems. This includes facilitating the adoption, implementation 
and development (where necessary) of standards that will enable free, open, and 
timely access to data. 

• Metadata: The objective of this activity is to develop recommendations on a 
common set of metadata elements relevant across disaster management, to 
facilitate discovery, interoperability, and sharing between data repositories and 
online portals. To start, this effort will focus on identifying initiatives that have 
established a metadata template, schema, or profile. Initially, a limited set of 
disciplines or focus areas will be identified to make the scope manageable. 
Wherever possible and practical, the effort will build on and/or contribute to other 
related initiatives. 

    



 Chapter 7: Operation & Organization 47 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

• Data Publication: The objective of this activity is to provide a guide on data 
publication and citation for the Disaster Management community. This would 
provide a resource to help them to publish data sets. 

• Including First Responder’s Perspectives, Knowledge and Information: 
There is probably no other group that can bring the practical perspectives, 
knowledge and information to get the most out of a Disasters SDI then First 
Responders. This knowledge is being increasingly utilized, but in many 
instances, it is still being overlooked or considered as an afterthought. The 
perspectives of First Responders must be heard directly. This will enhance 
understanding of how this knowledge can be used appropriately. 

• Community Building: Improved data sharing that is part of a broader global 
system requiring community building, collaboration, and coordination of efforts. 
To achieve this, a better understanding of the nature of the disasters data 
community (who is doing the work, where, and the systems and processing 
workflows, etc.) across many scales and what is collectively trying to be achieved 
is required. It is also important to recognize engaging with broader global 
initiatives ongoing in the disaster management.  

• Data Preservation and Rescue: Continuous re-use and re-purpose of past 
observations is key to increase current understanding. Therefore, data and all the 
necessary descriptive information must be preserved. Too often, preservation is 
forgotten, and data managers must pursue costly and time intensive data rescue 
activities. Even current data are at risk of loss. Strategic data rescue programs 
must be developed, and preservation must be prioritized as a long-term 
investment and cost-saving measure. 

• Adequate Resources: Making progress will require adequate financial, 
technical, and human resources. More focus is needed on the training of early 
career scientists and youth to ensure that they have the necessary data literacy to 
engage in intensive research while contributing to and benefiting from an open, 
interoperable system. 

 



 

 

Chapter 8: Technologies & Applications 

 

The feedback on current portals, applications and technologies used in disaster 
management, type of services that should be available as part of a Disasters SDI, or type of 
applications shall be developed that make use of Disasters SDI was quite varied.  

The general view was that there were many portals available but no method for easily 
determining what was available in each. There were a few respondents that described the 
NSDI as a great mechanism that can be leveraged. There was also the mention of possibly 
using the GEOSS platform as a resource to coordinate some disaster efforts.  

However, many respondents noted that there are many portals stakeholders could access to 
gain the information they need to respond to a disaster events; however, understanding 
which portals are most relevant, which subsets of relevant information might be contained 
in each, and particulars of the user interface with each multiply the complexity of getting 
any usable information at all. This tends to provide a massive barrier to user engagement. 
In particular, if experts in the geospatial field are finding it inordinately complex to use 
many portals to acquire all data required for a task, then there is no chance responders in 
an emergency situation will be able to do so. 



Chapter 8: Technologies & Applications   49

One of the RFI respondents was so frustrated trying to determine what public facing layers 
were available, and where they were located, that he produced his own lists showing the 
‘top’ internet address for over 200 public-facing ArcGIS servers with open data3. 

The small number of specific portals for Disaster Management indicates possible gaps 
between stakeholders such as data providers, SDI component operators, and SDI 
consumers that require further investigation. The major the goal of the pilots is to 
demonstrate the value of Disasters SDI to stakeholders, and therefore overcoming the 
Catch-22 situation that potential stakeholders are not aware of the capabilities of a Disasters 
SDI and therefore not using it; and the provider side not being able to better adapt to users’ 
needs, as they are not formulated and expressed. 

The list of current applications includes on the abstract level items such as: 

• geospatial portal development 

• incident and event management and decision support applications 

• mobile platform integration and cross platform mobile app development 

• data warehouse management 

• Internet mapping 

• metadata management 

• gateway creation 

• comprehensive data connectivity 

More detailed applications include: 

• water license management and water quality and quantity flow analysis, 
visualization and modeling 

• Infrastructure monitoring and planning 

• Decision Support Systems 

• Climate change research

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

A list of possible key applications that could be made available as part of a Disasters SDI 
include: 

• Dashboard for disaster monitoring/response 
• Metadata harvester/broker 
• SDI Portal for non-technical users 
• SDI portal for scientists 
• Oil spill tracker/forecaster 

The wide gamut of potential services shall support the following aspects: 

• Ease of discovery and use 
• First Responder community emphasis 
• Possibility of using in non or low-bandwidth environments 
• Use of relevant open standards 
• Service level agreements to address business and contractual agreements  
• Additional SDI applications could include more general applications like search and 

rescue; and social and demographic applications. 

A few future applications were also described as follows. 

• Predictive Services: modeling and other predictive services that could be shared 
as part of the common operating picture could be very valuable.  

• Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assisted Mapping: this field is growing, after some 
initial failures at road mapping with AI generated data in OpenStreetMap, it is now 
part of the HOT project at OSM.  

• Disaster Routing  



 

 

Chapter 9: Other Factors / Conclusion 

Other Factors 

Workshop participants and RFI respondents discussed other success factors or 
considerations seen as needed for a successful National SDI architecture for disasters.   

It was noted that a successful National SDI architecture for disasters will require careful 
coordination between the system design and architecture and organizational policies, 
responsibilities, roles, and incentives, considering both public and private sector needs and 
constraints, different time horizons and scales of operation, different stakeholder mixes 
across sectors, varied levels of government and community sizes, and challenging data 
integration issues. Careful attention will be needed to address issues such as information 
technology security, privacy and confidentiality, liability, legal interoperability of data and 
services, and resource allocation. Many of these factors were discussed in previous 
chapters. 

It was also noted that cooperation among federal agencies acquiring and producing data to 
the local responders was a priority and it was critical to be able to add data to the 
architecture quickly and without downtime or disruption. 

When dealing with the public, the NYC response included an addendum to their 
submission entitled, “Towards Comprehensive Engagement with the Public During All 
Disaster Phases”. This document has been included as Appendix E. 

It should also be noted that a respondent concluded with the following; “OGC can provide 
a useful role in bringing information, technology and people together. We believe 
encouraging government to establish persistent experimental infrastructure and funding 
on-going experimentation (a persistent sandbox environment) on-line would be a valuable 
way to encourage innovation and maximize value and would be essential strides in 
prioritizing Prevention and Preparedness alongside Response. If such an infrastructure was 
there and could be depended on, it would make each experiment cheaper to execute. This 
does though require commitment from many agencies and government research 
institutions.”4

 Chapter 9: Other Factors / Conclusion  52 

18-087r5 Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Conclusion 

There were common threads that weaved their way through many of the RFI responses and 
represent key conclusions based on the variety of responses. These conclusions are 
summarized as follows in no particular order.  

• From all the needs presented, they can be summarized into four, high level, 
overarching requirements of any Disasters SDI.  

1. Provide stakeholders with appropriate access to the spatial data they need.  
These data can be static as well as dynamic data that arise before, during 
and after the disaster.  

2. Allow different stakeholders at different locations to access the SDI. 

3. Allow for data exchange, especially the dynamic data, in an appropriate, 
efficient, and secure way. 

4. To achieve one, two and three will require the continued and increasing use 
of OGC and other open standards. 

• There appeared to be under serviced stakeholders with regards to a Disasters SDI. 
These were First Responders and the General Public. First responders need a more 
streamlined approach to discovering, accessing, processing, and applying data. 
They tend to have very focused requirements: needing specific data in a 
streamlined, easy to use interface within the confines of a narrow bandwidth 
environment.   
For the public, availability and simplicity appear to be key attributes. To achieve 
this within the Disasters SDI, improved outreach and more tailored interfaces need 
to be implemented. Moving forward more effort may have to be made to include 
these stakeholders. 

• Many responses described several new data sources that should be included in a 
Disasters SDI such as observations from UAVs and crowd-sourced data. It needs 
to be determined what other new data and standards can be used and are there other 
new tools that can be utilized to integrate these new data sources.  

• Integration of near real-time observations from both satellites and in-situ sensors 
is key. Traditionally, this has not been easily achieved due to the proprietary nature 
of the sensor interfaces. New technologies such as SensorThings API should be 



Chapter 9: Other Factors / Conclusion   53 
 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

considered to ease introduction and use the latest sensor  / observation technology.  
Also, auto-registry of sensors is a key requirement. 

• Going forward many respondents described the need to exercise a Disasters SDI 
in all phases the ‘life cycle’ of disaster management: 1) mitigation; 2) 
preparedness; 3) response; and 4) recovery. Any scenarios or use cases should 
attempt to address all four phases. 

• Need to determine what data is key in different disaster types; Hurricanes, earth 
quakes, tsunamis, floods, wild fires, tornados, and pandemics. Each type has 
different needs depending on the stakeholder. For example, data used in hurricane 
response for a first responder would be quite different then that required for a wild 
fire.  

• To help in remediating issues due to limited bandwidth during a disaster event 
much of the base or core data can be prepared in advance any loaded on mobile 
device for first responder / field use. This can be accomplished by leveraging the 
GeoPackage standard. 

• All data must be accompanied by metadata. As this can be extremely tough to 
implement, new ways should be explored to minimize the need for manually 
generated metadata. 

The above conclusions should not be regarded as a definitive list to be taken away from 
this report. Instead, these conclusions listed here may provide a focus for a future Disasters 
SDI and the pilot phase of the CDS.

organizations with a stake in the (National) Spatial Data Infrastructure ((N)SDI) and those 
issuing this RFI, such as DHS (here in particular FEMA), USGS, and also OGC, use and 
work with DFO data sets on a regular basis during disasters.  

The DFO uses conventional HTML. GIS formats (shp, tiff), and jpeg image format as well as 
Excel spreadsheet files to provide the various data. Recently though, the DFO has adopted 
OGC standards and protocols to increase data interoperability between various systems and 
users. For now, the primary OGC standard used is WMS. For a demonstration of this, see the 
DFO web portal at http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/WebMapServerDataLinks.html.

ScienceBase is a collaborative environment for communities to document and host 
their own scientific content.  The ScienceBase Catalog provides a fast and flexible 
data cataloging and discovery mechanism for over 8 million records.  It is backed 
by a REST API for search and update activities.   

• The National Map uses the ScienceBase Catalog to store metadata for all of it's 
publically available data products.  This FGDC metadata includes thesaurus-driven 
keywords defined by the National Map to aid query and filtering based on: dataset, 
product extent and product format. By leveraging the existing ScienceBase API, search 
and filtering capabilities were realized without the need to duplicate these capabilities 
for the National Map.

Appendix E: NYC Public Engagement 

Towards Comprehensive Engagement with the Public During All Disaster Phases 

1. Public Organizations and Social Entities With Possible Roles in Disaster 
Preparedness and Response 

a. Community Emergency Response Teams (NYC-CERT): Trained 
volunteers with emergency preparedness and response training. CERT teams 
are found in all 59 NYC Community Boards. 

b. Community Groups: The Existing Organized Social Structure 

i. Building Associations including Tenants Associations, Coop and 
Condo Boards 

ii. Block Associations 
iii. Neighborhood Associations 
iv. Community Boards 
v. Social and Single-Issue Organizations 

vi. Local offices of elected officials 

2. Systems that connect citizens with government first responders and with private 
utilities 

a. 911 Emergency Response: Often overwhelmed in a disaster. However, 
Police, Fire and EMS services are all locally based. If responders can be given 
up to date prioritized information about who needs help in a disaster, many 
problems can be avoided and lives saved by better deployment of field units. 

b. 311 Service Requests: Often overwhelmed in a disaster. But if information 
flows about outages and damage can be properly managed and prioritized, 
disaster response would be more effective because the field teams from 
responding agencies would be better directed. 

c. Utility Services Hotlines: Often overwhelmed in a disaster. See b. above. 

d. Social Media including Twitter, Facebook, and Crowd Sourced Applications 
(like the Google Crisis Response Team): Fragmented, generally disconnected 
from government responders, non-standardized data, etc. 

3. Types of Solutions to Solve the Responder/Citizen Synapse 



 Appendix E: NYC Public Engagement 75 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium   18-087r5 

a. Registries: Applications that utilize information about citizens who are 
disabled, frail, sick and depend upon services (electricity, nursing aid, food 
and medicine delivery) that may not be available during an emergency. 
Registries identify people who cannot self- evacuate.5 Registries can also 
include information about individuals who are located in particularly 
vulnerable areas where mandatory evacuation may be ordered. 

b.  Trained Community Informants: In addition to ad hoc and unstructured 
social media methods, a network of community liaisons drawn from 
neighborhood organizations can be trained to provided structured information 
about local conditions. Inputs can be mapped and flagged for the most 
threatening conditions. This can be an extension of the CERT program. 

a. Social Media: Standards must be established so that collected data obeys a 
common structure for easy synthesis, mapping and analysis. Social media 
must be drawn into the structured disaster response system. 

b. Preparedness: Resilience starts at home and the workplace. Smart strategies 
need to be designed so that residences and businesses, residents and workers 
have a level of resources and strategies that will get them through the acute 
phase of a disaster event. The Federally sponsored “All Together Now” 
Program attempted to do this.   
www.empowermentinstitute.net/index.php/community/resilient-community 
FEMA has extensive information on preparedness actions. But for the most 
part, individual preparedness programs have not been very successful. What 
would it take to improve them?
