Introduction 

 

This document describes a service -- called a Coverage Portrayal Service -- composed of 
standard interfaces that makes it possible to portray coverage data. The service is 
intended to operate within the context of existing OGC services and their clients. It 
operates as a client of an existing service that supplies coverage data. And it operates as a 
service for an existing type of geospatial client. 

By bundling together the client sides of some interfaces, and the server sides of other 
interfaces, the Coverage Portrayal Service becomes an intermediary service. As an 
intermediary service, this service raises interesting questions about how services  can 
and/or should be connected together. How much should a client of an intermediary 
service have to know about the remote service which it connects to? And how can it find 
out what it needs to know?

6 Coverage Portrayal Service 

6.1 Abstract 

The CPS is an OGC Processing Service that adds value to the products of a Web 
Coverage Service. The CPS links together WMS clients and WCS services, using SLD as 
a service language. The CPS interfaces are slight extensions or restrictions of the 
corresponding WMS interfaces. 

6.2 Purpose 

The purpose of the CPS is to provide a standard interface for producing visual 
pictures from coverage data. 

6.3 The CPS Operational Concept 

The CPS integrates into the OGC architecture by implementing two standard OGC 
interfaces, the WMS interface and the WCS interface.  Figure 6.3.1 shows this 
integration. The Engineering View format that this figure uses is taken from the OGC 
Services Abstract Specification1 and the OGC Web Services Initiative - Reference 
Architecture for Phase 1 Testbed DIPR. The dashed lines in the figure represent 
networks.

Figure 6.3.1 shows how a thin WMS map viewer client, which has been generated on the 
fly by a server-side client generator, can use the services of a WCS by connecting 
through a CPS. 
6.4 Use Case 

6.4.1 Description 

This use case presents the steps that might take place during a typical CPS session. 

6.4.2 Pre-conditions 

In this use case there are three components: 

- A WCS that provides a swath coverage 

- A CPS that styles a swath coverage 

- A client that knows how to define an SLD for a coverage, can make WMS-SLD 
GetMap requests, and can display the GetMap request to a human.

OGC 02-019r1 

 

6.4.3 Post-conditions 

The result is a visual representation of the swath coverage in a form that can be overlaid 
with additional WMS map layers. Figure 6.4.1 shows an example of a georectified swath 
coverage that has been overlaid with an additional map layer showing watercourses. This 
map layer has been requested from a separate WMS.

6.4.4 Flow of events 

1) A Web Coverage Service (WCS) publishes a layer containing a multi-band swath of 
data located in some region. 

2) A client finds that the published layer overlaps with its current region of interest and 
wishes to view the data in that layer graphically in order to determine if it bears further 
analysis, or further processing. 

3) The client finds a CPS and decides to ask it to provide a view of the data that can be 
overlaid with familiar map features.

OGC 02-019r1 

4) The client builds a Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) raster descriptor that assigns red to 
band 3 of the swath data from the WCS in question, green to band 2, and blue to band 1. 

5) The client formulates a Web Map Service (WMS) request which includes (alternately, 
refers to) the raster descriptor, together with a WIDTH, HEIGHT, BBOX, SRS, and so 
on. 

6) The client issues the WMS request to the CPS. 

7) The CPS receives the WMS request from the client, fetches the SLD if need be, and 
formulates a WCS request for the data from the bands which were mentioned in the SLD 
that covers the BBOX which was mentioned in the WMS request, and submits the WCS 
request. 

8) The WCS returns the requested coverage data to the CPS. If necessary the CPS 
geolocates the data in the requested BBOX and SRS, applies the SLD to produce an 
image of the requested sort, with the requested WIDTH and HEIGHT, and returns the 
image to the client. 

6.5 CPS and SLD 

The CPS uses SLD as a language to request a specific portrayal. In addition to request 
parameters, which serve to qualify the request action, additional information has to be 
provided to the CPS for it to be able to do its work. This additional information can tell 
the CPS  

1. where to get the coverage that the client is interested in, 

2. what part or parts of the coverage data to work with, and 

3. how the client wants the CPS to portray that data. 

SLD is used to express this additional information. The rationale for this is that (3) above 
is a sort of user-defined "styling" of (part of) the coverage data. 

There is a parallel between the way that a client can direct a CPS to use data from a 
WCS, and the way that a client can direct a WMS to use data from a WFS. Using SLD 
for both CPS requests and WMS requests exploits this parallel. 

The parts of the SLD that affect (3) above are contained in the SLD RasterSymbolizer 
element. The following subsections discuss some relevant aspects of this element. 

6.5.1 Histograms and mapping bands to colors  

Regarding the question of how selecting the histogram option affects the mapping of 
bands to RGB, the current SLD has this documentation: 

6 © OGC 2002 – All rights reserved
 



OGC 02-019r1 

ContrastEnhancement: Defines contrast enhancement for a channel of a false-color 
image or for a color image.  In the case of a color image, the relative greyscale 
brightness of a pixel color is used.  "Normalize" means to stretch the contrast so 
that the dimmest color is stretched to black and the brightest color is stretched to 
white, with all colors in between stretched out uniformly.  "Histogram" means to 
stretch the contrast based on a histogram of how many colors are at each brightness 
level on input, with the goal of producing equal number of pixels in the image at 
each brightness level on output.  This has the effect of revealing many subtle 
ground features. 

This document adopts the position that histogram equalization should be applied 
independently to each channel. In this way, assigning colors and doing histogram 
equalization are independent ("orthogonal") operations. 

The RasterSymbolizer allows independent contrast enhancement per channel and contrast 
enhancement for the final image as a whole.  The per-channel contrast enhancement is 
selected using the "RasterSymbolizer/ChannelSelection/*/ContrastEnhancement" and the 
overall contrast enhancement is selected with RasterSymbolizer/ContrastEnhancement". 

The exact method of histogramming the overall image is up to the implementation, but a 
suggested interpretation is to assign intensities to pixels based on the usual formula 

0.299 * red + 0.587 * green + 0.114 * blue 

and to change the result intensity by multiplying all components of an RGB pixel by the 
same amount. 

6.5.2 Mapping of categories via a color lookup table 

The SLD 0.7.2 documentation says this: 

ColorMap: Defines either the colors of a pallet-type raster source or the mapping of 
numeric pixel values to colors.  For example, a DEM raster giving elevations in 
meters above sea level can be translated to a colored image with a ColorMap.  
ColorMap entries should be in order of increasing numeric quantity so that 
intermediate numeric values can be matched to a color (or be interpolated between 
two colors).  Labels may be used for legends or may be used in the future to match 
character values. Not all systems can support opacity in colormaps.  The default 
"opacity" is 1.0 (fully opaque).  Defaults for "quantity" and "label" are system-
dependent. 

So if the categories are indexed numerically, then they can be handled by SLD.

6.5.3 Thematic map rendering 

The CPS needs to get the category classification from WCS for a thematic map in order 
to be used for thematic map rendering. Distinction needs to be done between nominal 
classification and ordinal classification. 

This information may be available to the CPS if the WCS supports a 
GetCoverageLayerDescription interface. That interface would return a coverage layer 
description encoded in XML that would include RangeDimension information (sample 
dimension) associated with a reference system (nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio). 

6.5.4 Other portrayal options 

There are other portrayal options, such as hillshading and contouring of coverage data, 
that are not included here. 

6.6 CPS and WCS 

If a CPS is to portray coverages using a user-defined styling, it is necessary to understand 
what is to be the source of the coverage data. Different relations between this data source 
and the CPS should be permitted.  For example a CPS might portray coverage data stored 
in a remote Web Coverage Server (WCS) or it might only be able to style data from a 
specific default coverage store. 

SLD allows a user to direct the CPS to use a remote WCS; this represents the simplest 
relationship between a CPS and a WCS.  However there is a wide range of other possible 
relationships.  To clarify the discussion, this document introduces the concept of 
‘component’ and ‘integrated’ services:  

• Component services: these are services designed to be loosely coupled and work 
in any combination.  For example, a component CPS can portray coverage data 
from any WCS to which it is directed.  A component service is synonymous with 
a loosely-coupled service as defined in the OGC Service Architecture2 

• Integrated services: these are services that are closely coupled and can only work 
in particular configurations.  For example, an integrated CPS might only be able 
to portray coverage data from the WCS with which it is integrated. A component 
service is synonymous with a tightly-coupled service as defined in the OGC 
Service Architecture3 

A loosely-coupled CPS may have an association with specific coverage type as identified 
in the service type definition. In the tightly-coupled case, the CPS service metadata

OGC 02-019r1 

describes both the service and the coverage. Also for the tightly-coupled case, the  
permitted values in the operations shall be constrained by the values defined by the 
coverage associated with the CPS. For the loosely-coupled case, dataset metadata need 
not be provided in the service metadata. 

Whether a particular service is a ‘component’ or ‘integrated’ service says something 
about how it is implemented.  For example a CPS is a ‘valid’ OGC CPS provided it 
correctly supports the CPS interfaces. This makes no assumptions about how the CPS is 
implemented.  However, a ‘component’ CPS that can portray coverage data from any 
WCS only interacts with the data through the WCS interfaces, and this does say 
something about the implementation.  Of course, it is not important what type of WCS 
(component or integrated) that a component CPS is directed to. There will be a spectrum 
of CPS implementations with the ability to support user-defined styling.  This is best 
illustrated by describing in more detail what might be considered the ‘two ends’ of the 
spectrum, represented by a ‘component’ CPS at one end and ‘integrated’ CPS at the 
other. 

• Component CPS 

Essentially a portrayal engine that can portray coverage data obtained from one or 
more remote WCS services.  Typically it has these characteristics: 

o A component CPS probably has no pre-defined ‘named’ layers or styles. 

o A component CPS only supports the CPS interfaces. 

o A component CPS can portray coverage data from any compliant WCS  or 
from any compliant WCS serving a specific type of coverage data type. 

o A component CPS supports both user-defined styles and user-defined 
layers. 

• Integrated CPS 

This is a service representing a closely coupled coverage store and a portrayal 
engine.  Typically it has these characteristics: 

o An integrated CPS probably has pre-defined ‘named’ layers and styles. 

o An integrated CPS supports the CPS interface and the 
DescribeCoverageType request of the WCS interface. 

o An integrated CPS can only portray coverage data from its own internal 
coverage store. 

o An integrated CPS might only support user-defined styles being applied to 
pre-defined ‘named’ layers.

OGC 02-019r1 

Whether one is using a component or integrated CPS, it must be possible to interrogate 
(albeit at a relatively superficial level) the underlying coverage store.  This is because 
user-defined styling makes use of concepts not previously required by WCS. User-
defined styling needs to be able to define new layers and styles using coverage types and 
coverage-type properties.  For example, a new layer might be defined as all the coverages 
of a particular coverage type. 

The underlying coverage store is interrogated using the WCS interface.  For a component 
CPS this is not a problem, since the coverage store is indeed a remote WCS.  For an 
integrated CPS, the server must support both the CPS interface and a minimal set of WCS 
operations.  It must support the DescribeCoverageType request.  This describes the 
properties of a coverage type specified by name in the request.  And, if the CPS supports 
user-defined layers, then it must support the WCS GetCapabilities request.  For a 
WCS this returns, among other things, the names of all the coverage types supported by 
the WCS.  Together these two WCS requests allow clients to retrieve all of the 
information that they will require in order to construct user-defined styling. 

It is also necessary to indicate where a CPS should find the coverage data that is to be 
portrayed. This is done using the following rules: 

1. if the SLD specifies a WCS in the WCS attribute of the UserLayer element then 
it should be used; otherwise 

2. the CPS should use a default WCS. 

This approach does not permit coverages from different WCS services to be included in 
the same styled layer; however, it does allow different styled layers to be based on 
coverage data from different WCS instances.  The first two options should only be used 
for a CPS that can be ‘directed’ to a remote WCS.  The CPS will advertise this ability in 
response to a GetCapabilities request.  For an integrated CPS, the default WCS is 
just the one with which it is integrated.  However, there is no reason why a component 
CPS should not have a default WCS defined. 

6.7 CPS and coverage transfer formats 

The WCS takes the position that a number of coverage transfer formats are currently in 
use in the geospatial community, and that it should not legislate which of these to use4. 
Of course for these transfer formats to be used by a CPS, they must be well defined. But 
from the point of view of the CPS (or of any automated client of a WCS, for that matter) 
there is an even more important requirement. Most of these formats are quite flexible, in 
that they allow the same data to be encoded in more than one way. So not only does there 
need to be a well-known definition of the transfer format, but also it is critical to have a 
mapping from each of the formats which a WCS supports to some kind of common 

                                                 

4 Note that Coverages are defined in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6 - The Coverage Type. 

10 © OGC 2002 – All rights reserved
 



OGC 02-019r1 

definition, which tells how the format is being used. Otherwise it is difficult or (more 
likely) impossible for the CPS to determine where the WCS has put the data that the 
client needs. 

The common definition would allow a CPS client to make definite references to parts of 
the coverage which are encoded in the coverage transfer format, without having to know 
in advance (perhaps by some out of bandagreement) how the transfer format was being 
used. In other words, the coverage can have a number of different domain and range 
components, the transfer format can define a number of different structural parts, and the 
common definition needs to say which coverage components are encoded in which 
structural parts of the transfer format. 

For an abstract illustration of this, assume we have two transfer formats, format H and 
format N, which transfer coverage data in structures Struct H and Struct N. (The parts of 
the structures are labelled using sequences of alternating horizontal and vertical 1-based 
indices.) 

 

 
1,1 

1,2 

2,1 

2,2,1

2,3 

2,2,2

Struct H 
 

 

 

1 

2,1 

2,2 

2,3 

3 

Struct N 
 

Also assume that there is a common definition. This means that there is a common 
structure Struct C, and a known semantics for the parts of the structure. So Struct C might 
look like this: 

 

© OGC 2002 – All rights reserved   11
 



OGC 02-019r1 

 1,1,1 1,1,2

1,2 

Struct C 
 

and the known semantics might be this: 

1,1,1 = domain dimension 1 

1,1,2 = domain dimension 2 

1,2  = range dimension 1 

Now what is required is a know mapping from the common structure, Struct C, to each of 
the transfer format structures. For example, the mapping to Struct H might be this: 

 

Struct C to Struct H 

1,1,1 = 2,2,1 

1,1,2 = 2,2,2 

1,2 = 2,3 

 

This would allow a user to talk about, say, domain dimension 1, and the automated client 
would know that, if it was dealing with a coverage encoded in Struct H, that what was 
meant was the data in part 2,2,1 of the structure. 

Of course Struct H might have its own semantics, for example: 

1,1 = some metadata 

1,2 = some more metadata 

2,1 = some dimension 

2,2,1 = some other dimension, and so on. 

While this semantics may be useful in its own right to some users of the coverage data, 
and should be compatible with the semantics that is implied by the mapping above, it

OGC 02-019r1 

does not in itself solve the problem of allowing a user to refer to interesting parts of the 
coverage data in an open and unambiguous way. 

7 CPS Service Interfaces 

The CPS interfaces modify the corresponding WMS interfaces in the following way. The 
CPS GetCapabilities interface extends the WMS GetCapabilities interface because the 
CPS needs to say something about its ability to interact with a WCS. The CPS GetMap 
interface restricts the WMS GetMap interface because the CPS requires SLD in order to 
function in a meaningful way. 

7.1 GetCapabilities 

The CPS capabilities response needs to say 

1. what parts of SLD are supported, 

2. what coverage transport formats are supported, and 

3. whether the CPS can do georectification. 

It would be useless for a client to direct a CPS to request data from a WCS when that 
WCS only supported coverage transport formats that the CPS could not handle. Therefore 
it should be possible for the client to discover in advance if the CPS and the desired WCS 
are incompatible in this way. A similar argument applies in the case of georectification. If 
a WCS only supplies ungeorectified data, and the CPS does not support georectification, 
then the client should be able to discover that fact. 

NOTE: The schema for the CPS GetCapabilities request has not yet been defined. 

7.2 GetMap 

The parameters to the CPS GetMap request are identical to the parameters of the WMS 
GetMap request. However, because the purpose of the CPS is to portray coverages, 
additional user-styling information needs to be encoded into SLD, and supplied with a 
CPS GetMap request.  

The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the CPS client, the CPS, and

Figure 7.2.1. 

As shown in Figure 7.2.1, some of the parameters that the CPS sends to the WCS are 
identical to the parameters that it gets from its client, some of the parameters it sends are 
derived from the parameters that it gets, and some of the parameters that it sends have to 
be extracted from the SLD Of the parameters that are extracted from the SLD, some are 
used for portrayal, while some are used to derive other parameters for the WCS.  

The following example shows how the interaction shown in Figure 7.2.1 would happen in 
a particular case. 

7.2.1 GetMap example  

In this example the CPS receives the GetMap request that is listed below, and generates 
the following WCS coverage request based on it: 

VERSION=1.0.3& 
REQUEST=coverage& 
LAYERS=mod2.hdf:SWATH:MODIS_SWATH_Type_L1B:EV_1KM_RefSB& 
SRS=EPSG:4326& 
BBOX=-106.38,38.78,-103.36,40.55& 
Band_1KM_RefSB=1/3/1&

FORMAT=HDFEOS 
 

and sends that coverage request to this URL: 

http://heineken.gsfc.nasa.gov:8080/cgi-bin/dib/wcshdfeos? 

by performing the following steps. 

1. It finds the 
GetMap/StyledLayerDescriptor/UserLayer/RemoteOWS/OnlineResource from 
the (SLD portion of the) request and fetches a capabilities document from there. 

2. It gets the OnlineResource for HTTP GET from the capabilities document, which 
it will use as the URL from which to request a coverage. 

3. It finds the 
GetMap/StyledLayerDescriptor/UserLayer/LayerFeatureConstraints/FeatureType
Constraint/FeatureTypeName, and tries to find the corresponding layer in the 
WCS capabilities document. 

4. It finds all the contents of RasterSymbolizer/*/SourceChannelName elements and, 
using the convention that if such a content looks like 

bandname.bandnumber 

then it looks for a Dimension in the layer named "bandname" that has an extent that 
includes "bandnumber". (Note that this convention is totally ad hoc. Perhaps SLD 
0.7.2 should provide separate elements for the dimension name and the channel 
name.) 

To make this more specific, assume the layer in question looks like this: 

<Layer queryable="1"> 
  <Name>mod2.hdf:SWATH:MODIS_SWATH_Type_L1B:EV_1KM_RefSB</Name> 
  <Title>EV_1KM_RefSB</Title> 
  <Abstract/> 
  <Keywords/> 
  <SRS>EPSG:4326</SRS> 
  <LatLonBoundingBox minx="-120.093803" miny="21.792076" maxx="-90.692970" 
maxy="42.964756"/> 
  <Dimension name="Band_1KM_RefSB" units="None"/> 
  <Extent name="Band_1KM_RefSB" default="1/15/1">1/15/1</Extent> 
  <DataURL>http://heineken.gsfc.nasa.gov:8080/cgi-
bin/dib/dib_view/hdf?mod2.hdf&amp;HDFEOS&amp;SWATH|MODIS_SWATH_Type_L1B&amp;
FIELD|EV_1KM_RefSB   </DataURL> 
</Layer> 

and the request has this:

<sld:RedChannel> 
  <sld:SourceChannelName>Band_1KM_RefSB.3</sld:SourceChannelName> 
</sld:RedChannel> 

 

and the layer has a Dimension with name = Band_1KM_RefSB 

and the corresponding Extent goes from 1 to 15, which includes 3.

8 Future Work 

Future work on CPS falls into three areas. 

8.1 Separation of Concerns.  

The information contained in a request to the CPS can be separated into information 
related to service coordination, information related to control of the functionality 
provided by a remote service, and information related to the control of the portrayal 
functions which the CPS provides. Currently these three kinds of information are 
conflated together in two different ways. 

8.2 Capabilities Definition 

The CPS needs to be able to make it clear what its capabilities are. The current 
assumption behind the use of SLD in general is that an SLD-enabled service should make 
a "best effort" attempt to comply with requests that use SLD. But it could be useful if 
there was a way to guide a client's expectations as to what a "best effort" might entail. 
Currently there is now way to say what part of SLD a service supports, and what part not. 
There is not yet a language for doing this, but the notion of binding templates would 
seem to be applicable here. 

8.3 WCS Interaction 

The interaction of the CPS with the WCS needs to be refined, with respect to the 
following issues.

OGC 02-019r1 

• What kind or kinds of coverages are available? Are they gridded or not? Are they 
georectified or not?  This future work should draw on the development of 
coordinate reference system identifiers for sensor CRS's and geographic CRS.  
This work is to better define the domain of the coverage.  Options for providing a 
sensor CRS or a grid of geographic lat/long points should be accommodated. 

• What kinds of attributes does the coverage offer?  This is the range question. 
Distinction needs to be done between nominal classification and ordinal 
classification.   

• What choices does the WCS make when it encodes coverage data into a coverage 
transfer format?
