Preface 

The scope of this report is to provide a description of services, data storage and data 
movement within the OWS-8 Tracking sub-thread. The paper outlines the development 
of Sensor Observation Services (SOS), a Web Feature Service(WFS), a Notification 
Service and a Web Processing Service (WPS) for generating track features. Additionally, 
implemented encodings will be discussed as examples and in comparison to the 
encodings detailed in (Simonis, 2011). 

This document is a deliverable for the OGC Web Services 8 (OWS-8) testbed activity. 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate standards or revisions to existing standards into OGC's Standards Program, 
where they are formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, 
international teams of technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing 
interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC 
Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments 
and interoperability support services - all designed to encourage rapid development, 
testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards. 

The OWS-8 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommend to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-8 initiative be organized around 
the following threads: 

    * Observation Fusion 

    * Geosynchronization (Gsync) 

    * Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 

    * Aviation

1.4 Future work 

Implementations discussed in this document were a first attempt at fitting a moving 
object tracking concept of operations into the OGC framework. This included the 
implementation of a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) to store MISB 0601.4 and 
EG0903.0 video metadata, a Web Feature Service (WFS) to store a GML representation 
of tracks based on the NATO STANAG 4676 data model and a Web Processing Service

(WPS) designed to use the SOS to generate track data and insert that data into a WFS. A 
number of future work items can be derived from this implementation. 

 SWE Observation representations of VMTI detection metadata: For OWS-8, 
VMTI data was obtained from 2 video files provided by the Australian DSTO. 
The target detection information available within these files fit the EG0903.0 
Local Data Set model. As the EG0903 set of standards moves forward (EG0903.2 
is now a recommended practice), the level of sophistication for the observation 
information stored in the SOS must consequently increase. While a 
straightforward “flat” approach to encoding properties of a Local Data Set  could 
suffice for EG0903.0, developments within the EG0903.2 standard e.g. chip run-
length encodings require a hierarchical structure for detections, frame information 
etc. This hierarchical structure is detailed in (Simonis, 2011). 

 Complete representation of STANAG 4676 concepts as GML: For OWS-8, 
derived track information was stored in a WFS. This information was encoded in 
a GML representation which was based on, but did not fully implement all the 
concepts developed in the STANAG 4676 standard. The goal for the test bed was 
to have a geo-referenced model of the essential track information for querying and 
display purposes. In order to develop a complete and useful representation of the 
track data emitted from any tracker, there must be support for topological 
dependencies between the identified feature types such as track points, segments 
and tracks themselves.  

 Accumulation and storage of evidence: For the track point information 
developed by the WPS in OWS-8, the individual frame from which a track point 
was derived was identified in the TrackItem feature. This was a URL to a frame 
item in the SOS. Further work needs to be done to identify a shared encoding 
model for any evidence used by the Tracking software. This would be a document 
or feature with appropriate evidence links maintained by the tracker as it does its 
analysis of the raw data. This evidence could be associated with a complete Track 
or its components. What is a useful degree of detail, and what the evidence 
encoding should be need to be developed in cooperation with domain experts. 

  Development of Standardized Property Definitions: As a means for clearly 
defining each observed property derived from the raw observation data and 
providing a link between OGC encodings and published standards from MISB 
and other standards bodies, it may be necessary to develop a set of mappings 
between MISB and STANAG observables and OGC encoded observables. At the 
very least, URIs should be identified and agreed upon for observable properties. 
This was done in a basic way for the test bed, but would need to be developed in 
further work. 

  Imagery Retrieval within the Tracking Con-Ops: Currently, there is a service 
definition available within the OGC architecture for retrieving still imagery, the 
Web Coverage Service. However, there is no service specifically designed for 
retrieving Full Motion Video based on time and geographic constraints. For 
OWS-8, an SOS was implemented that allowed for direct retrieval of still and 
motion imagery based on temporal constraints (this was possible because of the 
level of KLV encoding in the video itself). The traditional Sensor Web 



OGC 11-134

Enablement approach is to embed a URL to the imagery in an Observations and 
Measurement response and then use this URL to retrieve this data OR to embed a 
base64 encoded version of the stream in the Observations and Measurements 
XML. While the former approach is reasonable and was implemented in OWS-8, 
it is not a way to directly deliver the imagery and the latter approach has scaling 
issues when embedding FMV in XML. A related implication is that the 
architecture could move to a transactional scenario where the video data is 
transacted to an SOS as an observation. A clear way to fit such a transaction into 
the SWE framework might also need to be developed. While traditionally, Motion 
Imagery has had no rigorous geospatial reference, and would thus fall out of the 
scope of the OGC, recent developments point to a need to define how to deliver 
FMV directly as an extension to some existing OGC service or as a new service 
definition. 

 GMTI Observation Fusion: While not available within the testbed, there is an 
expressed need for working with Ground Motion Target Indicators provided from 
Radar detections. GMTI encodings for SWE have been developed in (Simonis, 
2011) and could be implemented provided that test beds have access to GMTI 
data and decoders. GMTI presents another set of challenges for developing track 
data and evidence retrieval. 

 Integration with available 4676 data: Further work in implementing tracking 
architectures would benefit from exposure to simulated to track data as it evolved 
from points, segments etc. into track features. References have been made to the 
track life cycle and reference data would be beneficial for analysis and 
implementation guidance.

5 Implementation results overview 

This Engineering report addresses implementations of components of the proposed 
architecture for the Observation Fusion Tracking sub-thread. The intent of this sub-thread 
was to develop a concept of operations for tracking using service and information models 
from the OGC. The following diagram illustrates a proposed architecture developed 
within OWS-8.

Figure 1 – Proposed Architecture (Simonis, 2011)  

  

Within Figure 1 we see the core of the process is built around three services: an SOS for 
storing VMTI/GMTI data, a WPS for creating track data from the VMTI data and a WFS 
for storing the generated track data. 

Due to data availability, GMTI data was left out of the implementation.  Furthermore, 
WFS for storing track evidence was not implemented. STANAG 4676 provides a URL 
for referencing Track data and this was used for evidence references in the test bed. This 
leads us to the architecture illustrated in  



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 7 
 

 

Figure 2 – Implemented Architecture 

The VMTI SOS was implemented to support Observations and Measurements 2.0 and the 
new SWE set of standards.  Observations were modeled using SWECommon. 

The WPS implementation was designed to be invoked using direct references to the SOS 
GetObservation requests and WFS Transactions to extract target and motion imagery 
data, and to use this data to calculate tracks for moving objects and insert these objects 
into the WFS. The WPS was designed to be compliant with OGC WPS specification 
version 1.0.0.  

The WFS was built according to the WFS 1.1.0 specification. In addition to storing a 
representational model of STANAG 4676 track data, the WFS was designed to provide 
notifications to subscribers based on a subscription / notification pattern derived from 
WSN and work done by the OGC PubSub working group. Subscription notifications 
were delivered as raw GML features or brokered as GeoSMS messages.  



OGC 11-134

Software clients were developed to subscribe for updated track features. These clients 
could be used to visualize the track geometries, associated track metadata and video 
frame evidence encoded in the track data. 

In the process of implementing these components, some key points were brought to 
attention : 

 The PubSub / notification pattern can work, but requires further development. 
This will be addressed by the work of the PubSub working group of the OGC. 
Issues evolve around event patterns, clearly identifying event topics and 
message structures at the service level and delivery mechanisms for these 
events.  During OWS-8 guidance was taken from work done in OWS-6, PubSub 
working group and WSN, but the ultimate implementation across services is a 
work in progress. Further development along these lines should be closely 
integrated with PubSub proposals as they become available. 

 STANAG 4676 can be represented using GML features in a WFS. 
 Track generation can be accomplished using a WPS using stored target 

detections and motion imagery from an SOS, however, real-world operations 
may cause a need to defer the use of the SOS until after tracks are generated. 

 The tracker WPS is required to accumulate and store “evidence” metadata for 
the generated tracks. This evidence can be referenced but not stored in the 4676 
track data, pointing to a need for a standardized format that encompasses all 
types of evidence for tracks. 

 A number of shortcomings in the data set provided for the test bed caused a set 
of challenges for the tracking algorithm. These are discussed in detail in section  
7.3. 

 The SOS standard may need to provide a way to directly access binary 
information like video data as observations. 

 The current architecture is not set up for real time delivery of track information. 
Bottle necks can occur in processing video data to the SOS and track production 
at the WPS. 

6 SOS implementation 

The SOS implementations for this sub-thread were aimed at providing Capabilities and 
Observation results based on the new SWE suite of protocols and service standards. 
These included SOS 2.0, SWE common and Observations and Measurements 2.0. The 
emphasis for these SOSes was on using a temporal filter for retrieving observations of 
frame, target and motion imagery directly as binary data such as mpegs or jpegs or as 
metadata expressed as SWE Common and O&M 2.0.  The SOS was determined to be an 
adequate container for the data within the proposed concept of operations. 
Implementation issues revolved around the precision of temporal filters extracted video 
clip and data excluded from the data model.

6.1 Available data sets 

For OWS-8, experimental data was provided as two motion imagery files from the 
Australian DSTO. These files, in addition to video data, contained metadata multiplexed 
into the video stream according to MISB standards 0601.4 and EG0903.0. In order to 
accurately insert this data into the SOS, ingestion software was developed to parse the 
KLV encoded metadata from the data streams and insert the metadata into two offerings, 
one being frame metadata and the other being target metadata. 

The ingestion software was built on the software packages xuggler and ffmpeg. Video 
data was parsed and packets on the metadata stream were identified as KLV. These 
packets were cross referenced with the corresponding MISB KLV encoding standards 
and inserted into a database designed to house the pertinent metadata properties. 

Four SOS offerings were created for each supplied video stream.

 

Figure 3 – Storage of Video Frame and Detection Information in SOS 

Offerings are described in the sections tables below. Of importance to note is that the 
relevant and available data from each MISB dataset has been captured based on the data 
provided. Expansion of the offerings based on more sophisticated data should be part of 
future work. Some values were derived from the raw metadata. Derived values will be 
discussed.  

6.2 The Frame offering 

The frame offering is built from the MISB 0601.4 and EG 0903.0 dataset encoded in the 
video stream. It encompasses each individual frame in the imagery stream for which there 
is frame metadata encoded. Uses of this offering include the development of tracks as 
targets are cross-referenced with frame imagery and plotting track points on frame 
imagery to be presented to the user.

Table 1 – Frame Offering shows the observed properties available for this offering. In 
addition to each property presented in the table, two relevant properties required in an 
O&M observation are present for any observation from this offering: the phenomenon 
time which is derived from the frame timestamp and the sampling geometry which is 
derived from the latitude and longitude offsets from the frame center as in the following 
example.

The sampling geometry is represented as an inline GML 3.2 Polygon of two dimensions. 
The representation could be improved to include altitude if an elevation model was 
available. It was decided to derive the polygon representation of the frame corners as this 
would aid selection by spatial filtering and provide a sampling geometry directly. 
Because of this, the frame offsets were not retained because this was deemed to be 
redundant.  

Where possible, observed properties in the offering were given names directly based on 
the names of the fields in the MISB standard.  A frame URL observed property was 
derived from the source data based on the timestamp. This URL is designed to be 
retrievable as a jpeg image.

The frame URL derived value is given an observed property urn which implies that it is 
from the 0903 dataset. This is not the case and another property definition should be 
developed. 

An example observation request and response is located in . 

6.3 The TargetResult Offering 

The TargetResult Offering was developed to support the geographical and frame location 
of target detections recorded in the target local data pack defined in MISB EG0903 
(Motion Imagery Standards Board, 2009). These detections are essential for developing 
track information. These detections are used as a seed for deriving points along a track 
occupied by a moving object. 

When ingesting the data for this offering, it was necessary to maintain prior frame 
metadata as parts of the target pack refer to the VMTI LDS data pack associated with the 
frame. This frame data is not always available directly with the target detections and must 
be inferred using the last known VMTI LDS entry. Additionally, the target data in the 



OGC 11-134 

12 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

data samples lacked higher order information regarding the target pixel information. 
These properties were captured in the offering, but were not populated as the supporting 
data was not in the samples. 

For the sampling geometry, a quadrilateral was chosen similar to the quadrilateral chosen 
for the frame offering. This was in anticipation of area target information and not just 
point target information. The resulting target geometry was always a polygon with no 
area. The value for this quadrilateral was calculated using the associated frame center 
Latitude and Longitude and target offset.

One observed property that should have been included in the target offering was the 
frame number. Because the frame number was not explicitly included, cross-referencing 
targets to frames was done using time stamps. This was possible, but not ideal. 

6.4 The Video Offering 

The Video offering was designed to generate video clips defined by a temporal range 
filter. There are two typical uses for this offering. The first is that a tracker can request 
segments of video based on detection time ranges. Thus the tracker would not need to 
download the complete clip, but segments at a time. The second application was for 
clients to retrieve video evidence directly without needing to download O&M metadata, 
parse it and then retrieve the video clip using an embedded video link.  

In OWS-8, the tracker made use of the video offering, but the presentation of the video 
data was imperfect and allowances had to be made in software to return the complete 
video stream.  An ideal software implementation would present the video data accurately 
synched to frame number and timestamps in the detection data. Additionally, video clips 
would be multiplexed with the original VMTI metadata. Video clips were extracted and 
returned successfully, but no software library was found that would retain the VMTI 
metadata. 

In addition to direct delivery of video data, the Video Offering presented an O&M 
response that contained a text result that was a URL to the video clip. 

In future work, it is worth investigating the application of spatial filters to video 
observations that have spatial metadata associated with the frame information. 

The SOS standard has no provision for direct delivery of binary data as an output format 
for a GetObservation request. How this would be implemented for observations that have 
a time period and not an associated time instant is a matter for discussion outside this 
document. For VMTI encoded video data, video is also given a spatial component which 
opens up the possibility of requesting the video using spatial filters, temporal and spatial 
filters in combination, using other aspects of the video metadata as filter properties etc. .  

One could imagine a query that asks for video data that covers a particular area and time 
that contains more than 10 detections and has a dominant detection pixel color of white. 
Parameters defining the presentation of the returned data such as the CRS of the video 
frames and mask colors for areas with no data could also be relevant to such a query.

6.5 The Frame Image Offering 

The Frame Image Offering was implemented as a method for retrieving a raw jpeg image 
for a frame from the motion imagery using a time instant temporal filter. This offering 
fulfilled the same functions as the video offering, but for a single frame. This offering 
was used by client software to retrieve video imagery, but was not used by the tracking 
algorithm. 

7 WPS Tracker implementation 

7.1 Tracker Algorithm 

In order to turn raw video and VMTI detections into a moving object track, a processor, 
typically known as a tracker is involved. For OWS-8, this processor was implemented 
using the OGC WPS 1.0.0 specification (Yu & Chen, 2011). The algorithm for detection-
to-track is based on the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi feature tracker. All frames, not just the 
frames with metadata, must be retrieved together in order to better facilitate the 
assumption of the tracking algorithm. The algorithm assumes that an object moves only 
slightly across frames. If there is a big "jump" of tracking object between frames, the 
algorithm would not work or easily lose the object under tracking. Once the feature is 
found in the target frame, the closest detection from the metadata is used in the track if 
there is one such detection point in the metadata that is not farther than 10 pixels in this 
case.  KLT also supports multi-resolution tracking to deal with relatively large 
displacements of targets between video frames. Affine computation was enabled with 
KLT to deal with non-consecutive frames. In the implementation, empirical adaptation 
and adjustment were supported to achieve best results of tracking in a geospatially-aware 
sense. These include enhancements for : 

 being adaptive to the size of target under investigation by defining the tracking 
target window size, 

 being capable of varied range of displacements by adaptively adjusting the 
parameters for multi-resolution / pyramid, and 

 being tolerant to occlusion by using a momentum to track the target through 
occluded area.

7.2 Tracker Inputs and Execution Sequence 

The three SOS offerings used by the WPS were Frame, TargetResult and Video. These 
were defined as inputs to an instance of a WPS “Execute” request. An example of the

 

Figure 5 -- Tracker Inputs 

Execute Request/Response documents can be seen in Annex section A.1.  After the 
immediate response is returned, clients have the opportunity to test the status of the 
executing process by using the returned URI to the status servlet. A positive successful 
status response would be followed by a request for results which would return a reference 
to the results of the process which is an insertion into a WFS. The following diagram 
indicates the sequence of events involved as a client invokes the tracking WPS.

16 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

    

 

Figure 6 -- WPS Sequence Diagram 

The ultimate result of the tracking process as seen in the diagram is insertion of Track 
Data in a WFS. The nature of the Track features in the WFS is the subject of the next 
section. 

7.3 Lessons learned and discussions 

During the development and use of the tracking algorithm, a number of problems arose 
around the data that was available. What follows are discussions and recommendations 
based on these issues. 

7.3.1 Target Characteristics and Algorithm Traceability 

Problems: 

Features for extracting the detections in the video frames can be very useful at the stage 
of forming the tracks from detections. Here, detections are those points or locations 
where the targets are identified. The detections may be determined by some target-
detecting algorithms. 

One of the tasks for tracking algorithm is to compute the similarity between detections 
and therefore determine if they are detections for the same moving target in the same 
track. Features for computing the similarity between detections may include geometrical 
(e.g. size, width, height), radiometric (e.g. spectral range at different bands), and/or 
complex features (e.g. SIFT). These features may be used during the detection stage. It 



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 17 
 

can be useful information for tracking if these features and their deriving algorithm are 
known to the tracking algorithm. 

These may not be an issue if the detection and tracking are done by the same party 
because they implicitly know what algorithm is used for extracting detection features and 
the nature of the information passed along. However, if the detection and the tracking are 
realized by different parties or at a different time, the knowledge of the algorithms and 
nature of the data is not traceable.  

Tracking algorithms need to have some way to compare the similarity between detections 
across frames. Ideally, the tracking algorithm would require information of geometrical 
characteristics, radiometric characteristics, and algorithms for extracting these detections 
(no matter if the features are geometrical, radiometric, or hybrid features). 

In the GMU Implementation of Detection-to-Tracking algorithm, the dimension of the 
target can be very a useful feature for KLT algorithm. The use of target dimension can be 
used in combination of KLT multi-resolution capability to enhance the accuracy of target 
tracking.  However, the dimensions aren’t completely available to the algorithm. 
Therefore, these are exposed as input parameters for the WPS. Ideally, these should be 
automatically extracted from the detection metadata. 

In MISB 0601, there is some target size information as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8. 
However, these may not be properly tagged for all detections. Some detection has 
incomplete information or even none at all. Figure 9 shows one example that has target 
width.

Figure 8. Target Track Gate width and height in MISB 0601 



OGC 11-134 

18 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

Figure 9. Target size information in one detection example 

In the case of multiple moving targets occurring in the same frame, the scheme of MISB 
0601 may not be sufficient in properly defining every target under tracking. One target 
may have a significantly different dimension from another in the same frame. So, the 
dimensions may have to be defined in each VMTI tag, or in MISB EG 0903.  

In the current OGC Information Model to model the VMTI data, the dimension of target 
isn’t enabled. This might be due to the inconsistency of detection tagging in the example 
VMTI dataset. The SOS does not have target width passed along even if there is target 
width info in the original video under MISB 0601.  



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 19 
 

Recommendations: 

(1) MISB or NATO standards: Detection characteristics should be defined and 
described for any target under detections.   

a. Add more geometrical/radiometric information model into MISB 0903 
VMTI description or MISB 0601. Reference model may refer to ISO 
19115.  

b. Add algorithm information model provenance/lineage into MISB, 
including the detection algorithm used and the model to retrieve the 
detection features.  Reference model may refer to ISO 19115-2. 

c. Geometrical information model may be added to MISB 0903 at LDS for 
VMTI. This may be more relevant if there are multiple targets with 
different dimensions occurred in a single frame. 

(2) OGC Informational Model: OGC information model should precisely model all 
the information available in MISB specifications. 

a.  Size and other geometrical metadata should be passed along to be 
modeled in the O&M of the SOS. 

b.  If the MISB provide expansion facility, the OGC information model 
should describe a similar mechanism to accommodate specific profiles or 
expansions.  

7.3.2 Target Motion Metrics for Detections 

Problems: 

Dead reckoning may be necessary in continuously moving target tracking. When a target 
moves along a road or path, it can be occluded by overhead coverage or below similar 
pavement to the color of target body. To keep track of the target, a momentum may be 
added to the target to estimate how far and in what direction the target will keep moving 
if the tracking algorithm loses sight of the target temporarily. In the GMU 
implementation of Detection-to-Tracking WPS, a momentum is used to keep the target 
moving in the same direction and speed over the average of certain numbers of previous 
frames. This has been proved to be very useful in the case of tracking the vehicle moving 
across the bridge where the vehicle has a very similar tone to its background road surface. 
The KLT algorithm loses track of the target during these frames but eventually emerges 
after several frames. The added momentum solved the problem of losing the tracking 
target in this case. 

From this experience, it is obvious that motion metrics of the target under 
detecting/tracking can be very useful in keeping the correct tracking of target under these 
cases of occlusion. Any added information about the characteristics of the target under 
tracking would be very helpful. Explicit intentions or interest would help. For example, 
tracking a truck may be different from a tracking a special police car. Common sense 
may be taken into consideration. In an Interstate highway, a vehicle is normally moving 



OGC 11-134 

20 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

at 70mph while special police car may move at a slightly faster speed, e.g. 80 mph on 
average. The general sense of speed may be useful in correcting the automatically derived 
speed from tracking algorithm. 

In MISB 0903, velocity and acceleration are fields in the VTracker LDS as shown in 
Figure 10. However, the example dataset provided for use in the OWS-8 does not have 
any detection containing these fields.  

 

Figure 10. Speed and acceleration tag in MISB 0903 

Recommendations: 

MISB standards and dataset for experiment: 

(1) In MISB 0903 or 0601, extension may be added to support the description of the 
target as different types that have different range of speed/acceleration. 

(2) Experiment dataset should have the info. 

7.3.3 Sensor Metadata for Frame Co-Registration 

Problems: 

Frame co-registration is a crucial step for accurate tracking of targets if the video camera 
position changes drastically during video-recording. Automatic co-registration only 
works if the two frames do not differ significantly. For example, SIFT can be used to 
select candidate identical points across consecutive frames. However, the identical points 
may not be possible using SIFT if the frames have significant difference between the two 
frames. 



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 21 
 

In MISB 0601 specification, there are sensor angle and location information, also 
platform angle and location information. The example dataset does not have complete 
information for all the detections. Some detection has partial metadata as shown in Figure 
11. Some does not have any at all. 

 

Figure 11. Camera metadata of MISB 0601 in the example dataset 

In the information model used in the OWS-8 demonstration, the retrieved observations 
from the SOS do not contain any of these metadata. The incompleteness of camera 
position metadata might be the reason for the OGC information model to omit these in 
OWS-8. 



OGC 11-134 

22 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Recommendations: 

MISB standards and datasets: 

(1) VMTI dataset with complete camera position should be provided for testing. 
(2) OGC information model for modeling the MISB 0601 should have these metadata 

encoded and made accessible through SOS. 

7.3.4 Cross-referencing for Performance – Incremental Processing 

Problems: 

Incremental processing should be enabled with the Detections-to-Tracks WPS. 
Incremental processing should allow the instant processing of long video streams without 
delays or waiting until the whole video is available. The current implementation of the 
tracking WPS does not enable incremental processing. The reason is that exact cross-
referencing of frame, metadata, and video is not possible with the current implementation 
of OGC Information Model in the SOS. The SOS only provides the frames and their 
metadata when such frames have metadata information. The SOS omits those frames that 
have no metadata. For example, Figure 13 shows the frame #2007 metadata retrievable 
from the SOS and Figure 12 shows the frame #2012 retrievable from the SOS. All frames 
between 2007 and 2012 do not have metadata and these frames cannot be retrieved from 
the SOS.  

The GMU tracking WPS use KLT as the backbone algorithm that assumes there is little 
change across frames. Adjacent frames have to be used to keep tracking the target 
continuously. Ideally, the algorithm needs to retrieve the frame and its corresponding 
frame metadata (or VMTI metadata). If there is no metadata, the frames should still be 
retrievable. The current implementation of OGC Information Model modeling the VMTI 
data does not support such cross-referencing. Two issues can be seen from the example: 
(1) frames without metadata are not retrievable from the SOS; and (2) frame number is 
referred to the original video in completeness that has no correspondence to the frame 
retrieved from the SOS unless the original video is retrieved and used as a whole.

Figure 13. Frame 2007 retrieved from the SOS 

 

Recommendations: 

Cross-referencing of frame, frame metadata, and video segments should be enabled 
through the OGC Information model for VMTI data. For example, an updated frame 
number may be assigned. The number should be relevant to the video segment to be 
retrieved, if the same period is defined to retrieve frames, metadata, and video segment. 

7.3.5 Accurate Target Detection for Performance – One Target One Detection 

Problems: 

Multiple detections are assigned for one single target in one frame. Figure 14 shows one 
example. Target 1 and Target 6 is so close to each other, only one pixel displacement, to 
be possibly recognized as two different targets. They are actually one target with different 
target ID. These situations create confusion for the tracking algorithm to determine which 
one should be used in the track. In the implementation of GMU Detection-to-Track WPS, 



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 25 
 

a pre-processing to combine targets was adopted.  this figure target 1 and target 6 are the 
same target.  

 

Figure 14. Multiple detections for single target in one frame 



OGC 11-134 

26 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

Recommendations: 

The detection algorithm should generate the VMTI detections with the constraints that 
one target should have only one detection. 

 

7.3.6 Multiple Target Detections for Performance – Moving Targets in Different 
Directions 

Problems: 

The example dataset has another special case that creates problems in tracking objects 
when two moving targets meet. The case is shown in Figure 15, Figure 16, and Figure 17. 
In Figure 15, two vehicles are tracked, labeled as vehicle A and B. They have detections 
described in VMTI. When the two vehicles are crossing each other, some frames have 
metadata for one vehicle but not both.  In the frame shown in Figure 16, vehicle B has 
metadata but vehicle A does not. In the frame shown in Figure 17Figure 16, vehicle A 
has metadata but vehicle B does not. This inconsistency creates confusion for the tracking 
algorithm because both vehicles are so close in these frames. Both detections fall within 
the threshold of being assigned to either track. The tracking algorithm can easily assign 
the detection to wrong track. 

If both detections are labeled, this problem can be eliminated in combination with the 
directional arcing adopted in the GMU implementation of Detection-to-Track WPS. The 
directional arcing is simply a forward looking of frames ahead before finally deciding 
which track should be associated to the detections.

Recommendations: 

The VMTI dataset should label and provide all detections if multiple targets under 
tracking occurred in the same frame, Especially when targets occur in the same frame 
where targets are close together and move in different directions.  

8 Web Feature Service implementation 

NATO proposed a standard for transmitting and sharing track information; this standard 
is known as STANAG 4676. It defines a track as a set of associated state vector estimates 
describing the time-sequenced location, velocity, acceleration, and other relevant 
characteristics of a mobile object or group of objects 

For OWS-8, the tracking thread required a way to store and retrieve information modeled 
after the STANAG 4676 standard. We wanted the ability to store and retrieve both the 
current location of a detection, as well as the full path (track) of the same object. 
Compusult implemented a Web Feature Service (WFS) that partially modeled STANAG 
4676 data as GML features. 



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 29 
 

8.1 Feature Type Implementations in the WFS 

The STANAG 4676 UML model developed for OWS-8 (Simonis, 2011) features Tracks 
as a complex type, consisting of one or more TrackItem elements. A TrackItem could 
then be either a TrackInformation element or a TrackPoint element, each of which had 
their own complex types as sub-elements. In order to maintain a manageable feature type 
in the WFS, the data model was flattened as much as possible, leaving just track 
information and track points, which were associated back to a parent track. Fields that 
were not relevant to the scenario were left out of the feature type definition, to keep the 
schema and generated XML at a smaller size and avoid a lot of empty fields that we did 
not have sample data for.

A problem arose in attempting to model the geospatial information associated with a 
track point.  There was a recursive problem with Position types, as a Position could be 
one of GeodeticPosition, LocalCartesianPosition, or LocalPolarPosition. However, both 
the LocalCartesianPosition and LocalPolarPosition types had a LocalCoordinateSystem 
element, which had an origin element, which was of type Position. Thus it was possible 
for a Position to have an infinite number of sub positions associated with it. To simplify 
things, we assumed that all Positions were of the non-recursive GeodeticPosition type. 

The feature type definition of the Track is provided in Annex B. The following diagram 
illustrates the model as implemented for OWS-8.

8.1.1 Inserting Track Data 

As the tracker was to consume data from the SOS and then insert features into the WFS, 
it was only necessary for the track to be inserted once, at the point of first detection. From 
that point on, track points could be inserted, but the parent track was only updated. 

8.1.2 Updating Track Data 

When additional SOS detections were available to the tracker, new track points were 
inserted into the WFS. Rather than require the tracker to also update the track with the 
new geometry information, the WFS service automatically updated with the latest 
geometry coming from the inserted track points. 

A sample track point insert can be seen in A.7. 

9 Notification Service implementation 

As there was a need in the Tracking thread to be able to send notification messages 
regarding what was being tracked, Compusult’s WFS service had to be extended to 
provide “PubSub” (Publish/Subscribe) capabilities. As there was already an OGC 
PubSub working group, we attempted to follow guidelines that they were putting in 
place, although they are still working toward a final solution and thus we had to make our 
own implementation decisions. 

9.1 OASIS Web Services Notification (WSN) 

The OASIS WSN standard was chosen as the basis for our notification service as it 
provides a framework for subscriptions and notifications, and was under consideration by 
the OGC PubSub working group. 

WSN defines Subscribe, Renew, and Notify requests and responses, which were used by 
our notification service and clients. 

The WSN framework is flexible, allowing “Any” elements inside the XML requests to 
allow subscription filters to be based on any XML element. Unfortunately, “Any” 
element also meant that it was easy to have XML that validates against the WSN schema, 
but that doesn’t match the format that the web service is expecting. As such, 
communication outside of the schema provided by the web service to the client was 
required so that clients would be sending data in the expected format. 

9.2 SubscriptionManager 

Ideally, subscription operations would be added to the existing Web Feature Service 
(WFS). However, any new operations added to the WFS could not be advertised via a 
WFS GetCapabilities request because a response containing new operations would 
invalidate the GetCapabilities response against the WFS schema. This could cause 
problems for clients that use schema-generated code to parse the XML response. 



OGC 11-134 

36 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

It was easier to create a separate web service to act as the Subscription Manager on behalf 
of the Web Feature Service, at least until the PubSub operations are officially added into 
a future version of WFS. 

9.2.1 Subscribe 

A Subscribe request requires 3 pieces of information: 

1. Where to send notifications (ConsumerReference) 
2. What to subscribe to (Filter) 
3. How long to subscribe for (InitialTerminationTime) 

A sample Subscribe request can be seen here: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The Subscription Manager would respond with the following SubscribeResponse which 
contains a unique Address identifying the subscription at the SubscriptionManager :

9.2.2 Renew 

Prior to a subscription expiring, a client can request that the subscription be extended by 
sending the following request: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<Renew xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/b-2" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

f9bfb9467d36</add:RelatesTo> 
 </add:ReferenceParameters> 
</Renew> 

The subscription manager will then return the following response: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<RenewResponse xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/b-2" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

9.2.3 Topics 

The scenario called for objects to be tracked within a defined area of interest (AOI). 
Thus, two types of notification messages were expected: 1) notification that an object had 
entered or exited the area of interest; and 2) detections of the object as it moves within 
the area of interest. 

Different clients would be interested in one of these two possible types of notification 
messages. The GeoSMS notification broker would want to be notified of objects that are 
entering the specified area of interest, and would then generate a GeoSMS message to 
their subscribed clients with a reference back to the original detection. A map client, on 
the other hand, would be interested in receiving all object data so that it can draw and 
track the object on a map as it moves within the area of interest. 

To support different types of notifications, we made use of the concept of Topics. Topics 
were advertised to the clients by placing them inside the ExtendedCapabilities section of 
the WFS GetCapabilities response. 

The following TopicSet was created: 

<ows:ExtendedCapabilities> 
 <wstop:TopicSet xmlns:wstop="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/t-1" 
xmlns:wfs="http://www.opengis.net/wfs" 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
xsi:schemaLocation="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsn/t-1"> 
  <wfs:Match wstop:topic="true"> 
   <wfs:EnterArea wstop:topic="true" /> 
   <wfs:ExitArea wstop:topic="true" /> 
  </wfs:Match> 
  <wfs:Transaction wstop:topic="true"> 
   <wfs:Insert wstop:topic="true" /> 
   <wfs:Update wstop:topic="true" /> 
   <wfs:Delete wstop:topic="true" /> 
  </wfs:Transaction> 
 </wstop:TopicSet> 
</ows:ExtendedCapabilities> 

Clients that were interested in receiving “match” notifications (that is, an object matching 
the area of interest) could subscribe to the “Match” topic, or two either or both of the 
“EnterArea” and “ExitArea” subtopics. 

Similarly, clients that were interested in receiving all data could subscribe to the 
“Transaction” topic, or to any or all of the “Insert”, “Update”, and “Delete” subtopics. 

9.3 Notifications 

When a WFS Transaction comes into the WFS, the web service compares the Transaction 
to the subscriptions that were registered against it. 



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 39 
 

Notification messages are generated by the WFS for any subscription that the Transaction 
satisfies. 

9.3.1 Match 

If the client specified the Match topic, they will receive a Notify message that includes 
geospatial information as well as the GetFeature request URL. 

A sample match notification can be seen here:

9.3.2 Transaction 

If the client specified the Transaction topic, they will receive a Notify message that 
includes full FeatureCollection information from the WFS.

A map client can translate this FeatureCollection information into data that can be 
rendered as points and tracks on a map.  

10 Client Implementation 
 

10.1 Client Data Flows 

For OWS-8, the scenario revolved around the concepts of subscription to track 
information. The analyst user would subscribe for notifications of new track data. When 
these notifications were received, the analyst would be able to access the track data and 
visualize the data on the map. Once the track data was accessible, the analyst could use 
metadata to retrieve the imagery evidence provided in the track data and display track 
information directly on the imagery. This data flow was proven in concept. The following 
table provides the use case used for the OWS-8 demo. 

Table 4 -- Use case for tracking and notification 

Title Analyst Use Case for viewing track information 

Description This use case illustrates the subscription for track data, display 
of track data in a mapping client, accessing the track metadata 
and retrieval of imagery evidence to illustrate and confirm the 
track information.  

Actors: ISR analyst, UAV controller 

Trigger: Earthquake occurs and tracking data is required for a bridge 
area to confirm or deny traffic flow. 

Preconditions:  WPS and client have access to WFS and SOS 
 WFS is available that has STANAG 4676 Track data 

model 
 SOS is available that can support storage and retrieval 



OGC 11-134 

42 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

of VMTI frame and detection information 
 WPS is available to analyze data for tracks 
 Notifications can be sent from WFS to client 

Post conditions:  Track data is displayed to the user 
 Track evidence is retrieved from the SOS and is 

displayed to the user 

Basic Flow (Steps): 1. Analyst logs in to portal 
2. Analyst requests UAV to survey area. 
3. UAV is tasked to survey area. 
4. UAV film is uploaded to SOS 
5. WPS is invoked to create track data 
6. Analyst discovers Track WFS using catalog. 
7. Analyst subscribes to Track WFS by drawing area of 

interest on map.  
8. WPS inserts discovered tracks into WFS 
9. Client receives notification from WFS. 
10. Client retrieves track data from WFS. 
11. Client displays track data on the map. 
12. Analyst invokes dialog to display track metadata for 

selected track. 
13. Client displays imagery evidence retrieved from SOS. 
14. Imagery evidence shows tracked object which is 

highlighted using metadata retrieved from SOS. 

Notes None 

 

Figure 20 -- Client use of services illustrates how the client software uses the WFS and 
the SOS to visualize tracking data. The user is provided with a dialog that displays track 
data from a WFS track point feature. The track point contains relevant metadata that can 
be used by an analyst. Additionally, the feature contains a link to the video evidence for 
that derived track point. It is important to note that the point has been developed from the 
detection and video information and will not have a direct correspondence to the 
detections available from the SOS. 

The evidence does contain a link to the frame image that corresponds to the point in time 
for the track point. Using this time stamp information and the frame information itself, 



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 43 
 

the client retrieves frame metadata such as footprint quadrilateral, frame height and 
width. These are used with track point geographic position to plot the track point on the 
frame image itself. 

Because all track points are available from the WFS, the analyst can flip back and forth 
between frames and see the plotting of track points over frame imagery to determine the 
accuracy of the track and the visual properties of the tracked feature. 

 

 

Figure 20 -- Client use of services 

 

Figure 21 -- Track Display Using a WMS provides a screenshot of the analyst interface 
showing a track developing along a road. The dot indicates the latest known track point 
and the brown line indicates the known geometry of the track. Clicking on the track will 
invoke the dialog illustrated in Figure 22 -- Track Point Interface. In that figure, we 
can see frame imagery, metadata for the latest point and Next and Previous buttons that 
allow the Analyst to view track points, their metadata and associated frame imagery. The 
track point itself is plotted on the frame imagery. This is illustrated in Figure 23 -- 
Frame Image with highlighted Detection.

10.2 GeoSMS notification 

As part of  OWS-8, notification was supported using a brokering system that would relay 
WFS notifications to mobile clients as GeoSMS messages. These messages would 
contain enough information to orient the receiver geographically and enable the receiver 
to retrieve track information directly from the WFS.  In order to accomplish this, there 
are 2 stages in the notification process. The first is the registration of the client with the 
notification broker. The broker sits between the client (mobile device) and the 
notification producer (WFS) and specializes in subscribing to the producer in a generic 
way, but relaying any notifications from the producer in a client-specific manner. In the 
OWS-8 scenario, the broker received data from the WFS in XML SOAP messages, but 
relayed the data as GeoSMS messages. 

Clients register with the broker using the WSN-T SOAP protocol. This allows the client 
to register their event subscription information and an address for notifications to be 
relayed to the client in this case SMS or email endpoints.  



OGC 11-134 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 47 
 

 

Figure 24 - Subscribing to a Broker 

The broker takes this information and retains it for communication back to the client 
when notifications arrive. Clients are provided a unique identifier which is used for 
reference when the notification arrives. The broker then forwards the subscription 
information to the Subscription Manager in a format that the WFS can make use of. A 
subscription to a broker might be a high level representation of a filter by AOI and 
feature type, but the broker has the responsibility to encode this subscription as a WSN 
Filter which is usable by the WFS.  



OGC 11-134 

48 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

Figure 25 - Subscription from Broker to Subscription Manager 

When notifications match a client subscription at the WFS, the broker will match the 
notification to a particular client. This will allow the broker to identify the endpoint, 
protocol and format used to forward the notification to the client e.g. a phone number , 
SMS and an appropriate GeoSMS message.

Figure 26 -- Notification Process 

 The process for registering with the broker and the subsequent WFS notifications is 
illustrated in Figure 26 -- Notification Process.  

10.3 Mobile Client Implementation 

The Mobile Client is an Android-based application which supports the OGC GeoSMS 1.0 
standard and is capable of handling WFS features and KML files. Once the mobile client 
receives a GeoSMS, the URL is decoded to retrieve the WFS track feature. The url to the 
WFS feature is an encoded tinyURL url to the GetFeature request. The application uses 
the Google Maps interface to display the track.
