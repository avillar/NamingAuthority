 FedEO Pilot Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

The OGC Interoperability Program (IP) is a global, innovative, collaborative, hands-on 

engineering and testing program designed to define, document, and test draft 

specifications or enhancements to existing OpenGIS specifications and to communicate 

the results of the initiative work to the OGC Technical Committee. 

The primary purpose of OGC‘s IP is to bring Sponsors and Participants together in rapid, 

hands-on, collaborative engineering efforts to achieve one or more of the following 

objectives: 

o Produce and test Candidate Implementation Specifications for geoprocessing 
interoperability; 

o Perform research on the use of another IT information technology standard in 
terms of that standards relevance and ability to help solve geospatial 

interoperability problems; 

o Develop and test prototype interoperable infrastructure based on those 
specifications; 

o Demonstrate the work performed during a given initiative. 

Interoperability initiatives are the primary programmatic vehicle of the OGC-IP. They are 

designed to be cooperative activities among sponsors, participants, and the IP Team, but 

most particularly among participants representing various member organizations. Such 

collaborative activities are composed of work items supported by designated work groups 

consisting of at least three to five participating organizations that are participating in the 

various relevant initiatives. This approach provides a means to rapidly develop and 

prototype specifications for the insertion into specification process in a way that 

considers various points of view, requirements, and objectives. 

The Federated Earth Observations (FedEO) Pilot was conducted in conjunction with and 

support of the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP). The FedEO pilot used 

and extended the GEOSS AIP Architecture with additional services, e.g, Product 

Programming, Service Orchestration, Processing Services, Orthorectification and 

Reprojection Services and Order Service. 

The objectives of this Engineering Report, which is one of the two main outputs of the 

OGC IP Pilot with the demonstrative video (http://www.ogcnetwork.net/AIPdemos), are 

to address for consideration by the TC some requirements, Engineering Specifications,

Testing Approach and Results, Compliance Test Design and obviously lessons learned 

and the next steps envisaged. 

1.1 Scope 

The Federated Earth Observation Missions (FedEO) Pilot provides a broad international 

venue for operational prototyping and demonstration of Earth Observation (EO) 

requirements and protocols as defined by the European Space Agency (ESA) , together 

with other space agencies (ASI, CNES, CSA, DLR) and users (EUSC) and by other OGC 

members. The FedEO Pilot applies and refines OGC specifications relevant to EO.  The 

FedEO Pilot tests and validates OGC specifications in a business context, and provides 

feedback regarding their ability to improve access to and application of earth observation 

data and services.  This Pilot is sponsored by ESA. 

The FedEO Pilot will test and validate OGC specifications and profiles proposed in the 

context of ESA‘s Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility project to improve access to and 

application of Earth Observation data and services. 

The FedEO pilot will offer a persistent service support and protocol demonstration and 

testing environment based on the ESA‘s Service Support Environment. 

The FedEO Pilot will focus on refining the following Implementation Specifications and 

other OGC documents: 

o Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) for EO Collection and Service 
Discovery 

o Catalogue Service CSW ebRIM Earth Observation and ISO extension 
packages  

o Web Map Services - Application Profile for EO Products  

o Sensor Planning Service for EO Sensors  

o GML Application schema for Earth Observation products 

o Improvements to Ordering Services for Earth Observation Products 

Several of these documents have been developed within ESA‘s Heterogeneous Mission 

Accessibility (HMA) project which was started in the framework of the Global 

Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) Preparatory activities. The purpose of 

the HMA effort was to define the interoperability requirements across the ground 

segments of the European and Canadian missions which will contribute to the GMES 

initial phase.  Consistent with HMA, the FedEO Pilot results will contribute to the Global 

Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS). Furthermore, the interoperability 

framework of the FedEO Pilot will allow harmonised access to the national and Eumetsat 

missions.  

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 

the subject of patent rights. The OGC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or 

all such patent rights.

5 Geospatial Architecture Implementation Pilot and FedEO 

The OGC GEOSS AIP initiative was created in order to reach consensus on architectural 

elements that initiatives supporting geospatial information systems can carry forward into 

operations, thereby increasing the overall level of interoperability. It‘s objectives was to 

identify components with services (e.g. portals, catalogues…), to participate in 

conforming the interoperability of those identified services using standards and 

interoperability arrangements as identified in the architecture of the call for participants, 

and, participate in the collaborative development of societal benefit scenarios to guide 

testing and demonstrations of the identified interoperable services. 

The OGC GEOSS AIP initiative was initiated to solicit response to the GEOSS 

Architecture Implementation Pilot, which aims to incorporate contributed components 

consistent with the GEOSS Architecture - using a GEOSS Web Portal and a GEOSS 

Clearinghouse search facility –to access services through GEOSS Interoperability 

Arrangements in support of the GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas. The GEO Task AR-07-

02 will conduct this pilot consistent with the request of the GEO Plenary.  

FedEO Pilot and the Tri-Lateral Interoperability PilotTwo have offered their 

collaboration with GEOSS by providing a broad assessment of capabilities and 

opportunities to address interoperability on a broad scale

5.1 GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot 

The high-level objectives of this Pilot are:  

1. To develop persistent demonstrations of end-user benefits of the contributed systems 
that interoperates using open standards. 

2. To increase interoperability between the information systems and the associated 
services of the participating organizations, and  

3. To advance the state of implementation of geospatial interoperability using open 
standards, in particular for Earth Observation data and information. 

The GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot task aims to incorporate contributed 

components consistent with the GEOSS Architecture - using a GEOSS Web Portal and a 

GEOSS Clearinghouse search facility – or order to access services through GEOSS 

Interoperability Arrangements in support of the GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas.   This 

pilot is GEO Task AR-07-02 conducted by the GEO Architecture and Data Committee.  

5.2 Tri-Lateral Pilot (Section merges inputs from Doug and Ioannis) 

The organizations responsible for national and regional "Spatial Data Infrastructures" in 

Europe (INSPIRE), Canada (GeoConnections), and the U.S. (FGDC) signed a tri-lateral 

arrangement document in January 2006 to formalize collaboration on applied geospatial 

standardization in an international context.  

The Tri-Lateral Interoperability Pilot is a collaborative, open standards development, 

supporting collective requirements of governments with the knowledge and capabilities 

of academic, commercial, and non-commercial solutions providers. This pilot is 

sponsored by FGDC. 

Participation in this Pilot invited the contribution of standards-based services that can be 

catalogued and accessed to support multiple international interests. The pilot builds on 

existing components addressing issues of desertification, land use and land cover change, 

deforestation, forest fires, hydrological resources and modelling, and resulting pressures 

on ecosystems and biodiversity made interoperable through the GEOSS architecture to 

provide support to decision-makers in Africa. Technical objectives of this pilot 

include tests of distributed access to catalogues' contents and protocols with particular 

interest into OGC Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) catalogues i.e. ebRIM and ISO 

19115/19119 and service registries i.e. UDDI and OASIS ebRS access.  The WMS and 

WFS services will also be part of the Tri-Lateral Pilot. 

5.3 Common Architectural Context 

While each of the Pilots has its own objectives, there is a high degree of commonality of 

the architecture of the pilots. An aim of the collaborative Pilot is to reach consensus on 

architectural elements that initiatives in support of geospatial information systems can 

carry forward into operations, thereby increasing the overall level of interoperability.

The common architecture is based on the current ―mainstream‖ approach to service 

oriented architecture (SOA) and was selected to provide the best opportunity for meeting 

the Pilot requirements. This architecture is not intended to determine the physical system 

configuration, but to identify the interfaces and protocols within the current mainstream 

SOA.

6 Process of the FedEO Architectural Design 

The Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (ISO/IEC 10746-1:1998) is an 

international standard for architecting open, distributed processing systems. It provides an 

overall conceptual framework for building distributed systems in an incremental manner. 

The RM-ODP standards have been widely adopted: they constitute the conceptual basis 

for the ISO 19100 series of geomatics standards (normative references in ISO 

19119:2005), and they also have been employed in the OMG object management 

architecture. 

The RM-ODP approach has been used in the design of the OpenGIS Reference Model 

(OGC 2003) with respect to the following two aspects: 

o It constitutes a way of thinking about architectural issues in terms of 
fundamental patterns or organizing principles, and 

o It provides a set of guiding concepts and terminology. 

Systems resulting from the RM-ODP approach (called Open Distributed Processing 

systems, i.e.ODP systems) are composed of interacting objects whereby in RMODP an 

object is a representation of an entity in the real world. It contains information and offers 

services. 

Based on this understanding of a system, ISO/IEC 10746 specifies an architectural 

framework for structuring the specification of ODP systems in terms of the concepts of 

viewpoints and viewpoint specifications, and distribution transparencies. 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 9 
 

The viewpoints identify the top priorities for architectural specifications and provide a 

minimal set of requirements—plus an object model—to ensure system integrity. They 

address different aspects of the system and enable the ‗separation of concerns‘. 

Five standard viewpoints are defined: 

o The enterprise viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment 
that focuses of the purpose, scope and policies for the system. 

o The information viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment 
that focuses on the semantics of the information and information processing 

performed. 

o The computational viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its 
environment that enables distribution through functional decomposition of the 

system into objects which interact at interfaces. 

o The engineering viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment 
that focuses on the mechanisms and functions required to support distributed 

interaction between objects in the system. 

o The technology viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment 
that focuses on the choice of technology in that system. 

The aspect of a distributed ODP system is handled by the concept of distribution 

transparency. Distribution transparency relates to the masking from applications of the 

details and the differences in mechanisms used to overcome problems caused by 

distribution. According to the RM-ODP, application designers simply select which 

distribution transparencies they wish to assume and where in the design they are to apply. 

The RM-ODP distinguishes between eight distribution transparency types. These 

distribution transparencies consider aspects of object access, failure of objects, location 

of objects, as well as replication, migration, relocation, persistence and transactional 

behaviour of objects. 

An RM-ODP-based approach has been selected for the design of the FedEO Architecture 

as the primary objectives of RM-ODP like: 

o support for aspects of distributed processing, 

o provision of interoperability across heterogeneous systems, and 

o hiding consequences of distribution to systems developers 

are largely coherent with the FedEO objectives. However, as FedEO architectures have 

the characteristic of a loosely-coupled network of systems and services instead of a 

―distributed processing system based on interacting objects‖, the RM-ODP concepts are 

not followed literally. 



OGC 07-152 

10 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

The usage of RM-ODP for the FedEO Architectural design process focuses on the 

structuring of ideas and the documentation of the FedEO Architecture. Thus, a mapping 

of the RM-ODP viewpoints to the FedEO needs has been applied and summarised as 

follow: 

o The enterprise viewpoint is concerned with the purpose, scope and policies 
governing the activities of the specified system within the organization of 

which it is a part. This viewpoint is intended to end users and stakeholder 

readership. 

o The information viewpoint specifies the modelling of all categories of 
information the FedEO architecture deals with including their thematic, 

spatial, temporal characteristics as well as their metadata. 

o The computational viewpoint referred to as ―Service Viewpoint‖. It specifies 
the FedEO services that support the syntactical and semantic interoperability 

between ground systems, clients and FedEO components. These two last 

viewpoints are intended to analysts‘ readership. 

o The technology viewpoint specifies the technological choices of the service 
infrastructure and the operational issues of the infrastructure. 

o The engineering viewpoint specifies the mapping of the FedEO service 
specifications and information models to chosen service and information 

infrastructure. These two last viewpoints are intended to analyst and 

developers readerships. 

7 Enterprise Viewpoint : 

The enterprise viewpoint of FedEO is concerned with the business activities of the 

subject federated earth observation environment also known as SSE (Service Support 

Environment). These activities can be represented by two sets of use cases related to 

respectively the end-user of services and the service provider (or service owner). 

End-users benefit from this environment as it brings together distributed EO products and 

EO data offered by multiple service providers. Via this access points (accessible from 

distributed Web Portals or from service registries or catalogues), the end-user can more 

easily discover services matching his exact requirements. This discovery is facilitated by 

the thematic and local distribution of FedEO Services. EO product, data collection and 

service catalogues for multiple missions of different satellite operators are offered within 

a distributed environment and are linked with data access, programming, ordering and 

processing services hereby offering a one-stop solution for users of EO services.  

The environment empowers service providers by offering them the possibility to 

advertise and integrate their new and existing services within thus one stop Portals for EO 

data and EO products. Their simple or chained services would be promoted and provided 

to different level (local and thematic) Portals depending on the characteristic of the 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 11 
 

services. The distributed portals are provided with cost-effective tools based on open 

standards allowing them to publish and manage their services as well as monitor their use 

whilst keeping control over the services backend on their local infrastructure. These 

services can be combined with other services that may possibly be provided by third 

parties hereby facilitating the definition of advanced value-adding products on EO 

imagery by distributing the processing steps over different specialists. Service providers 

can offer these services via the Portals pages or via a machine-to-machine ―data access 

integration layer‖ allowing discovery of their services via a virtual service and 

data/products registry or catalogue. 

 

Figure 2 : Portals distributed network 

The enterprise viewpoint thus addresses following high level objectives:  

- provide a neutrally managed overarching distributed infrastructure enabling the 
interactions among products and data providers, service providers and with end-

users,  

- permit service interaction whilst avoiding the service de-localisation (i.e. services 
remain on the service provider infrastructure), 

- allow easy publishing and orchestration of synchronous and asynchronous EO 
services for online and offline processes,  

- allow chaining of services into more complex ones,  

- support ―subscription‖ type services and standing orders (e.g. fires active 
monitoring and alerting),  

- support the evolution and maintenance of services, 

- allow easy identification of, and access to requested services and products, with 
progress follow-up until completion,  



OGC 07-152 

12 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

- integrate services from multiple domains, e.g. geospatial, meteorological, in-situ, 
to exploit multi-domain synergies, 

- allow services/data providers to register, provide and promote their products to 
thematic or local portals, 

- minimise service provider investments by building on open standards. 

The objective of this FedEO architecture is to demonstrate the benefits of the protocols 

proposed in the technological viewpoint below with multiple scenarios. This will allow 

the services to be deployed as depicted in the bellowing  

Figure 2 : global, regional and national with thematic scales.  

The following services will be involved in the FedEO architecture: 

- Collection and service catalogue discovery, 

- Catalogue search service, 

- Product Programming and Order, 

- Online Data Access, 

- Satellite Multicast Service, 

- Orthorectification and re-projection services, 

- Service Orchestration 

Supported by a lower level services for: 

- User Management 

8 Information Viewpoint : 

The information viewpoint describes the information that flows in a system and is 

processed by a system. It focuses on the structuring of semantic information, typically the 

information that are stored in a database and communicated between the components 

(services and clients) of a system. Hence this chapter deals with the modelling of the data 

FedEO has to manage, namely: 

o Service & collection metadata (for Discovery services); 

o Product metadata (for Catalogue service); 

o Order, programming and subscription (for Order & Programming services); 

o User Profile and authorization metadata (for User Management service); 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 13 
 

o Web map, coverage and feature services (for Online Data Access) 

o Workflow and Business Process (for Service Orchestration) 

These data items are described in the following sub-sections. 

8.1 Features, coverages, observations and maps 

The starting point for modeling of geographic information is the geographic feature. A 

feature is an abstraction of a real world phenomenon. A geographic feature is a feature 

associated with a location relative to the Earth. A digital representation of the real world 

can be thought of as a set of features. 

Any feature may have a number of properties that may be operations, attributes or 

associations. Any feature may have a number of attributes, some of which may be 

geometric and spatial. A feature is not defined in terms of a single geometry, but rather as 

a conceptually meaningful object within a particular domain of discourse, one or more of 

whose properties may be geometric. 

Geographic phenomena fall into two broad categories, discrete and continuous.  Discrete 

phenomena are recognizable objects that have relatively well-defined boundaries or 

spatial extent. Examples include buildings, streams, and measurement stations.  

Continuous phenomena vary over space and have no specific extent. Examples include 

temperature, soil composition, and elevation. A value or description of a continuous 

phenomenon is only meaningful at a particular position in space (and possibly time). 

Temperature, for example, takes on specific values only at defined locations, whether 

measured or interpolated from other locations. 

These concepts are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many components of the landscape 

may be viewed alternatively as discrete or continuous. For example, a stream is a discrete 

entity, but its flow rate and water quality index vary from one position to another. 

Similarly, a highway can be thought of as a feature or as a collection of observations 

measuring accidents or traffic flow, and an agricultural field is both a spatial object and a 

set of measurements of crop yield through time. 

Standardized conceptual schemas for spatial and temporal characteristics increase the 

ability to share geographic information among applications. These schemas are used by 

geographic information system and software developers and users of geographic 

information to provide consistently understandable spatial data structures. 

A coverage is a feature that associates positions within a bounded space (its 

spatiotemporal domain) to feature attribute values (its range). Examples include a raster 

image, a polygon overlay, or a digital elevation matrix. Commonly used spatiotemporal 

domains include point sets, grids, collections of closed rectangles, and other collections 

of geometric objects.  The range of a coverage is a set of feature attribute values.  The 

attributes of a coverage, i.e., its range, are homogeneous across its domain. A Geographic 

imagery scene is a coverage whose range values quantitatively describe physical 

phenomena. 



OGC 07-152 

14 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

An observation is an event with a result which has a value describing some phenomenon.  

The observation event is modelled as a Feature within the context of the General Feature 

Model [ISO 19101, ISO 19109]. An observation feature binds a result to a feature of 

interest, upon which the observation was made. The observed property is a property of 

the feature of interest. An observation uses a procedure to determine the value of the 

result, which may involve a sensor or observer, analytical procedure, simulation or other 

numerical process.  

A map is a portrayal of geographic information.  While a map may be a digital image file 

suitable for display on a computer screen, a map is not the data itself.  

GEOSS components utilize discrete features, coverages, observations and maps.  Satellite 

imagery is a coverage and may be processed in to specific discrete features, e.g., hot spot 

points from a thermal-band image.  Coverages and discrete Features are both need to 

support decision making by Societal Benefit Areas. 

8.2 Spatial referencing 

Spatial Referencing is accomplished is several ways including  

o Terminology with spatial reference 

o Coordinate reference systems 

Many terms refer to locations near the surface of the earth, e.g., identifiers and place 

names.  Spatial referencing with identifiers is when an identifier uniquely indicates a 

location, e.g., a postal code. Place names may be ambiguous, e.g, Springfield, requiring 

additional information to be resolved into a specific location. Gazetteers and geocoding 

are used to resolve the ambiguity. 

Coordinates are unambiguous only when the coordinate reference system to which those 

coordinates are related has been fully defined. A coordinate reference system is a 

coordinate system that has a reference to the Earth. A coordinate reference system 

consists of a coordinate system and a datum. Types of coordinate reference systems 

include: geocentric, geographic (including an ellipsoid), projected, engineering, image, 

vertical, temporal. The datum defines the origin, orientation and scale of the coordinate 

system and ties it to the earth, ensuring that the abstract mathematical concept 

―coordinate system‖ can be applied to the practical problem of describing positions of 

features on or near the earth‘s surface by means of coordinates.  Thousands of coordinate 

reference systems have been defined for various applications.  The World Geodetic 

System (WGS) defines a coordinate reference system that is used with Earth Observation 

data. frame for the earth, for use in geodesy and navigation. The latest revision is 

WGS 84. 

8.3 Collection Metadata 

A dataset collection is a set of catalogue entries having a common set of characteristics. 

For the EO products, collections are generally associated to mission sensors and 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 15 
 

operation mode, e.g. a collection of all the TerraSAR-X spotlight mode data. The 

collection metadata describes these sets by providing the identifier, the description, the 

possible geographical and temporal extent, the common attributes, etc. 

The metadata for collection has been modelled following the ISO 19115 standard. 

8.4 Service Metadata 

This is Human readable service metadata about available Earth Observation related 

services. It provides users sufficient information to assess and to access these services. 

Whereas the metadata stored in the UDDI registry provides standard web-service 

discovery metadata used for example for service orchestration, this service discovery 

metadata is more tailored to the Earth Observation needs, e.g. it is in charge of answering 

questions like: finding an order service allowing ordering products of a specified 

collection; finding a Web Coverage Service returning products of a specific collection; 

etc. 

This metadata is defined by identifying the minimum set of elements of the ISO 19119 

Service Metadata which are sufficient for discovering the FedEO services. 

The following concepts have to be represented in this Service Metadata: 

o Services are defined by: 

o Identification info (e.g. contact information, usage restrictions, region/time 
period of applicability, etc.); 

o Operations and related parameters 

o Dependencies (i.e. how operations depend on results of other operations); 

o Data metadata may be subject to restrictions and therefore 

o not visible for each user of the catalogue service 

o Access control not handled by the catalogue service natively 

8.5 Product Metadata 

This is the metadata used for describing the products derived by earth observation 

satellites that are managed by the Catalogue service of the FedEO architecture. 

o Earth observation satellite products are mainly characterised by the following 
attributes: 

o satellite and sensor acquiring the data; 

o the time when the data has been acquired; 



OGC 07-152 

16 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

o the geographical coverage of the acquired data; 

o the ground station receiving the satellite downlink; 

o other attributes depending on the type of sensor: 

o for radar sensors possible relevant attributes are: polarization, Doppler 
frequency, swath identifier; 

o for optical sensors possible relevant attributes are: cloud coverage, the 
illumination angles; 

o for atmospheric sensors possible specific attributes are: vertical coverage, 
specy; 

From user point of view the main characteristic of Earth Observation products is their 

geographical coverage and then, because GML provides a rich set of definitions for 

representing geographic objects, the representation of Earth Observation products is 

performed through GML application schemas. 

Earth observation products are modelled with the EarthObservationProductType type 

which is an extension of GML AbstractFeatureType type. Because different product 

types derived by different type of sensors have different set of specific attributes, then the 

following approach has been followed: 

o a namespace including definitions common to all sensors has been defined: 
eop 

o a separated namespace for each class of sensor has been defined: 

o sar for radar sensors 

o opt for optical sensors 

o atm for atmospheric sensors 

o other namespaces can be defined for other classes of sensors 

o additional specific namespaces can be defined on top of previous ones. 

The EarthObservationProductType is defined in each namespace by extending the 

definition in the parent namespace leading to this hierarchy:

Figure 3 : EarthObservationProduct type hierarchy. 

The ―eop‖ metadata element names have been harmonized with ISO 19115 (ISO 19139 

schemas) and ISO 19115 Part II draft as far as possible.  The catalogue profile (and GML 

application schemas) allows extension of this layered structure in order to complement 

the optical layer for a specific "atmospheric" mission, which would require additional 

mission specific metadata or queryables. 

Because a Catalogue compliant with this definition can return different 

EarthObservationProduct element format depending on the supported schema, then the 

catalogue allows the clients to get first the list of supported schemas (either eop, opt, sar, 

or other ones defined on them) and then access the metadata at the level in the hierarchy 

that best fit their needs when the data is retrieved. 

8.6 User Management Data 

This section deals with the FedEO information items needed for user authentication. 

FedEO user profile is a set of user attributes that describes a FedEO user, whether a 

human or a service entity. The user profile is composed of several attributes, each 

associated with an identity, a source and an authority. The identity is the entity (or 

principal) which is described by the profile. 

The source is the entity that provides the information for the profile item and the 

authority is the entity that verifies and/or maintains the value.

Because the large support of COTS and because the usage from many user and 

organizations, the LDAP V3 has been selected as the mean for modelling and managing 

FedEO user profiles. 

LDAP foresees a hierarchical representation of the stored objects and items and then 

FedEO user profile are represented by sub-trees of LDAP hierarchy. 

The FedEO Clearinghouse stores all user information in an LDAP v3 registry and can 

link to external LDAP as far as the user information is stored according to IETF RFC 

2256. Tests were performed with OpenLDAP as well as Oracle OID. 

9 Computational Viewpoint : 

The FedEO architecture uses a Service Oriented Architecture with Web Services to 

define an RM-ODP Computational Viewpoint. It specifies the services that support the 

syntactical and semantic interoperability between the high-level operational services 

waited for the FedEO pilot. The FedEO‘s service oriented architecture shall place no 

restrictions on the granularity of a geospatial (Web) services that can be integrated.  The 

grain size can range from small (for example a component that must be combined with 

others to create a complete business process) to large (for example an application). It is 

envisaged to support two main categories of services: 

o Basic services are limited services running on the service providers‘ local 
infrastructure. Basic services may be requested (ordered) via the Portal's user 

interface, or from within a composite service (or workflow). 

o Composite services are services consisting of a combination of basic services 
or other composite services provided by one or many different service 

providers.  

Another way of dividing services into categories relates to the specific functions 

performed by the service. The following set of specific EO data access services has been 

defined firstly in the scope of the GMES Program but are extended for the FedEO Pilot : 

- Collection and service discovery 

- Catalogue Service 

- Product Programming and Order 

- Online Data Access 

- Processing Services  

- Orthorectification and re-projection services 

- Service Orchestration 



OGC 07-152

An end-user typically uses collection discovery to locate dataset collections meeting the 

needs of his application domain e.g. urban planning, precision farming etc. The service 

discovery services then provides access to the services that operate on these dataset 

collections, e.g. catalogue, ordering, data access or programming services. 

9.1 Service Oriented Architecture 

SOA architecture is popular and widespread because it allows exploitation and reusing of 

existing systems functionality by means of services and it provides interoperability 

among functionality provided by heterogeneous systems and technologies. 

It's an architectural style of building software applications that promotes loose coupling 

between components so that they can be re-used in an easy and cost effective way. Thus, 

it's a new way of building applications with the following characteristics: 

o Services are software components that have published contracts/interfaces; 
these contracts are platform-, language-, and operating-system-independent. 

XML and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) are the enabling 

technologies for SOA, since they are platform-independent standards. 

o Consumers can dynamically discover services. 

o Services are interoperable. 

SOA promotes application assembly because services can be reused by numerous 

consumers. It allows automating of business-process management. Business processes 

may consume and orchestrate these services to achieve the desired functionality. Thus, 

new business processes can be constructed by using existing services. 

SOA Architecture style offers several advantages: 

o Adapt applications to changing technologies. 

o Easily integrate applications with other systems. 

o Leverage existing investments in legacy applications. 

o Quickly and easily create new business processes from existing services. 

What makes SOA so powerful is that it encompasses Web services. These modular, self-

contained components are built on open standards, so they work together without custom 

coding. Since the services share a common protocol, they can communicate with each 

other even though they don‘t share the same language or application platform. Web 

services make individual services available to other systems via a network. 



OGC 07-152 

20 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

 

To make services available to a wider audience, SOA uses the find-bind-execute 

paradigm. Service providers register their services in a public registry, the Service 

Directory. This registry is used by service consumers to find services matching certain 

criteria. The registry provides the service consumer with a contract (an interface) and an 

endpoint address for that service. 

Each component (Web Service) provides a service through a clear and well known 

interface. The WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is the de facto standard for 

XML-based service description. WSDL defines the interface and mechanics of service 

interaction. The WSDL document can be complemented by other service description 

documents to describe these higher level aspects of the Web service. For example, 

business context is described using UDDI data structures in addition to the WSDL 

document. UDDI provides a mechanism for holding descriptions of Web Services. 

Although UDDI is often thought of as a directory mechanism, it also defines a data 

structure standard for representing service description information in XML. WSDLUDDI 

are the contracts to be respected by integrated service providers to join a SOA. Each 

component exposes offered services and is able to discover and exploit services provided 

by other infrastructures. These concepts are the basis to achieve an integrated, 

interoperable and extensible architecture. 

Another advantage of using SOA architecture is the evolution of problematic regarding 

Security, Reliability and Authentication. The distributed nature of this architecture makes 

addressing security concerns a critical factor. New standards have been introduced to 

ensure reliable and secure communications over the network conceived to protect the 

environment based on the SOA architecture. 

Each component is then an independent and de-coupled resource giving its contribution 

to reach the final result. Basic services will be composed in a work flow describing the 

sequence of actions to be taken contacting a number of service providers. Compound 

services are so characterized by a working flow composing basic services into an 

interoperability chain. A ―Work-Flow Manager‖ agent is introduced to handle the basic 

services cooperation. Each ―superservice‖ is related to a work flow describing the 

succession of invoked basic services in order to furnish the final result to the end user.

9.2 Collections discovery services 

This service provides a set of functionalities for the user/operator or for applications to 

insert, search and retrieve structured information on the collections offered as part of the 

FedEO architecture. 

This service is used for storing metadata of data set collections that can be accessed via 

catalogue/order or subscriptions. 

9.3 Services discovery services 

This service provides a set of functionalities for the user/operator or for applications to 

search and retrieve structured information on the 

―Human Readable Services‖ offered as part of the FedEO architecture. 

9.4 Catalogue Services 

The Catalogue service provides a set of functionalities for the user/operator to search and 

retrieve metadata and browse images for the catalogued EO products from the missions 

being part of the FedEO infrastructure. 

This service allows user/operator to find the EO products matching their needs. 

Catalogue searches can specify: 

o The collection (e.g. Envisat_ASAR, ERS_SAR, etc) 

o The area of interest (e.g. one or more rectangles / circles / polygons) 

o The time windows of interest 

o Mission specific parameters e.g. orbit, pass direction, swath, track number, 
frame number, etc. 

o Specific criteria (e.g. Cloud cover, snow cover, polarization etc.) 

As explained within the information viewpoint, these product metadata vary depending 

on the type of mission: optical, radar or atmospheric. 

Note that some EO catalogues contain entries for future planned and potential (i.e. 

products predictable through orbit swath propagation) products. 

The access to a catalogue service is subject to user authorization. 

9.5 Product Programming services 

The programming service provides a set of functionalities for the user/operator to: 

o Perform feasibility analysis of EO future products i.e. to check whether the 
request can be fulfilled considering the satellite and sensor characteristic, 



OGC 07-152 

22 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

meteorological conditions and mission workload. The analysis can be 

performed at different level of accuracy. 

o Issue future EO products requests 

The programming service supports the following 3 types of requests: 

o Order of precisely identified future products. This type of orders are 
referenced as Acquisition Orders; 

o Order asking the coverage of specified area in a specified time window. This 
type of orders are referenced as Coverage Orders; 

o Same as the previous one, but the coverage is repeated several times with a 
defined periodicity. 

A request to the Programming Service is generally referred to ―Programming Request‖. 

An order for future products is referred to ―task‖. 

This service allows the clients to perform the following activities: 

o Retrieval of the programming parameters related to the specified product / 
sensor; 

o Definition of the programming request and checking the feasibility; 

o Submission of the programming request; 

o Programming request status monitoring; 

o Possible cancellation of the submitted request; 

o Issuing of status notification. 

o Retrieval of acquired data. 

In order to autonomously accomplish the feasibility analysis, the service has to receive / 

harvest satellite/sensor characteristics. The parameters are received via files or are 

harvested by calling DescribeSensor operation implemented by GS Programming 

Services. 

9.6 Order services 

This service provides a set of functionalities for the user/operator to place orders for the 

catalogued EO products and for adhere to subscriptions from the missions being part of 

the FedEO infrastructure. 

This service allows the clients to perform the following activities: 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 23 
 

o Get the service capabilities: retrieval of the supported version, the supported 
operations, etc. 

o Order options retrieval (scene selection options, processing options, media 
definition, subscription sub-setting, etc.). 

o Order Quotation: for getting a quotation of the order going to be submitted. 

o Order submission 

o Order monitor: to check the status of submitted orders. 

o Order Cancellation: to cancel an on-going order. 

o Retrieval of on-line available products. 

During the order execution the user can query the status of his / her orders or also cancel 

the orders. 

The services should verify any constraints that may be imposed on users, and report 

status and relevant information back to the user 

9.7 Online Data Access services 

Various on-line data access services provide access to ordered datasets via the Internet. 

Such services typically use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for allowing access to EO 

data, but also more advanced methods such as OGC Web Services for data delivery and 

visualization: Web Coverage Services (WCS), Web Map Services (WMS), Web Feature 

Services (WFS) and Sensor Observation Services (SOS). 

9.7.1 Files Transfer Protocol 

FTP or File Transfer Protocol from IETF is used to transfer data from one computer to 

another over the Internet, or through a network. 

Specifically, FTP is a commonly used protocol for exchanging files over any network 

that supports the TCP/IP protocol (such as the Internet or an intranet). 

9.7.2 OGC Web Map Service 

An OGC Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data 

dynamically from geographic information. This international standard defines a "map" to 

be a portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a 

computer screen. 

A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial 

format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in 

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) 



OGC 07-152 

24 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

formats. This is in contrast to a Web Coverage Service (WCS), which returns actual 

raster data. 

WMS defines three operations: 

o GetCapabilities, which returns service-level metadata. 

o GetMap, which returns a map whose geographic and dimensional parameters 
are well-defined. 

o GetFeatureInfo, which returns information about particular features shown on 
a map (optional). 

9.7.3 OGC Web Coverage Service 

The Web Coverage Service is an Open Geospatial Consortium standard web service for 

exchanging geospatial raster data. 

WCS provides available data together with their detailed descriptions; allows complex 

queries against these data; and returns data with its original semantics (instead of 

pictures) which can be interpreted, extrapolated, etc. -- and not just portrayed. This is in 

contrast to a Web Map Service (WMS) which produces a digital image file. 

WCS provides three operations: 

o GetCapabilities, which returns XML document describing the data collections 
available via WCS. 

o DescribeCoverage, which returns details about a specified data collection. 

o GetCoverage, which returns the data in a well known format. 

9.7.4 OGC Web Feature Service 

The Web Feature Service is an Open Geospatial Consortium standard web service for 

defining interfaces for data access and manipulation operations on geographic features 

using HTTP as the distributed computing platform. Via these interfaces, a web user or 

service can combine, use and manage geodata – the feature information behind a map 

image – from different sources by invoking the following WFS operations on geographic 

features and elements : 

o Create a new feature instance, 

o Delete a feature instance, 

o Update a feature instance, 

o Lock a feature instance, 

o Get or query features on spatial and non-spatial constraints. 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 25 
 

9.7.5 OGC Sensor Observation Service 

The Sensor Observation Service in an Open Geospatial Consortium standards web 

service for exchanging sensor observation data. 

9.8 Processing Services 

Earth Observation data will not always be well-suited to a specific purpose and will need 

processing specific to the users needs. This situation is typical in environments were data 

is acquired and archived for one application but this is accessed for by a user with a 

different application than the original application. 

Extensive tests have been performed as well within the ESA Grid infrastructure leading 

to a preliminary definition of a Grid-based Processing Service. This with the objective of 

reducing the burden caused by the transfer of large EO coverages by transferring instead 

the processing algorithms on the Grid that hosts within its storage element the coverages 

to be processed. 

The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) defines a standardized interface that facilitates 

the publishing of geospatial processes, and the discovery of and binding to thse processes 

by clients. ―Processes‖ include any algorithm, calculation or model that operates on 

spatially referenced data. ―Publishing‖ means making available machine-readable 

binding information as well as human-readable metadata that allows service discovery 

and use. 

9.9 Orthorectification and re-projection services 

Ortho-rectification and re-projection of remote sensing images is an important issue for 

various applications. Indeed, the image orthorectification and re-projection process 

combines relief effects corrections and geo-referencing with high location accuracy. 

The OGC Web Coordinate Transformation Service (WCTS) is another processing service 

that was experimented with, in combination with Spot Image Web Coverage Service as 

described within OWS-3 Imagery Workflow experiments. 

9.10 Services Orchestration 

This service allows designing and executing compound services. A compound service is 

defined by a workflow describing it in term of interactions among simple and / or 

compound services already defined. This is similar to defining a normal service. It means 

that you need to define the interface and to provide the definitions to implement that 

interface.  

The services orchestration is implemented using BPEL (Business Process Execution 

Language) for most of the services which are part of the Clearinghouse.       

The workflow engine is the component executing the workflows within a Service-

Oriented Architecture.  It executes business processes based on the Business Process 



OGC 07-152 

26 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

Execution Language for Web Services - BPEL standard.    The workflow engine is 

implemented with the Oracle BPEL Process Manager.

Figure 4 : Service orchestration for distributed catalogue access. 

The Service orchestration supports both synchronous and asynchronous services. An 

interesting example of a synchronous service is the product cross-catalogue search 

service. It allows simultaneous access to various (federated) catalogue services via a 

single "virtual" catalogue service. 

The BPEL process implementing the GetRecords operation of the service accesses 

multiple catalogues in parallel and returns the combined search results to the Portal.   The  

distributed catalogue search approach is to start a search from the Clearinghouse and to 

search federated catalogues with the same set of attributes. Federated catalogues are 

selected based on collection ID or ParentIdentifier. 

Other applications of service orchestration implement access via composite services to 

ordering and programming services of multiple satellite ground segments. 

 

10 Engineering Viewpoint : 

This viewpoint specifies the mapping of the service specifications and information 

models to the chosen service and information infrastructure. The FedEO server at ESA is 

based on the Service Support Environment (SSE) ones which provide a reusable service 

oriented architecture for the integration of services in the Earth Observation (EO) and 

geospatial domains. More details are available at

10.3 Order Service 

This metadata covers the needs of EO products ordering and subscriptions. The main 

information items related to products are : 

o Order Options 

o Product Order 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 29 
 

o Subscription 

The structure of abov items is outlined in the UML models reported hereafter. 

10.3.1 Order Options (to be update with inputs from the last HMA architecture TN) 

 

Figure 8 : Order Option structure. 

Order options specify all possible valid combinations of options for ordering products of 

a specified collection and for adhering to a subscription. 

A single order option instance includes the following attributes: 

o Identifier of the order options group; 

o scene selection options (e.g. possible options for ordering a scene on the 
product). These are not applicable to subscriptions. 

o the list of possible product delivery options (e.g. CD, DVD, electronic, etc.); 

o the list of other options (e.g. for product orders: product level, product format, 
etc; for subscriptions: expiration date, geographical area, etc.). 

10.3.2 Product Order and Subscription 

The order is the data structure sent by user / operator to order products and to adhere to 

subscriptions. 



OGC 07-152 

30 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

 

Figure 9 : Product Order strucutre. 

An order contains the following information: 

o userInformation, identifying the user who submitted the order; 

o orderSpecification, which regroups the following attributes: 

o orderAccount, Account under which the user is authorised to order from 
the specific provider; 

o orderReference, user defined name of the order; 

o orderRemark, textual remark; 

o deliveryInformation, which include FTP / mail (with related deliver 
address); 

o list of orderItem, which include: 

 productId, which identifies the item to order; 

 option: list of user selected options. Several type of options can be 
specified: strings, numbers, enumerated strings, polygon, times. 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 31 
 

 sceneSelection: in case of scene order it identifies the scene on the 
parent product; 

 deliveryMethod, package, quality of service. 

This structure is used for the 2 purposes: product ordering / subscription. The distinction 

is performed by the productId element: if the specified collection reference to a collection 

then the order implies the adhesion to the subscription; if it references an EO product, 

then it is a product order.

The FedEO Clearinghouse contains various clients which allow programming EO sensors 

via the OGC SPS (Sensor Planning Service) interface and in particular its profile for EO 

(OGC 07-018). Such clients were demonstrated as part of OWS-4 (see OGC 07-008), the 

ESA COPS-B project and CoMu. The SWE thread in OWS-5 is expected to build on this 

work and align it with the latest version of the specification 07-018.

10.5 Online data access Services 

Previous experiments with WCS in the framework of OWS-3 are accessible via the SSE 

as described in OGC 07-008.  The FedEO Clearinghouse contains an WCS client 

supporting GEOTIFF. 

Experiments have been performed in the framework of FedEO for on-line data access to 

EO data using OGC WCS and JPEG2000 in cooperation with SPOTIMAGE.  An online 

demonstrator is being finalised which will allow on-line data access to EO data requested 

by a user via an EO Profile for SPS interface (OGC 07-018).  The DescribeResultAccess 

may return the URL to the WCS/JP2 server and a client in the FedEO Clearinghouse will 

allow visualising and downloading part of the product. 

The FedEO Clearinghouse also supports on-line access to data via the OGC SOS (Sensor 

Observation Service).  Various experiments have been performed by the ESA COPS-B 

and EC FP6 SANY projects which have been integrated in the FedEO Clearinghouse 

built on SSE technology.

10.6 Services orchestration 

The service metadata describes the services provided by the SSE and the mission Ground 

Segments. The level of description is such that an application should be able to discover 

and then use the services (e.g. supported operations). For the management of this data the 

usage of a UDDI registry is envisaged. 

The Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) specification describes an 

online electronic registry that serves as electronic Yellow Pages, providing an 

information structure where various business entities register themselves and the services 

they offer through their definitions (e.g. using WSDL). 

The UDDI specification defines a 4-tier hierarchical XML schema that provides a model 

for publishing, validating, and invoking information about Web Services. XML was 

chosen because it offers a platform-neutral view of data and allows hierarchical 

relationships to be described in a natural way. UDDI uses standards-based technologies, 

such as common Internet protocols (TCP/IP and HTTP), XML, and SOAP (a 

specification for using XML in simple message-based exchanges). 

UDDI is a standard Web Service description format and Web Service discovery protocol; 

a UDDI registry can contain metadata for any type of service, with best practices already 

defined for those described by Web Service Description Language (WSDL). 

A UDDI registry consists of the following data structure types: 

o businessEntity - The top-level XML element in a business UDDI entry, it 
captures the data partners require to find information about a business service, 

including its name, industry or product category, geographic location, and 

optional categorization and contact information. It includes support for 

"yellow pages" taxonomies to search for businesses byindustry, product, or 

geography. 

o businessService - The logical child of a businessEntity data structure as well 
as the logical parent of a bindingTemplate structure, it contains descriptive 

business service information about a group of related technical services 

including the group name, a brief description, technical service description 

information, and category information. By organizing Web Services into 

groups assoociated with categories or business processes, UDDI allows more 

efficient search and discovery of Web Services. 

o bindingTemplate - The logical child of a businessService data structure, it 
contains data that is relevant for applications that need to invoke or bind to a 

specific Web Service. This information includes the Web Service URL and 

other information describing hosted services, routing and load balancing 

facilities, and references to interface specifications. 

o tModel - Descriptions of specifications for Web Services or taxonomies that 
form the basis for technical fingerprints; its role is to represent the technical 

specification of the Web Service, making it easier for Web Service consumers 



OGC 07-152 

34 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

to find Web Services that are compatible with a particular technical 

specification. That is, based on the descriptions of the specifications for Web 

Services in the tModel structure, Web Service consumers can easily identify 

other compatible Web Services. For instance, to send a business partner's Web 

Service a purchase order, the invoking service must know not only the 

location/URL of the service, but what format the purchase order should be 

sent in, what protocols are appropriate, what security is required, an what 

form of a response will result after sending the purchase order. 

The information hierarchy and the key XML element names that are used to describe and 

discover information about Web Services are shown in the figure below: 

 

Figure 13 : Service Metadata UDDI model 

Generic services are described via Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 

providing Service Interface Specification and Service Implementation information. A 

WSDL service description contains an abstract definition for a set of operations and 

messages, a concrete protocol binding for these operations and messages, and a network 

endpoint specification for the binding. This represents a reusable definition of a service. 

In order to publish and find Services by means of their WSDL description using UDDI 

the following applies: the Service interface is published in a UDDI registry as a tModel. 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 35 
 

The service implementation describes instances of a service. Each instance is defined 

using a WSDL service element. Each service element in a service implementation 

document is used to publish a UDDI businessService.

11 Technology Viewpoint and Standards : 

This viewpoint describes the components that have been deployed and still are 

operational in the scope of FedEO Pilot. 

For more details on the different components instance deployed for the FedEO scenario, 

please refer to the §13 : Disaster Management / Emergency Response Scenario – Oil Spill 

Tanker. 

11.1 Application of Standards 

In the FedEO architecture a large set of open standards have been used: 

o Service Oriented Design. Due to the SOA approach, the following standards 
have been adopted: 

o XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry 
out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, 

content and semantics of XML documents in more detail. XML Schema is 

used together WSDL for defining the interfaces of FedEO Services. 

o Message-based SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) over HTTP or 
HTTPS for secure communication is used as protocol between the FedEO 

architecture clients and remote GS services. 



OGC 07-152 

36 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

o WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is used to define the 
operations, the SOAP messages, the protocol bindings of the FedEO 

services in a formal way. It is equivalent to a CORBA IDL. 

o The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) from OASIS provides 
a vendor-independent XML-based format to model service workflows. 

The FedEO workflow engine uses this open standard. Software (i.e. 

workflows) developed using this language is thus reusable and the 

workflow engine or workflow editing tool would be replaced. 

o Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI). This standard 
allows for service discovery and is an essential part of a SOA. It defines 

the external interfaces of a Web service registry. Competing standards 

(with less vendor support) are WS-inspection (IBM) and OGC Catalogue 

specification CSW 2.0. 

o Ws-addressing is used to correlate asynchronous message exchanges in a 
standard way instead of an ad-hoc content-based mechanism. Ws-

addressing is standardized by the W3C Consortium. 

o Geospatial, Inspire related and recommended by CEN:  

For the analysis of the spatial data model the following standards have been considered 

o ISO 19109, which contains the general feature model for ISO/TC 211. It 
guides the use of classes, relationships, interfaces, and properties in 

designing feature schemas for data transfers or transactions. 

o ISO/TS 19103 provides rules and guidelines for the use of a conceptual 
schema language within the ISO geographic information standards. It also 

provides a profile of UML (Unified Modelling Language) for use with 

geographic information. UML is the chosen conceptual schema language 

within ISO/TC 211. 

The definition of spatial data encoding has been done following the: 

o ISO 19136 Geography Markup Language (GML). It is an XML grammar 
written in XML Schema for the modelling, transport, and storage of 

geographic information. The key concepts used by GML to model the 

world are drawn from the OpenGIS® Abstract Specification and the ISO 

19100 series. GML provides a variety of kinds of objects for describing 

geography including features, coordinate reference systems, geometry, 

topology, time, units of measure and generalized values. 

For the definition of features spatial data services: 

o The Web Feature Service (WFS) allows a client to retrieve and update 
geospatial data encoded in Geography Markup Language (GML) from 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 37 
 

multiple Web Feature Services. The requirements for a Web Feature 

Service are: 

 The interfaces must be defined in XML. 

 GML must be used to express features within the interface. 

 At a minimum a WFS must be able to present features using GML. 

 The predicate or filter language will be defined in XML and be 
derived from CQL as defined in the OpenGIS Catalogue Interface 

Implementation Specification. 

 The datastore used to store geographic features should be opaque 
to client applications and their only view of the data should be 

through the WFS interface. 

 The use of a subset of XPath expressions for referencing 
properties. 

This standard is relevant for the on-line data access interface. 

For the definition of raster spatial data services: 

o Web Map Service (WMS) standard specifies the behaviour of a service 
that produces spatially referenced maps dynamically from geographic 

information. It specifies operations to retrieve a description of the maps 

offered by a server, to retrieve a map, and to query a server about features 

displayed on a map. This International Standard is applicable to pictorial 

renderings of maps in a graphical format; it is not applicable to retrieval of 

actual feature data or coverage data values. 

This standard is relevant for the on-line data access interface. 

o The Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic interchange of 
geospatial data as "coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information 

representing space-varying phenomena. A WCS provides access to 

potentially detailed and rich sets of geospatial information, in forms that 

are useful for client-side rendering, multi-valued coverages, and input into 

scientific models and other clients. The WCS may be compared to the 

OGC Web Map Ser-vice (WMS) and the Web Feature Service (WFS); 

like them it allows clients to choose portions of a server's information 

holdings based on spatial constraints and other criteria. Unlike WMS, 

which filters and portrays spatial data to return static maps (rendered as 

pictures by the server), the Web Coverage Service provides available data 

together with their detailed descriptions; allows complex queries against 

these data; and returns data with its original semantics (instead of pictures) 

which can be interpreted, extrapolated, etc. -- and not just portrayed. 

Unlike WFS, which returns discrete geospatial features, the Web 



OGC 07-152 

38 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

Coverage Service returns representations of space-varying phenomena that 

relate a spatio-temporal domain to a (possibly multidimensional) range of 

properties. 

This standard is relevant for the on-line data access interface. 

For the definition of spatial data catalogue services: 

o ISO 19119 Services identifies and defines the architecture patterns for 
service interfaces used for geographic information and defines its 

relationship to the Open Systems Environment model. It also presents a 

geographic services taxonomy and a list of example geographic services 

placed in the services taxonomy. 

o ISO 19115 Dataset Series (collection) metadata 

o ISO 19139 XML encoding for ISO 19115/19119 

o OGC CSW2.0 Application Profile ISO19115/19119. This application 
profile specifies the interfaces, bindings, and encodings required to 

publish and access digital catalogues of metadata for geospatial data, 

services, and applications that comply with the given profile. Metadata act 

as generalized properties that can be queried and returned through 

catalogue services for resource evaluation and, in many cases, invocation 

or retrieval of the referenced resources. 

This application profile was selected as an initial candidate for the collections 

discovery specification. 

o Security/Identity management: for the management of user identity, user 
profile, to have secure exchange of information between the EO DAIL and the 

GSs, the following protocols have been considered: 

o Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), developed by the Security 
Services Technical Committee of OASIS, is an XML-based framework for 

communicating user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. 

As its name suggests, SAML allows business entities to make assertions 

regarding the identity, attributes, and entitlements of a subject (an entity 

that is often a human user) to other entities, such as a partner company or 

another enterprise application. 

o Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a set of protocols for 
accessing information directories. LDAP is based on the standards 

contained within the X.500 standard, but is significantly simpler. And 

unlike X.500, LDAP supports TCP/IP, which is necessary for any type of 

Internet access. Because it's a simpler version of X.500, LDAP is 

sometimes called X.500-lite. It has been selected as the protocol for the 

management of user profiles. 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 39 
 

o WS-Security describes enhancements to SOAP messaging to provide 
quality of protection through message integrity, message confidentiality, 

and single message authentication. These mechanisms can be used to 

accommodate a wide variety of security models and encryption 

technologies. 

o WS-Security also provides a general-purpose mechanism for associating 
security tokens with messages. However, no specific type of security 

token is required by WS-Security. It is designed to be extensible (e.g. 

support multiple security token formats) to accommodate a variety of 

authentication and authorization mechanisms. For example, a requestor 

might provide proof of identity and a signed claim that they have a 

particular business certification. A Web service, receiving such a message 

could then determine what kind of trust they place in the claim. 

Additionally, WS-Security describes how to encode binary security tokens 

and attach them to SOAP messages. Specifically, the WS-Security profile 

specifications describes how to encode Username Tokens, X.509 Tokens, 

SAML Tokens , REL Tokens and Kerberos Tokens as well as how to 

include opaque encrypted keys as a sample of different binary token types. 

With WS-Security, the domain of these mechanisms can be extended by 

carrying authentication information in Web services requests. 

o WS-Policy provides a flexible and extensible grammar for expressing the 
capabilities, requirements, and general characteristics of entities in an 

XML Web services-based system. WS-Policy defines a framework and a 

model for the expression of these properties as policies. WS-Policy 

defines a policy to be a collection of policy alternatives, where each policy 

alternative is a collection of policy assertions. Some policy assertions 

specify traditional requirements and capabilities that will ultimately 

manifest on the wire (e.g., authentication scheme, transport protocol 

selection). Other policy assertions have no wire manifestation yet are 

critical to proper service selection and usage (e.g., privacy policy, QoS 

characteristics). WS-Policy provides a single policy grammar to allow 

both kinds of assertions to be reasoned about in a consistent manner. WS-

Policy does not specify how policies are discovered or attached to a Web 

service. 

11.2 Application of Protocols 

In the frame of FedEO Pilot activities the following new protocols have been proposed 

for standardization: 

o ―OGC Cataloguing of ISO Metadata (CIM) using the ebRIM profile of 
CS-W‖ (OGC 07-038 version 0.1.6), which is the ICD for the Collection & 

Service Discovery Services. 



OGC 07-152

The OGC 07-038 document complements the ebRIM application profile of CS-W for the 

cataloguing of ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 compliant metadata record. It defines for this 

purpose a Core ISO Metadata extension package of ebRIM. 

o ―OGC Catalogue Services Specification 2.0 - EO Products Extension 
Package for ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) Profile of CSW 2.0‖ (OGC 06-131 

version 0.1.6), which is the ICD for the Catalogue Service. 

The OGC 06-131 document describes the mapping of Earth Observation Products – 

defined in the OGC GML 3.1.1 Application schema for Earth Observation products 

[OGC 06-080r1] to an ebRIM structure within an OGC™ Catalogue 2.0.0 (with 

Corrigendum) [OGC 04-021r3] implementing the OGC™ ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) 

Profile [OGC 05-025r3]. 

o GML Application Schema for EO products (OGC 06-080 version 1.0.0), 
which is used for modelling the Earth Observation Product metadata. 

The OGC 06-080 defines an application schema of the Geography Markup Language 

(GML) version 3.1.1 for describing Earth Observation products (EO products) within the 

OGC 06-131. 

o Ordering Services for Earth Observation Products (OGC-06-141 version 
1.2.0), which is the ICD for Ordering service. 

o Sensor Planning Service Profile for Earth Observation Sensors (OGC-07-
018 version 0.9.4), which is the ICD for Programming ICD. 

o Earth Observation Application Profile for CSW 2.0 (OGC-06-079 version 
0.2.0) 

o Web Map Service – Application Profile for Earth Observation products 
(OGC-07-063 version 0.2.0) 

o User Management Interfaces for Earth Observation Services (OGC-07-118 
version0.0.1) 

11.3 Collection and Service Discovery Service 

For the discovery of collections and services, Open source tools as FAO‘s ―GeoNetwork 

Opensource‖ catalogue solution could be used for storing and discovering dataset 

collection metadata as well as the associated services.  The following dataset collections 

metadata were made accessible from the FedEO Clearinghouse via this protocol: 

o ESA‘s MUIS collection descriptions, 

o Eumetsat‘s UMARF collection descriptions, 

o GSE GMFS (Global Monitoring for Food Security), 



OGC 07-152

o An NGI Belgium catalogue (NSI project). 

 

 

Figure 15 : ESA collection discovery from GeoNetwork. 

The document-style SOAP bindings of the CSW to discover service and dataset 

collection metadata using the CSW ISO Profile was initially used. However, the 

Cataloguing of ISO Metadata(CIM) using the ebRIM profile of CSW was adopted to 

ensure coherence across the supported protocol stacks. A collection discovery service 

according to this specification was provided by both IONIC and EUMETSAT according 

to this specification.   

Also the integration of the three GEO Clearinghouse candidates was tested.  Three 

Clearinghouse Candidates are currently being considered which allow for allow for 

service and collection discovery: 

 Geonetwork Clearinghouse Candidate 1.   

 Compusult Clearinghouse Candidate 2.  

 ESRI Clearinghouse Candidate 3.  

For cross-platform testing GEO hopes to see that each of the GEO Web Portal candidates 

can demonstrate use of their integrated clients to query all three of the following 

instances of the GEOSS Clearinghouse:

 ESRI Clearinghouse Candidate: 
http://keel.esri.com/catalog/csw202?Service=CSW&Request=GetCapabilities 

 

The GEO Geonetwork Clearinghouse Candidate supports OGC CSW 2.0.2 (HTTP 

bindings) was successfully integrated as shown below.  The main problems experienced 

were problems with default namespaces, invalid character sets and the fact the 

clearinghouse was not deployed on port 80. 

 

Figure 16: Collection and service discovery via GEO Clearinghouse (GeoNetwork) 

The GEO Compusult Clearinghouse Candidate supports OGC CSW 2.0.2 (HTTP 

bindings) and CSW ebRIM Application Profile was partly integrated as shown below.  

The main remaining problem is the MIME type returned by the catalogue.   The official

OGC position in the CSW 2.0.2 specification (OGC 07-006) is that the catalogue should 

support "application/xml".  The Oracle BPEL Process manager 10.1.3 used as catalogue 

client currently does not support this MIME type. 

SPACEBEL has developed a workaround to cope with the MIME problem and the 

Compusult Clearinghouse Candidate has now successfully been integrated.

The third GEO Clearinghouse Candidate "ESRI" supports OGC CSW 2.0.2.  It could not 

be integrated as it does not return a MIME type in its GetRecords response but 

SPACEBEL managed to integrate it successfully. 

11.4 Service Discovery Services 

The FedEO Clearinghouse supports service discovery via Universal Description, 

Discovery and Integration – UDDI  from OASIS population of an instance of the UDDI 

is core of the registration of new services within the FedEO Clearinghouse built on SSE 

technilogy.

11.5 Catalogue Service 

The ebRIM Application Profile of CSW has been selected for the « dataset » (product) 

catalogue service.  It is an OGC CSW Application Profile that is also in use outside of the 

specific EO domain.  This strategy is in-line with the recent OGC decision to recommend 

the use of the ebRIM model as information model for future catalogue specifications.  

The ebRIM information model for EO data is defined in the EO extension package for 

ebRIM Profile of CSW2.0.  The following catalogues are currently accessible from the 

Clearinghouse via this protocol: 

o ESA MUIS, 

o Spot Image Dali, 

o Eumetsat UMARF, 

o NASA ECHO (as a prototype), 

o EC FP6 WIN catalogue (demonstrated in April 2007). 

The ebRIM information model for EO data is defined in the EO extension package for 

ebRIM Profile of CSW 2.0 has also been extended by CNES to support the International 

Charter ―Space and Major Disasters‖, and is currently being tested within the FedEO 

Clearinghouse. 

In CSW EO extension package for ebRIM (as well as in the CSW EO Application 

Profile) the metadata are specified as a GML application schema defined within OGC 06-

080. 

 

Figure 20 : Access to ESA MUIS catalogue. 



OGC 07-152

The above catalogues were combined using service orchestration to allow for distributed 

searches.  The resulting HM service called "FedEO clearinghouse for satellite based EO 

data" was made available on the FEDEO Clearinghouse Portal.  In addition, the same 

client and clearinghouse was integrated in the ESA-FAO GEO Portal candidate as 

depicted below.

Figure 23 : Expected relationship catalogue specifications. 

The first EO catalogue supporting the above specification stack for ebRIM required by 

OGC 06-131 issue 0.1.7 is the Spot Image DALI catalogue which was integrated in the 



OGC 07-152 

48 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

FedEO Clearinghouse in November 2007.  The main impact on the catalogue client was 

the different syntax inside the filter expressions 

In the course of the FedEO pilot activities, other ebRIM catalogue services have been 

integrated with ebRIM based profiles: 

 

Figure 24: Access to NASA ESG catalogue. 

In addition, access to JAXA catalogue using CSW 2.0.1 (HTTP bindings) has been 

successfully implemented despite a remaining problem related to the MIME type which 

is not supported by the Oracle orchestration engine: 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 49 
 

 

Figure 25: Access to JAXA catalogue. 

For completeness, we can also mention that other catalogues are accessible from the SSE 

Portal (FedEO Clearinghouse) which do not use the recommended FedEO protocols but 

are based on EOLI-XML (OGC 05-057), CSW Profile for EO (OGC 06-079) and the EC 

FP6 ORCHESTRA catalogue specification. 

The EO products catalogue services based on OGC 06-131 are combined as HM 

(heterogeneous mission) catalogues using BPEL service orchestration as explained in the 

next section. 

11.6 Programming service 

In the scope of FedEO, the programming service has been proposed by EADS Astrium 

based on the CoMu (Mission Planning for Constellations and Multi-Use) project 

prototype. This CoMu prototype is a system which helps a user to reach suitable mission 

GS in order to cover a product requirement. It transforms a requirement of imaging on an 

area of interest (multi mission programming request) into one or more request for 

programming (mission programming request) to affiliated missions GS. 

The Sensor Planning Service Profile for Earth Observation Sensors (OGC-07-018) is the 

ICD for the programming service. 

CoMu prototype is based on an imaging requirement on an area of interest, this one is 

taken in account in order to make a simulation on the capacity of the affiliated mission 

GS. This is a theoretical feasibility analysis. Then the missions GS are involved in order 

to perform a detailed feasibility analysis by taking into account the constraints of the 

mission planning of each mission GS. 



OGC 07-152 

50 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

On the basis of result of feasibility by the mission GS, CoMu is in charge to compute an 

optimal solution of acquisition on the area of interest by combining several missions in 

addition to the solutions of acquisition by single mission GS. 

The user then has the choice between the acquisition by a single mission and the 

acquisition achieved by several mission. 

In parallel of the submission of an imaging requirement, CoMu must also take into 

account the requests for programming cancellation and the request for programming 

status. 

CoMu is thus interfaced toward the final user for the requirement specification and the 

choice of the programming and is also directly interfaced with the mission GS which 

achieve the mission plan of each satellite by taking into account in particular the mission 

programming requests emitted within the framework of CoMu.

11.7 Order service 

11.8 Online Data Access service 

The EADS Astrium‘s MeTiS product has been used in the scope of FedEO for accessing 

WMS through web2.0 technologies. 

MeTiS is a virtual earth information environment integrating both benefits of Web 2.0 

wave technologies together with OGC interoperability standards (WMS). MeTiS offers to 

end user an ergonomic and user friendly interface for geospatial data discovery and 

aggregation. Dedicated to users‘ needs for environmental monitoring purpose, MeTiS 

manages and records user-context allowing persistent remote access to various distributed 

data sources. It provides access to remote interoperable servers such as background 

―streaming‖ web map APIs like Googlemap, YahooMap, Windows Live Local, etc… and 

environmental WMS offering access to data and value added products at different scales 

relevant to different user communities. 

MeTiS offers many functional and operational capabilities such as navigation into a web 

on-line ―Google Map Like‖ application, subscription to a certain number of WMS and 

dynamically aggregates the related layers, definition and management of different 

thematic working environments and saving/restoring users‘ context for further 

connections.

12 Operational issues 

12.1 Collection Discovery Service 

As for the discovery of services, the OGC CS-W 2.0.1 ISO Metadata Application Profile 

was used for the discovery of EO product collections of which the metadata is encoded 

within an ISO 19115 and ISO 19139 based model and encoding. As a consequence 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 53 
 

existing COTS and Open Source tools as FAO‘s ―GeoNetwork Opensource‖ catalogue 

solution can for instance be used for storing and discovering dataset collection metadata 

as well as the associated services. 

In the meanwhile, we are migrating to the OGC CS-W 2.0 ebRIM Application profile and 

more in particular the ISO 19115/19119 extension package for ebRIM (OGC 07-038).  In 

the framework of FEDEO, a first such catalogue was published by Ionic Software. 

 

12.2 Service Discovery Service 

The OGC CS-W 2.0.1 ISO Metadata Application Profile (OGC 04-038) was used for 

service discovery. This application profile of the Catalog Services for the Web - CS-W 

specification provides ISO 19139 compatible XML Schema for Catalog Search Result 

sets for ISO 19115 (data) and ISO 19119 (service) metadata. In addition, it defines the 

available operations and the supported query criteria (queryables) that catalog clients can 

use for interacting with the catalog service.  It enables users to discover and retrieve 

metadata about available Earth Observation related services hereby providing sufficient 

information to assess the usefulness of a service for the task at hand. Furthermore, it 

offers the binding information for accessing this service (e.g. HTTP binding together with 

a hyperlink composed of a GetCapabilities request of an OGC Web Service - OWS 

(WMS, WCS, WFS). In addition, FedEO can support service discovery via Universal 

Description, Discovery and Integration – UDDI
 
from OASIS with the advantage of 

allowing mainstream IT tools from large vendors (Oracle, IBM, Microsoft) to discover 

the exposed services. 

We are currently migrating from the ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile to the OGC 

CS-W 2.0 ebRIM Application profile and more in particular the ISO 19115/19119 

extension package for ebRIM (OGC 07-038).  In the framework of FedEO, a first such 

catalogue was published by IONIC-LEICA. 

12.3 Catalogue Service 

For the « dataset » (product) catalogue service the CS-W Application Profile for Earth 

Observation (OGC 06-079) was initially proposed to take into account the EO specific 

product metadata.  

Since then, we have migrated to the ebRIM Application Profile of CS-W as this allows 

using an application profile that is also in use outside the EO domain.  This is in-line with 

the recent OGC decision to recommend the use of the ebRIM model as information 

model for future catalogue specifications.  The ebRIM information model for EO data is 

defined in the EO extension package for ebRIM Profile of CSW2.0 (OGC 06-131). In 

both cases, the metadata are specified as a GML application schema defined within OGC 

06-080. 

A first version of CITE TEAM tests for the specification OGC 06-131 is being finalised 

for the moment under ESA contract.  It is expected that these conformance tests which 

are based on the same engine used by the OGC will be on-line early 2008.

12.4 Programming Services 

12.4.1 Comments on Programming ICD 

Hereafter the list issues related to the Programming ICD: 

 Confusion on document and schema versions 

Schemas refer to 0.9.4, while the document does not provide its version number. 

 Error handling 

The reference to the exception specification of OGC Web Service Specification is 

wrong: the correct section is §8 and not §7.4 (e.g. see §13.6, §14.6, 15.3.1, etc.) 

 GetCapabilities response 

Not clear the meaning of the following fields: 

 sps:RequiresNotificationTarget 

 sps:SubsequentGetFeasibilitySupported 

 wns:SupportedCommunicationProtocols 

 wns:SupportedCommunicationFormats 
Additionally seems missing a parameter specifying the support of WS-Addressing 

for asynchronous requests. 

 Tasking Parameters 

The section §8.2 describes the preliminary list of tasking parameters providing a 

short description and type for each of them. It is missing the specification of 

which sps:definition to use i.e. what element of the following ones has to be used 

for each the parameters: 

o sps:commonData element, which implies SWECommon; 

o sps:TaskMessageDefinition, which is not clear how does it work; 

o sps:GeometryDefinition 

o sps:ParameterDescriptor for nested parameters 

 

Additionally for each of above elements further information is needed: 

o in case of sps:commonData element, it is necessary to specify which 
SWECommon type has to be used e.g.: Count, Quantity, Text, Category, 

TimeRange, DataRecord, etc. 

o in case of sps:GeometryDefinition, it is necessary to specify whether it is a 
gml:Polygon or gml:Point etc..  

o in case of nested parameters it is necessary to specify whether 
swe:DataRecord or nested sps:ParameterDescriptor have to be used.  



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 55 
 

To be noted that SWECommon types allow defining complex and nested 

structures without the need of using nested sps:ParameterDescriptor. In 

fact for example, the swe:DataRecord allows specifying elements that can 

be simple or complex type as well; array are also supported. 

Then it is suggested: 

o either to complement that paragraph with a table specifying all above 
information for each identified parameter  

o or provide a rule and a template XML file showing how the different 
parameters have to be declared and set. 

 Detailed comments on sps:ParameterDescriptor: 

o sps:restriction can be removed because constraints can be defined directly 
within SWE Common types. 

o sps:cardinality is not described in the document. 
o Parameter names are case sensitive? 

 Detailed comments on preliminary identified tasking parameters: 
o ―Urgence‖ to be corrected to ―Urgency‖. It is defined as Quality of service 

but the values are not aligned with the OS EO [AD-02]. 

o Polarization Mode to be clarified: what‘s the meaning of these values? D, 
Q, S, T, UNDEFINED.  

This is a comment for GML Application schema rather than SPS EO. 

o Clarification on SurveyPeriods: 

 If a sensor can be tasked by scenes and by coverage, how it can be 
encoded?  

How the choice specified in §8.2.6 can be encoded when declaring 

the parameter? 

o TemporalSeries: there is only the periodicity and not also the repetition 
(then the standing order will never finish). 

o The tasking parameters for coverage orders are too few: in fact it is not 
possible to filter also by orbit, pass, track, frame (which are currently 

supported by the ESA Catalogue when computing future potential 

products). 

 ―Estimate‖ Feasibility Level 
This level of feasibility analysis takes into account also meteorological data. It 

looks not necessary because it is implicit when specifying the ―Validation 

Parameters‖. In fact when the tasking parameters include the accepted level of 

snow or cloud coverage it implies automatically to use meteorological data. Then 

it is suggested to use only 2 levels e.g. ―Standard‖ and ―Full‖ (when the mission 

planning is also considered). 

 GetFeasibility input parameters 
It is not clear the purpose of ID element in the get feasibility request. 

 Get Feasibility Output Parameters 
In the current release of the Programming ICD it is not yet defined how scenes / 

strips calculated by the feasibility analysis are represented i.e. which parameters 

(EO Product Metadata attributes) have to be returned.  



OGC 07-152 

56 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

 Quotation 

In case of stand alone usage of Programming ICD it is suggested to add 

GetQuotation operation, similar to that of Ordering ICD, for getting a cost 

estimation of the tasking request going to be submitted. 

12.4.2 Further details on encoding of Tasking Parameters / ordering options 

The choice of using dynamic extensible lists for modelling tasking parameters and 

ordering options has the advantage of allowing each SPS / OS server to specify all the 

parameters that are deemed necessary (as already said, sps:ParameterDescriptor allows 

modelling every data type), but it has the following drawbacks: 

 This flexibility is achieved practically leaving part of the messages without a 
schema type, which implies: 

o The correctness of messages cannot be easily verified. 

o Misunderstandings on message format are very probable because there is 
not a formalized definition. 

o Tools generating automatically XML readers / writers according an XML 
schema cannot manage the unspecified section; 

 Because there is not a schema, then another XML file describing in some way the 
expected content of the tasking parameters / order options is needed 

(GetOptionsResponse, DescribeGetFeasibilityResponse, 

DescribeSubmitResponse). 

12.5 Ordering Services 

The FedEO Clearinghouse built on SSE technology, provides interfaces to access 

programming and ordering services for EO products.  The programming interface 

constitutes an EO profile of the OGC Sensor Planning Service - SPS.  The ordering 

service interfaces are defined in the Ordering Services for Earth Observation Products 

specification. 

12.6 Online Data Access 

The following set of geospatial services defined by the OGC will be used for user 

interaction and/or data access and information visualization: 

Web Map Service – WMS : This OGC implementation specification (and ISO standard) 

defines the interactions between client and server applications for the delivery of maps, 

rendered geographic information, over HTTP. Within the proposed architecture, this 

standard is employed for both supplying background maps and for visualizing outputs of 

services.  For example, browse images of EO products can be visualised during catalog 

searches by employing this protocol. 

The handling of EO data within WMS is, however, problematic as: 



OGC 07-152 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 57 
 

1. the flexibility of the WMS specification leads to non-interoperable 
implementations; 

2. EO data is often reacquired repeatedly, necessitating the handling of hundreds to 
tens of thousands of unique maps. 

An EO specific application profile of the WMS specification was defined as an OGC 

Discussion Paper in 2006.  As part of the FedEO Pilot Project, this draft specification was 

updated and a reference implementation created.  As well a providing a well-constrained, 

consistent handling for the visualisation of EO products, this specification and 

implementation also enables the interactive browse of spatial quality metadata.  In other 

words, the EO products discovered by a catalogue search can be evaluated to see if they 

are fit for purpose before the full data product is ordered or downloaded. 

Web Coverage Service – WCS: The OGC implementation specification related to the 

delivery of coverage, in casu raster data files, across the Internet.  It is used as the 

interface by which clients can download and visualize EO products. 

12.7 Processing Service 

The FedEO Clearinghouse provides already access to a number of processing services.  

The IMERIS processor running on the ESA G-POD infrastructure was made accessible 

via SSE in 2006.  Recently a number of "fusion" services developed under the EC FP6 

project SANY were integrated with an OGC WPS (Web Processing Service) interface. 

In past OGC testbeds OWS-3 and OWS-4, also coordinate conversion services were 

made available through the SSE by Spot Image and other organisations as OGC WCTS 

(Web Coordinate Transformation) services.  This was documented in the IPR documents 

OGC 05-140 and OGC 07-008.  These services are still accessible via the FedEO 

Clearinghouse Portal.

13.3 Scenario Script: 

As this scenario differs in several ways from the standard operational concept of the 

Disaster Charter, it is preferable not to refer to Charter specific vocabulary such as ECO 

(Emergency on Call Officer). 

It is planned to combine filming and screen captures. 

VISION  ACTIONS/AUDIO (to be expanded) Comments 

Film sequence of an 

operator is facing 2 

screens 

Zoom on the 1st screen 

showing the GEO Portal 

with the maps of Alert 

services 

Screen capture of GEO 

Portal 

Zoom on the 2nd screen 

where the details of the 

USGS alert (through RSS 

feed) are shown in (e.g.) 

the google interface 

Screen capture of the 

USGS alert 

Introduction on the disaster (scene, date, etc) 

An operator has 2 screens in front of him. On the 

opening shot, he is looking at the GEO Portal on 

screen 1 

His attention is drawn to screen 2 where the USGS 

RSS Feed generates an alert corresponding to the oil 

spill in the Philippines region 

Ideally the GEO portal 

would integrate the 

USGS RSS feed but it 

seems that the CAP 

format used by USGS is 

not read by the GEO 

Portal 

As a 2nd choice, a GEO 

Portal compatible RSS 

feed should be created 

to show the alert sign 

on the GEO Portal map 

before moving to the 

2nd screen to see the 

details of the alert from 

the USGS feed 

Film sequence of the 

operator accessing the 

SSE portal on screen 1 

Screen captures from the 

manipulation of the SSE 

portal 

The operator logs onto the SSE portal 

He performs a multi-catalogue search selecting 

collections from ESA, SPOT Image, EUMETSAT 

and JAXA (TBD) catalogues 

He analyses the results, which includes an ASAR data 

Should we rename the 

SSE portal (e.g. FedEO 

portal) for the film? 

Meteosat collections 

will obviously not 

return any products on 

the ROI  

 Capture of the SSE 

operations 

The operator clicks on the thumbnail of the ASAR 

data  

The GIM WMS viewer displays the ASAR image 

The operator selects the order option for the ASAR 

data and proceed to the Ordering page 

ASAR only as we want 

to then show him 

looking at SPOT and 

MERIS future 

acquisitions (next step)

VISION  ACTIONS/AUDIO (to be expanded) Comments 

Captures of the KSAT 

processing s/w 

The ASAR data is processed by KSAT to extract oil 

slick characteristics 

The results are shown on the KSAT viewer 

The report is briefly shown on the screen 

This is a slight 

adaptation of the KSAT 

oil spill service as 

KSAT service tends to 

be used for monitoring 

and detection rather 

than post event analysis 

Capture of the SSE 

operations 

The operator selects the multi-mission programming 

service  

He performs an SPS EO Profile compatible 

GetFeasibility requests for SPOT and MERIS 

instruments  

The result of the search is shown on the SSE GUI 

The operator selects one or more of the SPOT scenes 

and submit the programming request (TBD if the GUI 

will allow) 

Availability of the 

MERIS interface is 

TBD 

Can we obtain MERIS 

data? 

Capture of the SSE 

operations (possibly fast 

forward for the catalogue 

operations) 

Narration to explain the acquisition process 

The operator access the acquired data through the 

catalogue (quick execution) 

The operator visualize the SPOT data on the SSE 

WMS 

The SPOT data viewed 

may not be the one 

selected in the 

programming step, 

however it should not 

be noticeable   

Film sequence of the 

operator turning to screen 

2 

Screen capture of 

RedSpider catalogue 

actions 

On screen 2, the operator makes a search for available 

services in the areas on the RedSpider service 

catalogue 

Analyses the results 

Select services 

View those services on the Metis viewer over the 

Google Earth map 

For the moment, we 

only have one WMS 

service 

The results include the 

KSAT WMS server 

containing the data  

Ideally the Metis 

viewer would allow 

viewing the ASAR and 

SPOT data as 

background

VISION  ACTIONS/AUDIO (to be expanded) Comments 

Film sequence of the 

operator turns towards 

screen 1 

Capture of SSE operations 

Film sequence of the 

operator preparing an 

action plan on the basis of 

the image on the screen 

The operator is now looking the GIM viewer of the 

SSE which displays both the EO images and the 

layers from the services discovered in the RedSpider 

catalogue 

The operator makes several manipulations with layers 

The operator draws an action plan  

 

Screen capture of the 

ESONET interface 

The operator uses the interface to the ESONET to 

convey his action plan 

To be continued…. 

Need more details 

about the ESONET 

interface
