i. Preface 

This document was developed as part of the Image Handling Thread of the OGC Web 
Services Initiative Phase 1 Thread Set 2 (OWS 1.2). This document specified the 
requirements for the image handling functions to be supported by draft specifications 
prepared under that thread. Not all of the requirements stated herein were supported by 
the draft specifications prepared. These draft specifications were largely, but not 
completely, implemented and tested in that testbed. 

This is now an OGC Discussion Paper made publicly available for review by OGC 
members and other interested parties. Comments and suggestions on this Discussion 
Paper are welcome and encouraged. Such comments and suggestions may be submitted 
by email message. 

This document specifies the requirements for both the image archive and catalog 
services, although those services will be specified largely separately, because the 
requirements have many overlaps. This document also specifies the requirements for the 
image metadata to be used in the OWS 1.2 testbed. Finally, Annex C (informative) 
specifies tentative requirements for an expected future image distribution service. 

NOTE  This document currently uses the terms "archive" and "archiving" service; one alternative 
synonymous term is "repository" service. This document also uses the terms "catalog" and "cataloging" 
service; one alternative synonymous term is "registry" service.

Introduction 

This report specifies the image handling functionality required to be provided by the 
relevant set of OGC Web Services Initiative Phase 1 Thread Set 2 (OWS 1.2) draft 
engineering specifications. This report also specifies the image metadata requirements for 
the OWS 1.2 testbed, to support demonstration of this image handling functionality. 

An image is defined as a special type of gridded coverage, with the coverage function 
relating locations on the ground to their representation in an image. The images discussed 
in this document could be collected by video, radar, or some other type of a sensor. These 
images could be processed and analyzed by photogrammetric software. 

The required image handling functionality supports both discovery and evaluation of 
images for possible exploitation, and retrieving discovered images for exploitation (or 
use). In an implementation of the OWS architecture, a set of archives stores the set of 
images currently accessible for exploitation, and allows a set of clients to retrieve 
selected images and subsets of images for exploitation. A set of catalogs store metadata 
for the set of images currently archived, and allows a set of clients to query this metadata 
to discover and evaluate images that might be exploited. 

This report specifies abilities for handling a wide variety of images, including original, 
derived, orthorectified, and mosaicked images. In an original or derived image, the pixels 
are evenly spaced in an image coordinate reference system. This image coordinate 
reference system is usually considered to be Cartesian, with a rectangular extent and the 
origin in the center or corner of the image. Orthorectified and mosaicked images have 
image pixels resampled into a grid coordinate reference system (usually not into a ground 
coordinate reference system). This grid coordinate reference system is usually Cartesian 
with a rectangular extent. 

This report specifies abilities for handling a very large set of images currently accessible 
for exploitation within a large enterprise, with heavy usage and frequent additions to this 
set of images. For example, ~107 images might be archived, with ~104 additional images 
per day, ~106 image retrievals per day, and ~106 image queries per day.

OWS 1.2 image handling requirements 

1 Scope 

This report specifies the image handling functionality required for the OGC Web 
Services Initiative Phase 1 Thread Set 2 (OWS 1.2). The ability to support these functions 
is required in the relevant set of draft engineering specifications produced in OWS 1.2. 
The scope of this report includes summarizing the image: 

a) Archive service interface requirements 

b) Catalog service interface requirements 

c) Metadata to be used in the OWS 1.2 testbed requirements 

d) Distribution service interface tentative requirements 

NOTE  An image distribution service is expected to be required in the future, to reduce client 
requirements for inputting images and metadata into archives and catalogs. Since this future service 
impacts some of the thinking for the image archive and catalog services, the image distribution service 
tentative requirements are discussed in Annex C (informative). 

The scope of the required image handling functionality can be summarized: 

a) Support both query to discover images (for exploitation) and exploitation (or use) of 
(discovered) images. In an implementation of the OWS architecture, a set of archives 
(or repositories) stores the set of images currently accessible for exploitation, and 
allows a set of clients to access selected images or subsets of images for exploitation. 
A set of catalogs (or registries) store metadata for the set of images currently 
archived, and allows a set of clients to query this metadata to discover and evaluate 
images that might be exploited. 

b) Handle original, derived, orthorectified, and mosaicked images. In an original or 
derived image, the pixels are evenly spaced in an image coordinate reference system. 
This image coordinate reference system is usually considered to be Cartesian with a 
rectangular extent and the origin in the center or corner of the image. Orthorectified 
or mosaicked images have image pixels resampled into a grid coordinate reference 
system (usually not into a ground coordinate reference system). This grid coordinate 
reference system is usually Cartesian with a rectangular extent. 

c) Handle both georeferenced and ungeoreferenced images. A georeferenced image has 
at least one known coordinate transformation between the image coordinate reference 
system and a ground coordinate reference system. An ungeoreferenced image has no 
known coordinate transformation between the image coordinate reference system and 
any ground coordinate reference system.

OGC 04-052 

d) Handle a wide variety of digital image types, sizes, and formats, including 
compressed and tiled image data. An image can be collected instantaneously (e.g., by 
a frame camera) or by a camera that moves during image exposure (e.g., pushbroom, 
panoramic, and whiskbroom cameras). Images collected by both optical and radar 
image sensors should be handled. Images can be single-band (greyscale) and multi-
band (color, multispectral, or hyperspectral). Both single (still) images and video 
(time sequence of) images should be handled. 

e) Handle a very large set of images currently accessible for exploitation within a large 
enterprise, with heavy usage and frequent additions to this set of images. For 
example, ~107 images might be archived, with ~104 additional images per day, ~106 
image retrievals per day, and ~106 image queries per day. 

This report summarizes the OWS 1.2 requirements for handling images, sometimes 
ignoring the requirements and abilities for handling other forms of geospatial data, 
including digital feature data and more general coverages.

4 Usage scenarios 

Images are a common source of geospatial information, and image exploitation is used 
both to make decisions and to produce other geospatial information. The images used by 
an enterprise are often numerous, making highly desirable the use of image cataloging 
and archiving services. A catalog service will store metadata about a set of images, and 
support query to discover images suitable for exploitation. An archive service will store 
and manage a set of images, and support retrieval of discovered images for exploitation.

OGC 04-052 

An archive service may also store image metadata, especially metadata needed for image 
exploitation but not for discovery. 

A large enterprise will often require the use of multiple image catalog and archive 
services. That is, a set of archives stores the set of images currently accessible for 
exploitation, and allows a set of clients to retrieve selected images and subsets of images 
for exploitation. A set of catalogs store metadata for the set of images currently archived, 
and allows a set of clients to query this metadata to discover and evaluate images that 
might be exploited. 

More detailed image handling use cases are summarized and referenced in Annex A 
(informative). Also, more usage scenario information is included in Clause 3 of the OWS 
Image handling architecture DIPR. 

5 Requirements 

5.1 Introduction 

This clause specifies the requirements for the image archive service interface(s), image 
catalog service interface(s), and image metadata for OWS 1.2. The requirements common 
to the archive function, catalog function, and metadata are specified first, followed by the 
specific requirements for each. 

5.2 Common requirements 

5.2.1 Introduction 

This subclause specifies the OWS 1.2 requirements that are common to all image 
handling, including the image archive service interface(s), image catalog service 
interface(s), and image metadata. These common requirements are specified in the 
groups: 

a) Image categories 

b) Image types 

c) Image sizes and formats 

d) Image metadata structure 

e) Multiple servers 

f) Enterprise scalability 

g) Web service interfaces

OGC 04-052 

5.2.2 Image categories 

The image metadata, image archive interface(s), and image catalog interface(s) shall all 
meet the following image category requirements: 

a) Original, derived, orthorectified, and mosaicked images shall all be able to be 
handled, by the same server instances. 

NOTE  This ability shall be specified in the image archiving and cataloging interface specification(s) 
prepared under OWS 1.2. The image archive and catalog server components implemented in the OWS 1.2 
testbed may not fully implement this ability. However, the image archive and catalog server components 
implemented in the OWS 1.2 testbed shall at least handle original and orthorectified images. 

b) Georeferenced and non-georeferenced images shall both be able to be handled, by the 
same server instances. 

c) Image geometry model coordinate transformations shall be used for georeferenced 
original images, to relate any position in the image coordinate reference system with 
the corresponding position in a ground coordinate reference system. 

d) Coordinate transformations shall be able to be used for georeferenced derived images, 
to relate any position in the image coordinate reference system with the 
corresponding position in the original image coordinate reference system. Also, an 
image geometry model shall be able to be used for georeferenced derived images, to 
relate any position in the image coordinate reference system with the corresponding 
position in a ground coordinate reference system. 

e) Coordinate transformations shall be used for georeferenced orthorectified and 
mosaicked images, to relate any position in the grid coordinate reference system with 
the corresponding position in a ground coordinate reference system. 

f) All the coordinate transformations used to meet requirements c), d), and e) shall be 
specified by image metadata that is input into and stored by archive and/or catalog 
services. 

g) All the coordinate transformations used to meet requirements c), d), and e) shall be 
XML encoded based on the Coordinate Operation package of the UML model in 
OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. More specifically, this XML encoding shall be 
based on the modified and expanded UML model for Topic 2 that is contained in the 
attachments to OGC Document 02-036r2, and the XML Schemas encoding that UML 
model also contained in those attachments. 

Some of the terms used in the above requirements statements are discussed in Annex B 
(informative). For example, a "coordinate transformation" need not be in analytic form; it 
may be a table.

OGC 04-052 

5.2.3 Image types 

The image metadata, image archive interface(s), and image catalog interface(s) shall all 
be able to handle a wide variety of image types, including: 

a) Images collected by optical, radar, lidar, sonar, and other image sensors. 

b) Both single-band (grey scale) and multi-band (color, multispectral, or hyperspectral) 
images. The metadata and interfaces should not limit the maximum number of image 
bands (although implementations can limit the number of bands). 

c) Images both collected instantaneously (e.g., by a frame camera) and by a camera that 
moves during image exposure (e.g., pushbroom, panoramic, and whiskbroom 
cameras). 

d) Both single (still) images and video (time sequence of) images. 

5.2.4 Image sizes and formats 

The image metadata, image archive interface(s), and image catalog interface(s) shall all 
be able to handle a wide variety of image sizes and formats, including: 

a) Image sizes from less than 1,000,000 pixels (1 Megapixel) to at least 10,000,000,000 
pixels (10 Terapixels) in one image. 

b) Pixel bits per band from one bit to 16 bits (uncompressed). 

c) Both uncompressed and compressed image data, where data compression reduces the 
average number of bits per pixel or band to a few bits or a fraction of one bit, 
including non-integer average numbers of bits. 

d) Both pixels sequenced by row and column within the entire image and within each 
rectangular tile of a tiled large image, where the tiles are then sequenced by tile row 
and column. Tile sizes may or may not be powers of two pixels in each image 
direction. 

5.2.5 Image metadata structure 

The image metadata, image archive interface(s), and image catalog interface(s) shall 
together meet the following metadata structure requirements: 

a) Image metadata shall be divided into multiple groups that are “logically” separated 
for retrieval and input. 

NOTE 1 The primary reason for multiple groups is metadata reuse. Some metadata groups will be 
common for many different images. One example of such metadata is basic sensor data, including the 
camera interior orientation. Other metadata groups will have multiple contents for one image. An example 
is the estimated transformation from ground to image coordinates (exterior orientation). In most uses, 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 7
 



OGC 04-052 

metadata values are not updated and the old values lost; instead, new metadata values are added while the 
previous values are retained. 

NOTE 2 Another reason for implementing multiple metadata groups is that the contents of different 
groups become available at significantly different times. It is important to be able to input each group into 
the catalog and/or archive when the data becomes available, thus avoiding update of the larger set of 
metadata and data. For example, the data that is common to many images is often available months before 
most of the corresponding images are collected. Moreover, multiple versions of the same metadata are 
recorded for a single image largely because it becomes available at significantly different times (e.g., 
separated by days). 

b) These multiple metadata groups shall be linked, and the links shall be automatically 
traversed, to provide the “virtual” appearance of a complete structure that is queried 
and retrieved as if they were one structure. 

c) The metadata for multiple images shall be able to be aggregated into image 
collections. 

NOTE 3 Such image collections can be used to aid user comprehension and data management. For 
example, all the images collected over a single "target" for the purposes of some analysis could be 
referenced as one logical "collection" of images. Such an image collection may be formed based on the 
location of the target, date range of collection, and analysis theme, etc. Such a collection may be formed 
"manually" and maintained by a particular user. Indeed, a hierarchy or net of collections could be formed, 
with some images included in multiple collections. 

d) The metadata for multiple images shall not be required to be aggregated into image 
collections, for any purpose. 

NOTE 4 Useful and defined image collections do not exist for many images. 

5.2.6 Multiple servers 

The image archive interface(s), image catalog interface(s), and image metadata shall 
together meet the following multiple server instance requirements: 

a) The archiving and cataloging functions shall use interfaces and metadata that, when 
implemented by different web server instances, shall allow multiple catalog services 
to easily work with multiple archive services. 

b) One catalog server instance shall be able to handle metadata for data handled by 
multiple archive server instances. 

c) Multiple catalog server instances shall be able to handle metadata for different data 
handled by one archive server instance. In addition, multiple catalog server instances 
shall be able to handle metadata for the same data handled by one archive server 
instance. 

d) The transition from image discovery, using an image catalog service, to image 
exploitation, using an image archive service, should be as smooth and easy as 
practical.

OGC 04-052 

EXAMPLE  A catalog server shall store metadata that includes the data identifier by which that complete data 
item can be easily retrieved from an archive server which stores that data item. 

5.2.7 Enterprise scalability 

The components implemented in OWS 1.2 will be exercised with only limited quantities 
of data during this initiative. However, the service interfaces and metadata specified shall 
be scalable for use in a large enterprise, which archives, queries, and retrieves large 
quantities of data that change rapidly. Specifically, such a large enterprise may need to 
handle the magnitudes specified in Table 1. This table shows order-of-magnitude 
numbers; these numbers are probably within a factor of ten larger or smaller than the 
actual numbers for some large enterprises. 

Table 1 — Large enterprise order-of-magnitudes 

Quantity Order-of-magnitude 

Number of datasets archived 10,000,000 

Number of new datasets per day 10,000 

Number of queries per day from clients 1,000,000 

Number of entire datasets retrieved per day 100,000 

Number of dataset sections retrieved per day 1,000,000 

Average number of pixels in one image 1,000,000,000 

Average number of pixels in one image section 10,000,000 

Number of archive servers 1,000 

Number of catalog servers 100 
 
NOTE 1 Each archive server instance will normally have a required maximum time from when an 
archive receives an image until that image is fully available to clients. That maximum time requirement is 
typically several minutes, and is considered very important. However, the ability to meet such a time 
requirement heavily depends on the speed of the computer system used to implement the archive. 
Therefore, this maximum time is not listed in the table above. 

Digital images can be the vast majority of the listed order-of-magnitude numbers in some 
enterprises, although these magnitude numbers include all types of geospatial data. The 
images to be exploited, or currently being exploited, by a large organization or geospatial 
community are often numerous, with many new images being received each day. 

NOTE 2 These enterprise scalability requirements are explicitly stated because some existing OWS 
interfaces do not appear to support such large numbers. For example, the Web Map Service (WMS) version 
1.1.1 interface specifies a GetCapabilities operation that returns a list of all the data layers available from a 
server implementation. No other direct means is specified for a client to find out what layers are available 
from a WMS server instance. That interface version does not appear suitable for serving perhaps 10,000 
data layers with perhaps 100 new layers per day.

OGC 04-052 

5.2.8 Web service interfaces 

The service interfaces specified to support the image archive and image catalog functions 
shall meet the following web service interface requirements: 

a) The image archiving and cataloging functions shall each use specified interfaces that 
can also handle many types of non-image geospatial data and metadata, including 
features and other coverage data, which can be stored in the same web server 
instances. (Of course, different types of data and metadata will require use of 
different data schemas, but the interface differences should be limited to different 
data schemas. Also, some interface abilities may be limited to certain types of data.) 
All the following requirements shall apply to archiving and cataloging service 
interfaces that can handle multiple types of geospatial data. 

NOTE 1 This ability shall be specified in the image archiving and cataloging interface specification(s) 
prepared under OWS 1.2 . However, the image archive and catalog server components implemented in the 
OWS 1.2 testbed are not expected to fully implement this ability. 

b) The archiving and cataloging functions shall each use OGC Web Service (OWS) 
styled interfaces and operations, and shall each adapt existing OWS interfaces (such 
as WFS, WCS, WMS, and WRS). 

c) The archiving and cataloging functions shall use interfaces that are as nearly identical 
as is deemed practical. 

d) The archiving and cataloging functions shall use interfaces that are separately 
specified so they can be separately implemented. 

e) The archiving and cataloging functions shall use interfaces that can be implemented 
by the same web server instance, when desired. 

NOTE 2 The more-specific requirements stated in Subclauses 5.3 and 5.4 are partially based on 
requirements a) through e) listed above, and provide more specifics. 

f) The image archiving and cataloging functions shall each use service interfaces that 
are specified and implemented to allow more than one client to simultaneously 
request the same and different operations from one image archive or catalog server 
instance. 

5.3 Image archive requirements 

5.3.1 Introduction 

This subclause specifies the more-specific requirements for the image archive function 
interface(s) that are specified in OWS 1.2, in addition to the common requirements 
specified in Subclause 5.2. This subclause specifies that a set of web services operations 
be provided by one or more interfaces which can be implemented by one server providing 
the required image archive functionality. However, this subclause does not specify the: 

10 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 



OGC 04-052 

a) Number of those operations, or their names 

b) Number of those interfaces, or their names 

One or more interfaces shall be specified that, when all are implemented by one archive 
server instance, provide operations that support the functionality specified in the 
following subclauses, namely providing operations allowing: 

a) Get service metadata 

b) Get schema 

c) Input and delete object 

d) Get object 

e) Get coverage (optional) 

f) Get map (optional) 

5.3.2 Get service metadata 

The archive function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following service metadata retrieval requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve service metadata for the archive server 
instance. 

b) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving service metadata that describes all the 
operations implemented by the archive server instance, providing information needed 
for a client to request those operations and use the operation responses. 

c) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving a list of all the data and metadata types that 
can (currently) be retrieved from or input into the archive server instance. This 
operation(s) shall not require retrieving some metadata from all of the data and/or 
metadata groups currently stored by the archive server instance. Also, this 
operation(s) should not require retrieving the complete data schema for all of the data 
and metadata types that can be stored. 

d) The service metadata output(s) shall be encoded in XML. 

e) The output contents and format(s) shall be specified using XML Schema, and those 
schema(s) should be based on GML wherever applicable. 

f) This operation(s) shall be required implementation by all compliant archive server 
instances. 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 11
 



OGC 04-052 

NOTE  That is, an archive server instance which does not (fully) implement this operation(s) shall not 
be considered compliant with the specification. All the image archiving server components implemented in 
the OWS 1.2 testbed shall implement this operation(s). 

This get service metadata operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) GetCapabilities operation of the WFS, WRS, or WOS. 

b) Get service metadata operation(s) of the catalog services described in Subclause 
5.4.2. 

5.3.3 Get schema 

The archive function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following data schemas retrieval requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve the data schema(s) (or data schemas) 
used for selected types of data and/or metadata that can (currently) be stored by the 
archive server instance. This operation(s) should not always retrieve the data 
schema(s) for all types of data and/or metadata that can (currently) be stored by the 
archive server instance. Also, this operation(s) shall not always retrieve some data or 
metadata for all instances of the type(s). 

b) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving data schemas for image metadata and also for 
other types of geospatial data and metadata that are stored in the same archive server 
instance. 

c) The type(s) of data or metadata for which schema(s) are retrieved shall be able to be 
selected by specifying the data type identifier(s) which can be retrieved from the 
same archive service using the get service metadata operation(s) discussed in 
Subclause 5.3.2. 

d) The output format shall be XML Schema for all XML encoded data and metadata, 
and those schema(s) shall be GML application schemas wherever applicable. 

e) This operation(s) shall be required implementation by all compliant archive server 
instances. 

This get schema operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) DescribeFeatureType operation of the WFS or DescribeRecord operation of the 
WRS. 

b) Get schema operation(s) of the catalog services described in Subclause 5.4.3.

OGC 04-052 

5.3.4 Input and delete object 

The archive function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following data input and management requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to input new data and metadata groups that will 
be stored by the archive server instance. 

b) This operation(s) shall allow input of entire new data and/or metadata groups that are 
provided as operation input parameters. 

c) This operation(s) shall allow input of modified versions of previously input data 
and/or metadata groups, where entire groups are provided as operation input 
parameters. When a modified version is input, both the new modified version and the 
previously input version(s) shall be stored and shall be retrievable. If two or more 
modified versions are input "simultaneously", all these modified versions shall be 
stored and shall be retrievable. 

NOTE 1 Both the modified version and the previously input version(s) are expected to be required to be 
stored indefinitely by most archive applications. However, indefinitely storing previous version(s) will not 
always be required by an application. There is no requirement to allow input of a modified version of a data 
and/or metadata group that automatically replaces a previously input version (or that also deletes the 
previous version). However, providing that ability might be cost-effective and is allowed. Without that 
ability, any client not wishing to retain the previously input version can later delete the previous version. 

NOTE 2 Although possible, "simultaneous" input of two or more new modified versions is expected to 
be rare. However, when "simultaneous" or sequential input of multiple modified versions occurs, each 
modified version will normally be useful to the client that inputs it. 

d) This operation(s) can also allow input of updated or corrected versions of previously 
input data and/or metadata groups. When an updated version is input, the updated 
version shall be stored and shall be retrievable, and the previously input version(s) 
shall be automatically deleted. If two or more updated versions are input 
"simultaneously", conflicts between these updates shall be avoided as appropriate. 

e) This operation(s) shall allow input of images and image metadata plus other types of 
geospatial data and metadata that are stored in the same archive server instance. 

f) The allowed input format(s) shall include XML encoded data and metadata, and that 
XML encoding shall be based on GML wherever applicable. 

g) The XML encoded input formats allowed shall be specified using XML Schema that 
can be retrieved using the get schema operation discussed in Subclause 5.3.3. 

h) When a new data or metadata group is input, this operation(s) shall assign a unique 
data identifier that can later be used to retrieve that object, by the get object 
operation(s) discussed in Subclause 5.3.5, and to delete that object. 

i) The data identifiers used for requirement f) shall be unique identifiers across all 
(relevant) archive server instances. 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 13
 



OGC 04-052 

j) The unique data identifiers assigned to meet requirement f) shall be compatible with 
web services. For example, each identifier can be a URN or URL. 

k) This operation(s) shall allow input of needed links between new data and metadata 
groups and previously entered data and metadata groups. 

NOTE 3 The ability to update data and metadata previously archived is not required, except for adding 
new metadata groups which are associated with previous data and metadata. In most uses, metadata group 
contents are not updated and the old values lost; instead, new metadata group values are added while the 
previous group values are retained. When modification is required, the new group values can be added and 
then the old group values can be deleted or deprecated. 

l) This operation(s) shall allow clients to request deletion (or discarding) of data and 
metadata groups currently stored by the archive server instance. 

m) The data or metadata group deleted shall be able to be selected by specifying the 
same unique data identifier as used by the get object operation(s), and which can be 
retrieved from the catalog service discussed in Subclause 5.4. This data identifier 
should also be included in the metadata stored in the image archive service. 

n) This operation(s) should be required implementation by all compliant archive server 
instances. 

NOTE 4 This operation(s) should be required implementation in the image archiving interface 
specification(s) prepared under OWS 1.2. That is, an archive server instance which does not (fully) 
implement this operation(s) can be considered compliant with the specification, but at a compliance level 
less that a server which implements this operation(s). However, all the image archiving server components 
implemented in the OWS 1.2 testbed shall implement this operation(s). 

This input and delete data operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) Transaction operation of the WFS, WRS, or WOS. 

b) Input and delete metadata operation(s) of the catalog services described in Subclause 
5.4.4. 

5.3.5 Get object 

The archive function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following data and metadata retrieval requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve selected data and/or metadata groups 
currently stored by the archive server instance. 

b) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving images and image metadata plus other types 
of geospatial data and metadata that are stored in the same archive server instance. 

c) This operation(s) shall allow retrieval of the entire unaltered image, with all its 
metadata that is stored in that archive. The metadata stored in that archive can include 
all or any of the metadata that is not useful for searching (and is thus not required to 

14 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 



OGC 04-052 

be stored in the catalog), especially the detailed metadata needed to support image 
exploitation. This metadata can also include all or any of the metadata that is useful 
for searching, and is thus also stored in the catalog service(s). 

d) This operation(s) shall allow retrieval of a selected subset of the metadata groups that 
are stored in that archive for an image. This operation(s) should also allow retrieval of 
the entire image with the selected metadata. 

e) The data or metadata group retrieved shall be able to be selected by specifying the 
data identifier which can be retrieved (with other metadata) from the catalog service 
discussed in Subclause 5.4. This data identifier can also be included in the metadata 
stored in the image archive service. 

f) The data or metadata group retrieved should also be able to be selected by specifying 
a filter expression based on the Filter Encoding Implementation Specification, 
modified as needed. If provided, this query ability should support searches of an 
archive containing up to about 10**6 entries. Furthermore, this operation(s) shall 
support the iterative refinement of a filter expression, and should do so without 
requiring the client to cache the query. 

g) This operation(s) shall automatically follow the stored links that connect all the 
metadata groups for one cataloged object, for retrieved data and metadata selection as 
specified in items c) through f). 

h) When multiple versions of a data or metadata group are currently stored, this 
operation(s) shall allow either the latest or all versions to be selected and/or retrieved 
as specified in items c) through g). This operation(s) should also allow a specified 
previous version to be selected and/or retrieved. 

i) The data identifiers used for requirement e) shall be unique identifiers across all 
(relevant) archive and catalog server instances. 

j) The allowed output format(s) shall at least include XML encoded data and metadata, 
and that XML encoding shall be based on GML wherever applicable. 

k) The XML encoded output formats allowed shall be specified using XML Schema, 
that can be retrieved using the get schema operation discussed in Subclause 5.3.3. 
Those XML Schema shall be GML application schema wherever applicable. 

l) This operation(s) shall be required implementation by all compliant archive server 
instances. 

This get object operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) GetFeature operation of the WFS or the GetObject operation of the WOS. 

b) Query metadata operation(s) of the catalog services described in Subclause 5.4.5.

OGC 04-052 

5.3.6 Get coverage (optional) 

The image archive function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that 
together meet the coverage data retrieval following requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve a selected subset of the stored image 
or other coverage. This operation(s) should allow resampling of the selected grid 
coverage subset, as needed to obtain an output grid spacing different from the stored 
grid spacing. This operation(s) should also allow clients to retrieve the entire 
unaltered stored image or other coverage. In all cases, this retrieval can be without 
most of the image metadata that is stored in that archive server instance. 

b) The coverage subsets allowed in requirement a) shall include both domain (usually 
spatial-temporal) and range subsets, including domain and range combinations. 

c) The coverage from which a subset is retrieved shall be able to be selected by 
specifying the data identifier which can be retrieved from the catalog service 
discussed in Subclause 5.4. This data identifier can also be included in the metadata 
stored in the image archive service. In addition, the coverage may be able to be 
selected by specifying a filter expression based on the Filter Encoding 
Implementation Specification, modified as needed. That filter expression should be 
applied to the coverage metadata stored by the archive server instance. 

d) The data identifiers used for requirement c) shall be unique identifiers across all 
(relevant) archive and catalog server instances. 

e) The client specification of the coverage subset to be retrieved shall be based on 
coverage metadata that is stored with the coverage in the same archive server 
instance, and can be retrieved using the get object operation(s) discussed in Subclause 
5.3.5. This coverage metadata can also be included in the metadata stored in catalog 
server instance(s). 

f) This operation(s) shall also be able to output metadata describing the coverage subset 
that is actually output. 

g) The allowed metadata output format(s) shall include XML encoded metadata, and 
that XML encoding shall be based on GML wherever applicable. 

h) The XML encoded output formats allowed shall be specified using XML Schema, 
including GML application schema where applicable. 

i) This operation(s) shall be optional implementation by a compliant archive server 
instance. 

NOTE  This operation(s) shall be optional implementation in the image archiving interface 
specification(s) prepared under OWS 1.2. That is, an archive server instance which does not (fully) 
implement this operation(s) should be considered compliant with the specification, but at a compliance 
level less that a server which implements this operation(s). However, all the image archiving server 
components implemented in the OWS 1.2 testbed are expected to implement this operation(s).

This get coverage operation(s) should be as similar as practical to either the 

a) GetCoverage operation of the (draft) WCS or the GetFeature operation of the WFS. 

b) Get object operation(s) of the archive service, discussed in Subclause 5.3.5. 

5.3.7 Get map (optional) 

The image archive function interface(s) can provide one or more operations that together 
meet the following coverage data portrayal requirements, if such operation(s) are 
specified: 

NOTE  If not included in OWS 1.2, this get map functionality is expected to be required in a later OWS 
testbed. Therefore, decisions should not be made in OWS 1.2 that would make it more difficult to include 
this get map functionality. 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve an image map portraying a selected 
subset of the stored image or other coverage. This operation(s) shall allow resampling 
of the selected image subset, as needed to obtain an image map pixel spacing 
different from the stored grid spacing. 

b) The portrayal used in a retrieved image map shall be specified using SLD, modified 
as needed. 

c) The coverage from which a subset is retrieved shall be able to be selected by 
specifying the data identifier which can be retrieved from the catalog service 
discussed in Subclause 5.4. This data identifier can also be included in the metadata 
stored in the image archive server instance. 

d) The data identifiers used for requirement c) shall be unique identifiers across all 
(relevant) archive and catalog server instances. 

e) The client specification of the coverage subset to be retrieved shall be based on 
coverage metadata that is stored with the coverage in the same archive service, and 
can be retrieved using the get object operation(s) discussed in Subclause 5.3.5. 

f) This operation(s) shall be optional implementation by a compliant archive server 
instance. 

NOTE  This operation(s) shall be optional implementation in the image archiving interface 
specification(s) prepared under OWS 1.2. That is, an archive server instance which does not (fully) 
implement this operation(s) should be considered compliant with the specification, but at a compliance 
level less that a server which implements this operation(s). However, some of the image archiving server 
components implemented in the OWS 1.2 testbed are expected to implement this operation(s). 

If such operation(s) are specified, this get map operation(s) should be as similar as 
practical to both the: 

a) GetMap operation of the WMS.

b) Get coverage operation(s) of the archive service, discussed in Subclause 5.3.6. 

5.4 Image catalog requirements 

5.4.1 Introduction 

This subclause specifies the more-specific requirements for the image catalog function 
interface(s) that are specified in OWS 1.2, in addition to the common requirements 
specified in Subclause 5.2. This subclause specifies that a set of web service operations 
be provided by one or more interfaces which can be implemented by one server providing 
the required image catalog functionality. However, this subclause does not specify the: 

a) Number of those operations, or their names 

b) Number of those interfaces, or their names 

One or more interfaces shall be specified that, when all implemented by one catalog 
server instance, provide operations that support the functionality specified in the 
following subclauses, namely providing operations allowing: 

a) Get service metadata 

b) Get schema 

c) Input and delete metadata 

d) Query metadata 

5.4.2 Get service metadata 

The catalog function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following service metadata retrieval requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve service metadata for the catalog server 
instance. 

b) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving service metadata that describes all the 
operations implemented by the catalog server instance, providing information needed 
for a client to request those operations and use the operation responses. 

c) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving a list of all the metadata group types that can 
(currently) be retrieved from or input into the catalog server instance. This 
operation(s) shall not require retrieving some metadata from all of the metadata 
groups currently stored by the catalog server instance. Also, this operation(s) should 
not require retrieving the complete data schema for all of the metadata types that can 
be stored.

OGC 04-052 

d) The service metadata output(s) shall be encoded in XML. 

e) The output contents and format(s) shall be specified using XML Schema, and those 
schema(s) shall be based on GML wherever applicable. 

f) This operation(s) shall be required implementation by all compliant catalog server 
instances. 

NOTE  That is, a catalog server instance which does not (fully) implement this operation(s) shall not be 
considered compliant with the specification. All the image cataloging server components implemented in 
the OWS 1.2 testbed shall implement this operation(s). 

This get service metadata operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) GetCapabilities operation of the WFS or WRS. 

b) Get service metadata operation(s) of the catalog services described in Subclause 
5.3.2. 

5.4.3 Get schema 

The catalog function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following metadata schemas retrieval requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve the data schema(s) used for selected 
types of metadata groups that can (currently) be stored by the catalog server instance. 
This operation(s) should not always retrieve the data schema(s) for all types of 
metadata that can (currently) be stored by the catalog server instance. Also, this 
operation(s) shall not always retrieve some metadata for all instances of the type(s). 

b) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving data schemas for metadata for images and also 
for other types of geospatial data and metadata that are stored in the same archive 
server instance. 

c) The type(s) of metadata groups for which schema(s) are retrieved shall be able to be 
selected by specifying the data type identifier(s) which can be retrieved from the 
same catalog service using the get service metadata operation(s) discussed in 
Subclause 5.4.2. 

d) The schema output format shall be XML Schema, and those schema(s) shall be based 
on GML wherever applicable. 

e) This operation(s) shall be required implementation by all compliant catalog server 
instances. 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 19
 



OGC 04-052 

This get schema operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) DescribeFeatureType operation of the WFS or DescribeRecord operation of the 
WRS. 

b) Get schema operation(s) of the archive services described in Subclause 5.3.3. 

5.4.4 Input and delete metadata 

The catalog function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following metadata input and management requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to input new metadata groups that will be stored 
by the archive server instance. 

b) This operation(s) shall allow input of entire new metadata groups that are provided as 
operation input parameters. 

c) This operation(s) shall allow input of modified versions of previously input metadata 
groups, where entire groups are provided as operation input parameters. When a new 
modified version is input, both the modified version and the previously input 
version(s) of that metadata group shall be stored and shall be queryable and 
retrievable. If two or more modified versions are input "simultaneously", all the new 
versions shall be stored and shall be retrievable. 

NOTE 1 Both the new version and the previously input version(s) are expected to be required to be 
stored indefinitely by many catalog applications. However, indefinitely storing previous version(s) will not 
always be required by an application. There is no requirement to allow input of a modified version of a 
metadata group that automatically replaces a previously input version (or that also deletes the previous 
version). However, providing that ability might be cost-effective and is allowed. Without that ability, any 
client not wishing to retain the previously input version can later delete the previous version. 

NOTE 2 Although possible, "simultaneous" input of two or more modified versions is expected to be 
rare. However, when "simultaneous" or sequential input of multiple modified versions occurs, each 
modified version will normally be useful to the client that inputs it. 

d) This operation(s) can also allow input of updated or corrected versions of previously 
input metadata groups. When an updated version is input, the updated version shall be 
stored and shall be retrievable, and the previously input version shall be automatically 
deleted. If two or more updated versions are input "simultaneously", conflicts 
between these updates shall be avoided as appropriate. 

e) This operation(s) shall allow input of image metadata and also metadata for other 
types of geospatial data that are stored in the same catalog server instance. 

f) The input metadata shall be encoded in XML, and that XML encoding shall be based 
on GML wherever applicable. 

20 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 



OGC 04-052 

g) The XML encoded input formats allowed shall be specified using XML Schema that 
can be retrieved using the get schema operation discussed in Subclause 5.4.3. 

h) When a new metadata group is input, this operation(s) shall assign a unique metadata 
identifier that can later be used to retrieve that object, by the query metadata 
operation(s) discussed in Subclause 5.4.5, and to delete that object. 

i) The metadata identifiers used for requirement f) shall be unique identifiers across all 
(relevant) catalog server instances. 

j) The unique metadata identifiers assigned to meet requirement f) shall be compatible 
with web services. For example, each identifier can be a URN or URL. 

k) This operation(s) shall allow input of needed links between new metadata groups and 
previously entered metadata groups. 

NOTE 3 The ability to update metadata previously cataloged is not required, except for adding new 
metadata groups which are associated with previous metadata. In many uses, metadata group contents are 
not updated and the old values lost; instead, new metadata group values are added while the previous group 
values are retained. When modification is required, the new group values can be added and then the old 
group values can be deleted or deprecated. 

l) This operation(s) shall allow clients to request deletion (or discarding) of metadata 
groups currently stored by the archive server instance. 

m) The metadata group deleted shall be able to be selected by specifying the same unique 
metadata identifier as used by the query metadata operation(s) discussed in Subclause 
5.4.5, and which can be previously retrieved from the same catalog server instance. 

n) This operation(s) should be required implementation by all compliant catalog server 
instances. 

NOTE 4 This operation(s) should be required implementation in the image cataloging interface 
specification(s) prepared under OWS 1.2. That is, a catalog server instance which does not (fully) 
implement this operation(s) can be considered compliant with the specification, but at a compliance level 
less that a server which implements this operation(s). However, all the image cataloging server components 
implemented in the OWS 1.2 testbed shall implement this operation(s). 

This input and delete metadata operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) Transaction operation of the WFS or WRS. 

b) Input and delete object operation(s) of the archive services described in Subclause 
5.3.4.

OGC 04-052 

5.4.5 Query metadata 

The catalog function interface(s) shall provide one or more operations that together meet 
the following metadata query and retrieval requirements: 

a) This operation(s) shall allow clients to retrieve selected metadata groups currently 
stored by the catalog server instance. 

b) The metadata retrieved for cataloged objects shall be able to be selected by a query 
expression based on the Filter Encoding Implementation Specification, modified as 
needed. 

c) The metadata query ability of requirement b) shall support searches of a catalog 
containing up to about 10**6 entries. 

d) This operation(s) shall support the iterative refinement of a query, and should do so 
without requiring the client to cache the query. 

e) A retrieved metadata group shall also be able to be selected by specifying a metadata 
group identifier which can be previously retrieved from the same catalog service. 

f) The metadata identifiers used for requirement e) shall be unique identifiers across all 
(relevant) catalog server instances. 

g) This operation(s) shall allow retrieval of all the metadata that is stored in the catalog 
for each selected cataloged object. 

h) This operation(s) shall also allow retrieval of a selected portions of the complete 
metadata that is stored in the catalog for each selected cataloged object. 

i) This operation(s) shall automatically follow the stored links that relate all the 
metadata groups for one cataloged object, for object selection as specified in item b) 
and for retrieved metadata selection as specified in item g). 

j) When multiple versions of a metadata group are currently stored, this operation(s) 
shall allow either the latest or all versions to be selected and/or retrieved as specified 
in items b) and g) through i). This operation(s) should also allow a specified previous 
version to be selected and/or retrieved. 

k) This operation(s) shall allow retrieving image metadata and also metadata for other 
types of geospatial data that are stored in the same archive server instance. This 
operation(s) should also allow retrieving metadata for services and other information 
objects, when stored in the same catalog server instance. 

l) The metadata output(s) shall be encoded in XML, and that XML encoding shall be 
based on GML wherever applicable. 

22 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 



OGC 04-052 

m) The XML encoded output formats allowed shall be specified using XML Schema, 
that can be retrieved using the get schema operation discussed in Subclause 5.4.3. 
Those XML Schema shall be GML application schema wherever applicable. 

n) This operation(s) shall be required implementation by all compliant catalog server 
instances. 

This query metadata operation(s) should be as similar as practical to both the 

a) GetFeature operation of the WFS or the GetRecord and GetRecordByID operations of 
the WRS. 

b) Get object operation(s) of the archive services described in Subclause 5.3.4. 

5.5 Image metadata requirements 

5.5.1 Introduction 

This subclause specifies the more-specific requirements for the image metadata specified 
for use in OWS 1.2, in addition to the common requirements specified in Subclause 5.2. 
These requirements are separately listed for image metadata used by catalog and archive 
servers, although many of these requirements are the same for both. 

5.5.2 Catalog metadata 

In addition to the common requirements specified in Subclause 5.2, the image metadata 
specified for use by OWS 1.2 catalog servers shall meet all the following requirements: 

a) The catalog metadata shall be transferred between clients and servers using XML 
encoding, with the correct encoding and contents specified using XML Schema. 

b) The catalog metadata should adapt OGC Abstract Specification new Topic 11 (which 
contains ISO/DIS 19115) to adequately describe all the categories and types of 
images handled in OWS 1.2. Such adaptation means selecting a suitable subset of this 
metadata, and extending that metadata as needed for effective query and retrieval. 

NOTE  The "Future Work" clause of OGC document 01-053r1 was accepted as an addition  to the 
Abstract Specification new Topic 11, but has not yet been physically included  in Topic 11. Among other 
things, that clause states that the “Reference system information” parts of ISO 19115 need to be  modified 
to be more consistent with the new Abstract Specification Topic 2. 

c) The catalog metadata should use GML and XML encoding of OGC Abstract 
Specification Topic 2, wherever applicable, especially for coordinate reference 
systems and coordinate operations.  

d) The catalog metadata should adapt the FGDC Remote Sensing Extensions as needed 
to adequately describe all the categories and types of images handled in OWS 1.2. 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 23
 



OGC 04-052 

The catalog metadata should also use SensorML where applicable and not 
contradictory. 

e) The catalog metadata that can be queried shall be distinguished from the catalog 
metadata that can only be retrieved. All the catalog metadata that can be queried 
should also be able to be retrieved. 

f) The catalog metadata shall be divided into two or more metadata groups suitable for 
input at different times. Also, separate metadata groups shall be defined for metadata 
that is applicable to many images and for metadata that is applicable to single images. 

5.5.3 Archive metadata 

In addition to the common requirements specified in Subclause 5.2, the image metadata 
specified for use by OWS 1.2 archive servers shall meet all the following requirements: 

a) The catalog metadata shall be transferred between clients and servers using XML 
encoding, with the correct encoding and contents specified using XML Schema. 

b) The archive metadata should adapt OGC Abstract Specification new Topic 11 (which 
contains ISO/DIS 19115) to adequately describe all the categories and types of 
images handled in OWS 1.2. Such adaptation means selecting a suitable subset of this 
metadata, and extending that metadata as needed for effective query and retrieval. 

NOTE  The "Future Work" clause of OGC document 01-053r1 was accepted as an addition  to the 
Abstract Specification new Topic 11, but has not yet been physically included  in Topic 11. Among other 
things, that clause states that the “Reference system information” parts of ISO 19115 need to be  modified 
to be more consistent with the new Abstract Specification Topic 2. 

c) The catalog metadata should use GML and XML encoding of OGC Abstract 
Specification Topic 2, wherever applicable, especially for coordinate reference 
systems and coordinate operations.  

d) The archive metadata should adapt the FGDC Remote Sensing Extensions as needed 
to adequately describe all the categories and types of images handled in OWS 1.2. 
The catalog metadata should also use SensorML where applicable and not 
contradictory. 

e) The archive metadata shall be divided into two or more metadata groups suitable for 
input at different times. Also, separate metadata groups shall be defined for metadata 
that is applicable to many images and for metadata that is applicable to single images.

6 Design principles 

6.1.1 Introduction 

The following design principles should be considered in specifying the image archive 
interface(s), image catalog interface(s), and image metadata for the OWS 1.2 testbed. 

6.2 General 

The general design principles that should be considered include: 

a) Specified services should be as easy-as-practical for a client to use, including by the 
programmers of client software, and including clients that use a wide variety of types 
of geospatial data. 

b) Specified services should be as easy-as-practical to implement, including by the 
programmers of the server software. 

c) Specified services, interfaces, and data structures should be as easy-as-practical to 
understand, by potential specification users, client users and programmers, data 
providers, OGC members, and server programmers. 

d) Specified services should be targeted as a frequently-included part of a set of OGC 
web services. 

e) Specifications shall be testable in this testbed. A requirement of the OGC 
Interoperability Program is demonstration that all elements in a potential specification 
can be implemented. Therefore, implementation testing in the form of technology 
integration experiments must play a large part in any potential specification’s design. 

f) When a potential OGC Implementation Specification is developed, that specification 
shall be accompanied by a comprehensive, completed test suite. 

6.3 Compatible, consistent and extensible 

The compatibility, consistency, and extensibility design principles that should be 
considered include: 

a) Revised and new services should have client interfaces that are similar to the already-
approved OGC web services and associated data format specifications, including 
WMS, WFS, GML, SLD, and Filter Encoding. 

b) Revisions of already-approved OGC web services and associated data formats 
specifications should be maximally compatible with the previous versions. 

c) All aspects of a specification should be maximally compatible with other aspects of 
that specification. 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 25
 



OGC 04-052 

d) Specifications should be as easy-as-practical to extend, especially for expected future 
additions and improvements. 

e) Specifications should be as compliant-as-practical with the current OGC Abstract 
Specification, including Topics 2, 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, and 16. 

6.4 Relationships to other standards 

The relationships to other standards that should be considered include: 

a) Specifications should be compatible with and/or leverage W3C standards efforts such 
as HTTP, XML, XML Schema, XPointer, and Xquery. 

b) Specifications should be compatible with and/or leverage ISO/TC 211 standards and 
drafts, including ISO 19118 (Encoding), 19115 (Metadata), and 19119 (Services). 

c) Metadata should be compatible with and/or leverage FGDC metadata standards, 
including the draft extensions for remote sensing images. 

d) Clients and service implementations should be able to conform to Web accessibility 
standards (such as those of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Content 
Guidelines).

8 Technical terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the following technical terms and definitions apply: 

8.1  
Cartesian coordinate system 
coordinate system which gives the position of points relative to N mutually perpendicular 
straight axes 

NOTE In the context of geospatial coordinates the maximum value of N is three. 

8.2  
coordinate 
one of a sequence of N numbers designating the position of a point in N-dimensional 
space 

NOTE In a coordinate reference system, the coordinate numbers must be qualified by units. 

8.3  
coordinate reference system 
coordinate system which is related to the real world by a datum 

NOTE For geodetic and vertical datums, it will be related to the Earth. 

8.4  
coordinate system 
set of coordinate axes, with defined or implied metric, used to record point coordinates in 
a coordinate reference system 

NOTE One coordinate system may be used in many coordinate reference systems. 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 27
 



OGC 04-052 

8.5  
coordinate transformation 
computational process of converting a position given in one coordinate reference system 
into the corresponding position in another coordinate reference system 

NOTE 1 A coordinate transformation can require and use the parameters of the ellipsoids associated 
with the source and target coordinate reference systems, in addition to the parameters explicitly associated 
with the transformation. 

NOTE 2 The term ‘transformation’ is used only when the parameter values associated with the 
transformation have been determined empirically from a measurement / calculation process. This is 
typically the case when a change of datum is involved. 

8.6  
coverage 
object that uses a coverage function to return one or more attribute values for any direct 
position within its spatiotemporal range 

8.7  
data schema 
definition of data (or metadata) contents, meanings, structure, and encoding 

NOTE  In this document, a model of data encoded in XML is defined by one or more XML Schemas 
for that data. Data item and group meanings are normally defined by text, in Documentation elements in the 
XML Schemas and in explicitly referenced documents. 

8.8  

derived image 
new image produced by subsetting and/or resampling the pixels in an original image 

8.9  
elevation 
distance of a point from a chosen reference surface along the direction of the gravity 
vector from the point to that surface. 

NOTE 1 See ellipsoidal height and gravity-related height. It should be noted that ellipsoidal height is 
defined w.r.t. an ellipsoidal model of the shape of the earth. Ellipsoidal height is measured from the point 
along the line perpendicular to the ellipsoid’s surface. 

NOTE 2 Height of a point outside the surface treated as positive; negative height is also named as depth. 

8.10  
feature (in GML) 
abstraction of real world phenomena 

8.11  
frame camera 
camera in which an entire frame or format is exposed through a lens that is fixed relative 
to the focal plane 

28 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 



OGC 04-052 

8.12  
geographic coordinate reference system 
coordinate reference system using an ellipsoidal coordinate system and based on an 
ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth 

NOTE  A geographic coordinate system can be 2D or 3D. In a 3D geographic coordinate system, the third 
dimension is height above the ellipsoid surface. 

8.13  

georeferenced image 
image where the image position that corresponds to any ground position covered by that 
image can be computed using an image geometry model or other coordinate 
transformation 

NOTE  Most images being exploited are georeferenced, at least approximately. Georeferenced implies 
that the sensor position and pointing directions at the time of image collection are known, with some degree 
of accuracy. For a two-dimensional image (the normal type), the image coordinate reference system is 2D. 
However, the ground coordinates are always 3D. The 3D ground coordinates are “projected” into 2D image 
coordinates using an image projection. 

8.14  
ground coordinates 
coordinates of points measured in a non-image coordinate reference system 

NOTE  The term ground coordinates is used herein to distinguish such coordinates from image 
coordinates. Even when an image is collected by a near vertical camera, image coordinates are different 
from ground coordinates! 

8.15  
image 
record of the likeness of any features, objects, and activities 

NOTE  An image can be acquired through the sensing of visual or any other segment of the 
electromagnetic spectrum by sensors, such as thermal infrared, and high resolution radar. An image can 
also be acquired outside the electromagnetic spectrum, e.g., sonar and seismic images. 

8.16  
image archive 
repository of image data and some associated metadata 

8.17  
image catalog 
registry of metadata about images 

8.18  
image compression  
operation that, through various techniques, reduces the quantity of stored data needed to 
represent a digital image 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 29
 



OGC 04-052 

8.19  
image coordinates 
definition of position within an image, expressed in image row and column coordinates 

8.20  
image exploitation  
evaluation of an image or multiple images to extract the information contained within the 
image(s) as it pertains to a specific list of questions or general categories of questions 

NOTE  Exploitation may result in the creation of a report or product to disseminate the information, 
whether disseminated to a requester or to a database. 

8.21  
image footprint 
polygon outline of ground area covered by an image, often stored as image metadata 

8.22  
image geometry model 
mathematical model that specifies the mapping (or projection) from 3D ground position 
coordinates to the corresponding 2D image position coordinates 

NOTE 1 An image geometry model is alternately called an image sensor model, sensor model, imaging 
model, or image mathematical model. The term “sensor” is often used when the image is generated by a 
digital camera and is thus originally digital. The word “camera” is usually used when the image is recorded 
in analog form, normally on film. Of course, film images can be later scanned or digitized and are then 
“digital”. 
  
NOTE 2 An image geometry model can also be used to determine the correct ground position for an 
image position, if used with additional data. When a single (or monoscopic) image is used, this additional 
data normally defines the shape and position of the visible ground (or object) surface. For example, this 
additional data is often a single elevation or is grid elevation data, sometimes called a Digital Terrain 
Model (DTM). Alternately, two stereoscopic images or multiple overlapping images can be used, that show 
the same ground point viewed from different directions. In this case, the two (or more) image geometry 
mathematical models can also be used, with the point coordinates in each individual image, to determine 
the corresponding 3D ground position. 

8.23  

image resolution 
degree of detail visible in an image 

8.24  
image tile  
part of an image based on rectangular or square image areas 

8.25  
imagery client 
computer software that retrieves images and image metadata from image archives and 
catalogs, to process or use those images

OGC 04-052 

8.26  
interface 
named set of operations that characterise the behaviour of an element 

8.27  

metadata  
data about the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data 

8.28  
metadata group 
group of metadata that is input as one group at one time 

NOTE  Metadata items are placed in different groups when they are expected to be input, or be updated 
by inputting a new version, at different times. For example, metadata that is common to multiple images, 
including a collection of images, is separated from metadata that differs for each image. Catalog-stored 
metadata is also separated from archive-stored metadata. 

8.29  
monoscopic image 
a single image taken of a target 

8.30  
mosaicked image 
image mosaic 
an image that combines two or more previously separate images 

8.31  
order of magnitude

Annex A 
(informative) 

 
Image handling use cases 

A.1 Overview 

This annex provides a set of use cases that illustrate potential applications of products 
implementing the OWS 1.2 image handling and other specifications. These use cases are 
modularized into three levels of detail: 

a) The top level use cases describe image handling applications at a high level. This 
annex includes four such use cases; and references additional top level use cases 
described in other documents. In addition, some steps in the listed second level use 
cases could be described in more detail as additional top level use cases. 

b) The second level use cases describe image handling applications at a more detailed 
level. These three use cases are used by all or most top level use cases. 

c) The third level use cases provide still more detail about the service calls and data 
transfers by which clients use the image handling software components. These three 
third level use cases are used by the second level use cases. 

The third level use cases are described first, since they are more directly relevant to the 
requirements for the image archive and catalog service interfaces. The second level use 
cases are then described, followed by the top level use cases. 

A.2 Third level use cases 

A.2.1 Introduction 

These third level use cases provide a detailed description of the software component 
requests and data transfers needed to support second-level use cases. In these third level 
use cases, the use case steps describing direct interaction between a client and the OWS 
interfaces are marked "(Note 1)". Multiple archives and catalogs could be used in a single 
use case step. Notice that all of these third level use cases are applied to multiple types of 
data, and are essentially independent of the types of data being handled. 

These three third level use cases would normally be used in the sequence in which they 
are described below. These use cases are described separately because they would usually 
be interleaved with activities not directly involving data catalogs and archives, as 
indicated in the second level use cases. Also, these use cases would sometimes be 
repeated in higher level use cases. Note that these three use cases might be performed by

OGC 04-052 

different clients, users, and/or actors. Indeed, different steps in one use case could be 
performed by different clients, users, and/or actors. 

Much of the information needed by a client to perform each of these third level use cases 
is provided by the top level or second level use case which is currently using this third 
level use case. That is, much of the needed information is provided by the context 
provided by that higher level use case. 

A.2.2 Put data into archives and catalogs 

The "Put data into archives and catalogs" use case is described in Table A.1. 

Table A.1 — Put data into archives and catalogs use case 

Use case description 
Name Put data into archives and catalogs 
Priority High (third level use case that directly interacts with image archive and catalog services) 
Description Client inputs image or other data and associated metadata into archive(s) and catalog(s). 
Precondition The data and associated metadata to be stored are already known by the client, from the 

higher level use case that uses this use case. All the relevant data and metadata types are 
also already known by the client (or can be determined from data and metadata item 
names). 
The needed data archive and catalog servers are available and already known by the 
client, and they support data schemas for all needed types of data and metadata. These 
archive and catalog servers may already store some of the needed metadata. 

Flow of events – basic path 
1)  Client gets the data schema(s) for data and archive metadata to be stored (Note 1) 
2)  If needed, client gets the data schema(s) for catalog metadata to be stored (Note 1) 
3)  Client checks that new data complies with the data schema(s)

5)  If needed, client puts data and/or metadata into archive(s) (Note 1) 
6)  Client links newly archived data and/or metadata to previous data (Notes 1 and 2) 
7)  Client verifies that new data is recorded in archive(s) (Note 1) 
8)  If needed, client puts new metadata into catalog(s) (Note 1) 
9)  Client links newly cataloged metadata to previous metadata (Notes 1 and 2) 
10)  Client verifies that new metadata is recorded in catalog(s) (Note 1)

 (none) 

Postcondition The client data and/or metadata are stored in needed data archive(s) and catalog(s). 
NOTE 1 Client directly interacts with server(s) through OWS interfaces in this use case step. 
NOTE 2 This use case step assumes that the client must initiate and supply information for linking new 
metadata to previous metadata.

client, and they support data schemas for all needed types of data and metadata. These 
archive and catalog servers already store all of the needed data and metadata, and the 
client already has the identifiers and knows the archive(s) or catalog(s) which store that 
data and/or metadata. 

Flow of events – basic path

A.3 Second level use cases 

A.3.1 Introduction 

These second level use cases provide a more-detailed description of key steps needed to 
perform the tasks outlined in the top level use cases. The OWS 1.2 testbed is defining 
application interfaces for image archives and catalogs. In these second level use cases, 
the use case steps describing direct interaction using OWS interfaces are marked "(Note 
1)", while the steps that indirectly use image archive and catalog functions are marked 
"(Note 2)". For each of these direct interaction steps, the more-detailed interface requests

OGC 04-052 

and data transfers needed for utilizing image archives and catalogs are described in a 
third-level use case included in Subclause A.2. Each of these indirect interaction steps is 
much like another top level use case, that uses one or more of these second level use 
cases. 

Much of the information needed by a client to perform each of these second level use 
cases is provided by the top level use case which is currently using this second level use 
case. That is, much of the needed information is provided by the context provided by that 
higher level use case. Similarly, much of the information needed by a client to perform a 
third level use case which is used is provided by this second level use case. 

The OWS 1.2 testbed must support a high level of interoperability between software and 
hardware components used in image handling. As a result, multiple data archives and 
catalogs could be used in a single use case step. That is, the image data collected with a 
sensor could be placed into multiple image archives, and the metadata collected could be 
placed into multiple catalogs and archives. Image query and retrieval would then involve 
using multiple archives and catalogs, connected by a network such as the Internet. 

A.3.2 Provide images to archives

A.4.2 Agricultural irrigation use case 

The "Agricultural irrigation" use case is described in Table A.7. 

NOTE  This use case is similar to the Farmer use case in Section 2.1.2.2 of OGC Abstract Specification 
Topic 15: Image Exploitation Services. 

Table A.7 — Agricultural irrigation use case 

Use case description 
Name Agricultural irrigation 
Priority Low (top level use case that uses second and third level use cases to interact with image 

archive and catalog services) 
Description Agricultural company buys and exploits images to determine irrigation needs of crop 

fields in central California. 
Precondition Suitable data archive and catalog servers are available to the companies involved, and 

they support data schemas for all needed types of data and metadata. The needed data 
and metadata types are also already known by these companies. The available archive 
and catalog servers may already store some of the needed metadata and data. 

Flow of events – basic path 
1)  An agricultural company hires a mapping company to collect images of their crop fields 

in central California. 
2)  The mapping company collects digital images of specified crop fields. 
3)  The mapping company inputs the collected images into a data archive connected to the 

Internet 
4)  The mapping company places metadata for collected images in a data catalog, and 

perhaps an archive, connected to the Internet. That metadata includes the relevant image 
collection conditions, such as time of the day, cloud cover, sun direction. etc. 

5)  The agricultural company accesses the data catalog through the Internet, and searches it 
for images taken in areas on dates needed to estimate field irrigation patterns. For 
example, the catalog search might produce five image IDs that the agricultural company 
later uses to retrieve these images from the archive.  

6)  The agricultural company retrieves the needed images from the data archive. 
7)  If needed for following step(s), the agricultural company georectifies and perhaps 

mosaics the retrieved images, using image georeferencing metadata. 
8)  The agricultural company evaluates the images to determine irrigation needs. This 

information allows the agricultural company to improve field irrigation and to increase 
productivity. (Note 1) 

Flow of events – alternative paths 
 (none) 

Postcondition Agricultural company has determined irrigation needs for selected crop fields. 
NOTE 1 Georectified images are likely to be needed in this step if two or more images must be directly 
compared. Whether georectified or georeferenced images are used, image georeferencing metadata is 
likely to be used in this step, to convert image coordinates to ground coordinates and/or to convert ground 
coordinates to image coordinates.

status of outgoing routes and traffic flow. Escape routes are modified as needed. (Note 2)

 This use case could be extended to include monitoring of flood stages, damage 

assessment, recovery efforts, etc. Of course, aerial photography will grow increasingly 
difficult to obtain as weather conditions degenerate. Also, other satellite platforms, such 
as NOAA’s AMSU may be available to monitor the tropical system. The availability of 
this data is more limited, however, as these platforms are polar arbiters, and will only 
cross the ROI twice daily. 

Postcondition Command center monitors approaching tropical storm, assesses the potential danger, and 
determines the best routes for escape if necessary.

A.4.6 Abstract Specification Topic 15 use cases 

Eight relevant top level use cases are described in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 15: 
Image Exploitation Services. To minimize redundancy, these eight use cases are not 
copied or reformatted here. Section 2.1.1 of the Topic 15 describes three use cases in 
which information consumers could perform activities that use image exploitation 
services. Section 2.1.2 of the Topic 15 describes a set of five use cases from the 
geospatial information producer perspective. These five use cases show parts of a 
workflow used by information producers to extract features and other geospatial data 
from images. 

These eight use cases generally do not explicitly indicate where an image archive or 
catalog is used. However, many of the listed steps must use an image archive or catalog, 
or use metadata previously retrieved from an image catalog or archive. Section 2.1.3 of 
Topic 15 describes in more detail some of the image exploitation services used by steps 
in these eight use cases. 

A.4.7 European Union crop monitoring usage scenario 

Stephane Fellah of PCI Geomatics has posted on the OWS 1.2 portal a document file 
labeled "EU Crop monitoring Usage Scenario (full)". That document includes useful 
information for the image handling thread, common architecture thread, and common 
source thread. Because of that breadth and the document length, that document is not 
copied or paraphrased in this document. 

That usage scenario document contains information which could be included in many 
separate use cases. Many of those potential use cases would be top level use case for the 
image handling services discussed in this document. That is, these top level use cases 
would use the second and third level use cases that are discussed herein. All of the direct 
interactions with the image archiving and cataloging services discussed in this document 
would be through the same three third level use cases discussed in this document.

Annex B 
(informative) 

 
Image categories and georeferencing 

B.1 Introduction 

This annex describes and discusses some of the image categories and georeferencing 
terms used in Subclause 5.2.2. 

B.2 Original images 

The pixels in an original digital image are evenly spaced in an image coordinate reference 
system. This image coordinate reference system is usually Cartesian with a rectangular 
extent and the origin in the center or corner of the image. This image coordinate reference 
system is never a well-known ground coordinate reference system. That is, the origin of 
each image has a different position in ground space, and the axes of each image usually 
have different directions in ground space. (A coordinate transformation between an image 
coordinate reference system and a ground coordinate reference systems is usually known 
as described below, but that coordinate transformation is not part of the specification of 
the image coordinate reference system.) 

In many cases, image exploitation uses original images, not previously orthorectified 
images. Orthorectification is done by image pixel resampling, which usually reduces the 
quality of the image, by reducing the effective image resolution or reducing the ability to 
perform automated classification of multispectral images. In addition, image 
orthorectification requires elevation coverage plus significant computation resources, 
which are not always available. 

B.3 Derived images 

The simplest forms of derived images are image sections (or partial images) and reduced 
image resolutions. Other useful forms of derived images include affine warped image 
sections or entire images. Images can be derived directly from an original image or from 
a previously derived image. 

In a derived image, the pixels are evenly spaced in a different image coordinate reference 
system. This image coordinate reference system is usually Cartesian with a rectangular 
extent and the origin in the center or corner of the image. (This image coordinate 
reference system is never a well-known ground coordinate reference system. That is, the 
origin of each image has a different position in ground space, and the axes of each image 
usually have different directions in ground space.)

OGC 04-052 

In general, a set of derived images can form an acyclic directed graph rooted in a set of 
original images. That is, multiple images can be derived from one original image. A 
derived image can have multiple base images, from the same or different original images, 
although having only one base image will be most common. Similarly, the set of 
coordinate transformations for one image can be linked to form an acyclic directed graph. 
Also, a set of coordinate transformations revisions can be linked to form an acyclic 
directed graph rooted in a set of original coordinate transformations. 

B.4 Orthorectified images 

An orthorectified image is not considered to be a derived image in this document. 
Orthorectified images have image pixels resampled into a grid coordinate reference 
system (usually not into a well-known ground coordinate reference system). A grid 
coordinate reference system is usually a derived coordinate reference system of type 
"engineering", which has a specified coordinate transformation from a well-known 
ground coordinate reference system. Alternately, a grid coordinate reference system can 
be a specialized engineering coordinate reference system used for a grid of points. This 
grid coordinate reference system is usually Cartesian with a rectangular extent. 

NOTE  This document includes the term "orthorectified image" because that term is often used in 
photogrammetry, and is currently used in the OGC Abstract Specification. Subclause 7.3.2 of the current 
working draft for ISO 19129 (OGC document 02-002) uses the term "georectified" image to mean almost 
the same thing. However, a georectified image can be a mosaicked combination of multiple original 
images, while an orthorectified image is produced from a single original image. 

Orthorectification uses some form of image geometry model plus an elevation coverage. 
For a suitably flat portion of the earth's surface, rectification (using a fixed elevation 
instead of an elevation coverage) can be substituted for orthorectification. An 
orthorectified image is usually georeferenced, but exceptions are possible. 

B.5 Image mosaics 

In some applications, the number of images can be reduced by creating an image mosaic 
combining many discrete images. The multiple images are usually each orthorectified 
before they are combined. An image mosaic is usually georeferenced, but exceptions are 
possible. 

From a users point of view, dealing with multiple images can make it difficult to use the 
data. A seamless image mosaic over some geographic extent often can be produced and 
will reduce the number of images, but some image quality is sacrificed. That is, the image 
quality is degraded by the resampling and combining performed in mosaicking. There is 
thus a tradeoff between ease of use and high image quality. If the quality of the seamless 
mosaic exceeds that needed for a task, then the mosaic would usually be preferred over 
the multiple images. In other cases, the higher quality is required, and mosaicking is not 
an option.

OGC 04-052 

B.6 Elevation coverages 

An elevation coverage is often used with one (monoscopic) image position to determine 
the corresponding 3D ground position, using the image geometry model. Alternately, a 
constant-elevation surface is sometimes used. That is, the image position and image 
geometry model can be used to find the imaging ray in 3D ground space. This imaging 
ray is then (virtually) intersected with the ground surface defined by the elevation 
coverage. 

The simplest form of elevation coverage is grid elevation data, and only grid elevations 
are required to be used in this thread set. In the longer term, Triangulated Irregular 
Network (TIN) and other types of elevation coverages should be allowed. For some 
purposes, grid or TIN elevation data can be usefully supplemented by 3D digital feature 
data. Such digital feature data can be used to describe objects that sit on top the basic 
ground surface represented by the elevation coverage, or to define surface break lines and 
points (i.e., geomorphic features). 

B.7 Georeferenced images 

An original, derived, orthorectified, or mosaicked image can be georeferenced or 
ungeoreferenced. A georeferenced image has at least one known coordinate 
transformation between the image or grid coordinate reference system and an identified 
ground coordinate reference system. Such a coordinate transformation (or coordinate 
operation) uses parameters with values specific to that image. (That coordinate 
transformation is usually not part of the specification of the image coordinate reference 
system. However, that coordinate transformation is likely to be part of the specification 
of the grid coordinate reference system for an orthorectified or mosaicked image.) 

In most cases, each original image coordinate reference system is georeferenced to a 
ground coordinate reference system using an image geometry model. This georeferencing 
is often fairly accurate (e.g., errors of a few pixel spacings), but an image may be only 
poorly georeferenced (e.g., errors of hundreds of pixel spacings). Image geometry models 
are described in Subsections 2.3 and 2.4 of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 16. (Some 
approximate image geometry models are described in Section 6 of Abstract Specification 
Topic 7.) One image will often be associated with a sequence of slightly different image 
geometry models, with improving position accuracy. 

Similarly, each derived image is referenced to the original or base image coordinate 
reference system using a parameterized coordinate transformation. The coordinate 
transformation from the base image is often used to specify the derived system, and is 
then included in the specification of the derived image coordinate reference system. 
Alternately or in addition, a derived image can be directly referenced to a ground 
coordinate reference system using an image geometry model.

OGC 04-052 

B.8 Image geometry models 

In most cases, each original image coordinate reference system is georeferenced to a 
ground coordinate reference system using an image geometry model. Each image 
geometry model specifies one or more parameterized coordinate transformations, each 
using a transformation (or operation) method. The mathematics of a basic image 
geometry model defines a transformation method that is applicable to many images. Each 
image then uses a specific set of transformation parameter values; these values capture 
the camera position and direction at the time of image exposure, plus various non-
idealities. 

B.9 Coordinate reference systems 

Position coordinates are unambiguous only when the coordinate reference system used by 
those coordinates is fully defined. A coordinate reference system is a coordinate system 
(a set of coordinate axes) that is related to the real world by a datum (which defines the 
position of the origin and the directions of the axes). Coordinate reference systems are 
defined in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2. 

This document uses the standard term "coordinate reference system" for all coordinate 
reference systems, as defined in ISO/DIS 19111 and Topic 2 of the OGC Abstract 
Specification. Some OWS interface specifications now improperly use the less precise 
ISO term "spatial reference system". That term also includes spatial referencing by 
identifier (without coordinates). Notice that a "coordinate system" is less complete and is 
just one part of a coordinate reference system. This document uses the term image 
coordinates for positions in a 2D image (coordinate reference system), and sometimes 
uses the term ground coordinates for positions in a 3D ground coordinate reference 
system. 

B.10 Coordinate transformations 

Interfaces specified and components implemented in OWS 1.2 shall support performing 
all the coordinate transformations needed to handle original and derived images. That is, 
this thread set must handle positions in original images, not already orthorectified into 
ground coordinates. This thread set can be limited to handling only one (monoscopic) 
image at a time, although handling two or more (stereoscopic) images together would be 
desirable and will ultimately be required. In addition, these components should support 
performing coordinate transformations needed to provide flexibility in the ground 
coordinate reference systems available to users of client components. 

This document currently uses the widely-used term "coordinate transformation" for all 
changing of position values from one coordinate reference system to another. The newly 
revised Topic 2 of the OGC Abstract Specification uses the ISO/DIS 19111 specified 
term "operation" for all such coordinate reference system changes. Both of those 
documents recognize two different subtypes of "operations", namely "conversions" and 
"transformations". By definition, conversions are specified with no errors, while 
transformations are specified with errors.

OGC 04-052 

A "coordinate transformation" or "operation" need not be in analytic form; it may be 
specified by a table of corresponding data values. That table may include information 
other than the location of the data points.

Annex C 
(informative) 

 
Image distribution service 

C.1 Introduction 

An image distribution service interface is also expected to be needed in the longer term. 
This distribution interface could be implemented by a separate server instance, or by a 
server that also implements the image archive, catalog, and/or other OGC interfaces. 

This image distribution service is needed to simplify clients that input image data, by 
avoiding the need for client software to input data and metadata into both image archives 
and catalogs, while keeping their contents consistent. This image distribution service is 
also needed to simplify clients that delete image data, by avoiding the need for client 
software to delete data and metadata from both image archives and catalogs, keeping 
their contents consistent. 

Specifying and implementing this image distribution service is not required in OWS 1.2. 
It is acceptable for OWS 1.2 implementations to leave all inputting of search metadata 
into appropriate catalogs up to the clients which input data into archives. It is also 
acceptable in OWS 1.2 to include a small incomplete extension of having clients input 
metadata into catalogs. Specifically, when a catalog and an archive are implemented 
together, the archive could automatically input the appropriate metadata into the (one) 
associated catalog, when data is input into that archive. In this case, the client would 
remain responsible for inputting metadata into all other appropriate catalogs. 

Having an archive automatically input appropriate metadata into the one directly 
associated catalog would be a good implementation for a small enterprise, which uses just 
this one combined catalog and archive. However, this is not sufficient in a large 
enterprise which needs multiple catalogs and archives without one-to-one associations 
between catalogs and archives. In that case, data input into an archive may need to go to 
multiple catalogs, and that set of catalogs might not include the catalog associated with 
that archive. 

It is also acceptable in OWS 1.2 to specify and implement a simplified version of a 
distribution service interface, provided that the simplified interface can be later migrated 
to a fully-capable interface. The tentative requirements for a highly-capable distribution 
service are thus discussed below. 

C.2 Image distribution requirements 

A highly-capable distribution service interface would fully support the requirements 
stated in Subclause 5.2.6 of this document. From those requirements, we can derive

OGC 04-052 

tentative requirements for a distribution service. These derived requirements tentatively 
include: 

a) A Distribution service shall automatically input data and associated metadata into a 
set of one or more Archives whenever new, modified, or updated data is received by 
that Distribution service. A Distribution service may also allow a client to initiate 
automatic input of data and associated metadata into a set of one or more additional 
Archives, for data previously received by that Distribution service. 

b) A Distribution service shall also automatically input search metadata into a set of one 
or more Catalogs whenever new, modified, or updated is received by that Distribution 
service, and that data has been successfully input into one or more Archives. A 
Distribution service should also be able to automatically input search metadata into a 
set containing zero Catalogs. A Distribution service may also allow a client to initiate 
automatic input of search metadata into a set of one or more additional Catalogs, for 
data previously received by that Distribution service. 

c) The distribution of new images among multiple catalogs and archives shall be flexible 
to meet dynamically changing enterprise needs and constraints. The distribution 
criteria or policies used by the Distribution service shall thus be readily changeable to 
meet dynamically changing distribution needs and constraints. 

NOTE  The users and clients of images in a large enterprise will usually be geographically distributed. 
The multiple archives and catalogs used by a large enterprise will thus often be geographically distributed, 
partially due to communications capabilities and costs. The work responsibilities of these users, clients, and 
servers are likely to be geographically and/or organizationally correlated with their physical locations. 

d) A Distribution service shall use information input from clients specifying the set of 
Archives into which to automatically input data and associated metadata. This set of 
Archives shall be allowed to be different for each new data set that is received by that 
Distribution service. 

e) A Distribution service shall use information input from clients specifying the set of 
Catalogs into which to automatically input search metadata. This set of Catalogs shall 
be allowed to be different for each new data set that is received by that Distribution 
service. 

f) The client information specifying the sets of Archives and Catalogs into which to 
input data shall be able to be input separate from the input data and metadata, by the 
same or different clients. This client information can also be able to be provided 
combined with the input data and metadata (from the same client). 

g) The client-controllable information specifying the sets of Archives and Catalogs into 
which to input data and associated metadata shall use distribution criteria that are 
based on the values of selected image metadata. That distribution criteria shall also be 
able to use the values of other information, including the identities of archive and 
catalog servers and of clients providing the input data and metadata.

OGC 04-052 

h) A Distribution service shall automatically remove or deprecate data and associated 
metadata from all the Archives into which it put that data whenever a client requests 
that that data be removed from Archives.  

i) A Distribution service shall automatically remove or deprecate search metadata from 
all the Catalogs into which it put search metadata whenever a client requests the 
previously input data is removed from Catalogs.  

j) The requirements listed above shall all apply even when one server instance 
implements both Distribution and Archive or Catalog services. 

k) The Distribution service interface shall be specified independently of the Archive and 
Catalog interfaces, so that this service could be implemented independently of any 
archive and catalog server implementation. However, the same server instance could 
implement multiple interfaces, and this is expected to be common.
