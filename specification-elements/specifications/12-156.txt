Abstract 

The Reference Architecture Profiler (RAP) Advisor™ is a web based application that 
recommends OGC Standards and OGC Reference Model (ORM) Sections that are 
relevant to a system development; such that a community of interest could derive and 
build a profile of suitable OGC standards to meet their specific needs.  This Engineering 
Report contains the requirements, conceptual design, development methodology, and 
implementation of the RAP Advisor. 

Initial development of the RAP Advisor™ was concurrent with the OGC Web Services 
Testbed, Phase 9 (OWS-9) with NGA sponsorship.  During OWS-9 timeframe, key 
concepts of the RAP Advisor were confirmed through prototyping.  Future development 
is required to complete the functions and content of the Advisor.

What is OGC Web Services 9 (OWS-9)? 

OWS-9 builds on the outcomes of prior OGC interoperability initiatives and is organized 
around the following threads: 

-   Aviation: Develop and demonstrate the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange 
Model (AIXM) and the Weather Exchange Model (WXXM) in an OGC Web Services 
environment, focusing on support for several Single European Sky ATM Research 
(SESAR) project requirements as well as FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) 
Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) and Aircraft Access to SWIM (System 
Wide Information Management) (AAtS) requirements. 

-   Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI): Build on the CCI work accomplished in 
OWS–8 by increasing interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, 
focusing on semantic mediation, query results delivery, data provenance and quality and 
Single Point of Entry Global Gazetteer. 

-   Security and Services Interoperability (SSI): Investigate 5 main activities: Security 
Management, OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard 
Application Schema UGAS (UML to GML Application Schema) Updates, Web Services 
Façade, Reference Architecture Profiling, and Bulk Data Transfer. 

-   OWS Innovations: Explore topics that represent either new areas of work for the 
Consortium (such as GPS and Mobile Applications), a desire for new approaches to 
existing technologies to solve new challenges (such as the OGC Web Coverage Service 
(WCS) work), or some combination of the two.

-   Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation (CITE): Develop a suite of 
compliance test scripts for testing and validation of products with interfaces 
implementing the following OGC standards: Web Map Service (WMS) 1.3 Interface 
Standard, Web Feature Service (WFS) 2.0 Interface Standard, Geography Markup 
Language (GML) 3.2.1 Encoding Standard, OWS Context 1.0 (candidate encoding 
standard), Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards, Web Coverage Service for Earth 
Observation (WCS-EO) 1.0 Interface Standard, and TEAM (Test, Evaluation, And 
Measurement) Engine Capabilities.

OGC® OWS-9 Reference Architecture Profile (RAP) Advisor 
Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

Initial development of the RAP Advisor™ was concurrent with the OGC Web Services 
Testbed, Phase 9 (OWS-9) with NGA sponsorship.  During OWS-9 timeframe, key 
concepts of the RAP Advisor were confirmed through prototyping.  Future development 
is required to complete the functions and content of the Advisor.   

Usability Testing confirmed the conceptual design and operational functions.  The 
Advisor was rated as “very good” in finding relevant OGC Standards.  In general, users 
agreed the Advisor would be beneficial in their system development work.   
 
The RAP Advisor is built on the OGC Knowledge Base – the collection of databases and 
digital artifacts OGC has created and collected throughout the last 17 years.  Knowledge 
Management concepts considered in design of the RAP Advisor were: 

 Use	  multiple	  Discovery	  methods	  then	  merge	  for	  a	  comprehensive	  answer.	  
 Evaluation	  of	  discovered	  standards	  aided	  by	  information	  beyond	  the	  standards.	  
 Employ	  methods	  that	  allow	  users	  to	  relate	  OGC	  knowledge	  to	  their	  context.	  
 Summary	  Report	  to	  contain	  benefits	  from	  using	  the	  identified	  standards.	  

Users interact with the RAP Advisor through a web interface to convey their 
understanding of the scope of the system development.  Users have the option of 
selecting among three discovery methods:  

1. Navigate OGC Reference Model (ORM) sections 
2. Search on text in the ORM, and  
3. Select one of the OGC Domain Working Groups.   
 

Using these discovery methods, users select relevant OGC Standards based on their 
system application(s); selections are saved in a Profile Folder and used for the creation of 
the RAP Advisor Summary Report.   

The RAP Advisor was tested using the Joint IC/DoD Content Discovery and Retrieval 
(CDR) system development.  CDR concepts were tested on the RAP Advisor.  CDR 
experts took part in the Usability Testing. 

The version of RAP Advisor developed during OWS-9 is a prototype with further 
developments needed both in function and content.  Ideas for further development are 
included in this Engineering Report.

5  RAP Advisor overview 

The RAP Advisor was developed in the OGC Web Services Testbed, Phase 9 (OWS-9) 
with NGA sponsorship. During OWS-9, key concepts of the RAP Advisor were 
confirmed through prototyping.  Future development is required to complete the 
functions and content of the Advisor.  The overall objectives in developing the prototype 
are to:  

 Update	  the	  OGC	  Reference	  Model	  (ORM)	  
o Add/update	  based	  on	  new	  standards,	  and	  	  
o Enable	  HTML-­‐based	  web	  access	  to	  the	  document	  paragraph	  by	  

paragraph	  	  
 Web-­‐enable	  the	  ORM	  and	  build	  a	  GUI	  	  

o Such	  that	  a	  community	  of	  interest	  could	  derive	  and	  build	  a	  profile	  of	  
suitable	  OGC	  standards	  to	  meet	  their	  specific	  needs.	  	  	  

o Provide	  a	  knowledge	  base	  that	  would	  identify	  when	  or	  what	  
standards	  are	  required	  based	  on	  a	  users	  requirements	  	  	  

 Evaluate the ORM against the Intelligence Community (IC)/Department of 
Defense (DoD) Content Discovery and Retrieval (CDR) Reference Architecture.  

 
The Advisor prototype is designed as an OGC Web interface and based on three different 
discovery methods, users can select relevant OGC standards that will support their 
system applications. After a profile of OGC standards are selected, users can create a 
summary report that lists and describes their selected standards. 
 

6 Conceptual Design  

6.1 Introduction 

The Reference Architecture Profile (RAP) Advisor was developed to be a web based 
application that recommends OGC Standards and ORM Sections that are relevant to a 
system development; such that a community of interest could derive and build a profile of 
suitable OGC standards to meet their specific needs. 

The RAP Advisor was developed to interact with users through a web interface to gain 
understanding of the scope of the system development. Based on the users input on 
scope, the RAP Advisor will produce a list of relevant OGC Standards and ORM 
Sections. 

6.2 Requirements 

The RAP Advisor shall: 

- Provide	  users	  with	  a	  web	  HCI	  (human-­‐computer	  interface)	  



OGC 12-156

- Using	  the	  web	  interface,	  allow	  a	  user	  to	  communicate	  the	  scope	  of	  their	  
system	  development.	  

- Based	  on	  the	  system	  development	  scope,	  identify	  relevant	  OGC	  Standards	  
and	  ORM	  Sections.	  

- Take	  into	  account	  any	  dependency	  between	  different	  standards.	  
- Output	  a	  report	  of	  the	  identified	  OGC	  Standards	  and	  ORM	  sections	  
- Format	  of	  Report,	  e.g.,	  Excel,	  MS	  Word	  or	  PDF.	  

6.3 Design Overview 

A conceptual design for the RAP Advisor (Figure 1) was developed at the OWS-9 
Kickoff and slightly modified during the course of development.  The figure shows the 
conceptual design in particular based on a functional separation of 1) the RAP Advisor 
Human Computer Interaction (HCI) functions and 2) the RAP Advisor Reporting 
function from 3) the existing OGC Knowledge Base (KB).  The RAP Advisor 
interactions with the OGC KB are anticipated to be multifold and not all implemented in 
the initial prototype.   

Elements of the conceptual design (Figure 1) not implemented in the initial prototype 
(OWS-9) include Semantic Mediation component and access to external resources, e.g., 
DISR.

6.4 Knowledge Management considerations 

Knowledge management (KM) comprises a range of strategies and practices used in an 
organization to identify, create, represent, distribute, and enable adoption of insights and 
experiences [Wikipedia].  KM concepts were considered in the design of the RAP 
Advisor.  

The Watson/Jeopardy Project is an excellent recent example of the advances in KM that 
was reviewed for background on the RAP Advisor.  “Towards the Open Advancement of 
Question Answering Systems” – an IBM research paper describing the Watson/Jeopardy 
Project – provides concepts and possible terminology for design of KM systems.  The 
Watson Architecture [Wikipedia] shows the approach of using multiple evaluations 
merged for a single answer. 

As part of the design process, the application of KM to RAP was discussed with an OGC 
Member expert on KM1.  KM provides a broad set of concepts, e.g., Table 1 shows the 
progression of knowledge states.    

 Knowledge	  can	  be	  either	  tacit	  or	  explicit.	  The	  ORM	  and	  OGC	  standards	  
capture	  explicit	  knowledge.	  	  	  

 Conveyance	  of	  knowledge	  requires	  not	  only	  information	  transfer	  but	  also	  the	  
receiver	  must	  trust	  the	  information.	  	  It	  is	  important	  for	  OGC	  KM	  to	  think	  
beyond	  just	  the	  OGC	  standards	  to	  achieve	  conveyance	  of	  knowledge.	  	  

 The first step is Discovery of the relevant OGC KM artifacts, e.g., standards. 
 After Discovery the receiver will be making a judgment about the artifacts. Its one 

thing to identify the standards, but the RAP Advisor must also convey trust.  The 
Advisor must supply information beyond the standards for this Judgment step. 

 Conveyance of knowledge can be aided by use of Patterns.  Patterns allow for the 
receiver to see a familiar description to information that is new and foreign. 
Patterns show domain context to user. 

 
During the development it was noted by one of the reviewers that the RAP Advisor 
functionality was similar to “Shepardizing a Case” the process conducted in law to check 
the relevance of a past court decision as precedent for a current case.

The main implications on the RAP Advisor design based on considering KM were: 

1. Discovery	  step	  to	  use	  multiple	  evaluations	  methods,	  merged	  for	  a	  single	  
answer.	  

2. Judgment	  or	  evaluation	  of	  the	  discovered	  standards	  needs	  to	  be	  aided	  by	  
information	  beyond	  the	  standards.	  

3. Methods	  such	  as	  Patterns	  should	  be	  considered	  that	  allow	  for	  the	  user	  to	  
relate	  the	  OGC	  knowledge	  to	  the	  User’s	  context.	  

4. The	  Advisor	  Report	  should	  contain	  a	  benefits	  section	  about	  the	  value	  of	  using	  
the	  identified	  standards.	  

6.5 Discovery methods  

Three approaches for identifying the standards were identified: 
1. Navigate	  ORM	  structure.	  	  Provide	  a	  telescopic	  menu	  structure	  using	  the	  

outline	  of	  the	  ORM.	  	  Once	  the	  user	  selects	  a	  leaf	  in	  the	  ORM	  outline,	  the	  clause	  
is	  displayed	  along	  with	  the	  standards	  listed	  in	  the	  clauses.	  (prototyped	  in	  
Sprint	  #2	  )	  

2. Search	  the	  ORM	  text.	  Response	  to	  the	  search	  is	  the	  relevant	  ORM	  clauses	  and	  
the	  Standards	  contained	  in	  those	  clauses	  (prototyped	  in	  Sprint	  #1)	  

3. Keyword	  Checkboxes.	  Provide	  the	  user	  with	  a	  list	  of	  keywords	  that	  are	  in	  the	  
OGC	  KB.	  User	  selects	  the	  keywords	  of	  interest	  and	  submits	  request.	  Response	  
is	  the	  list	  of	  ORM	  clauses	  or	  relevant	  standards	  to	  those	  keywords.	  (During	  
development	  this	  became	  the	  Domain	  Working	  Groups	  approach	  to	  
discovery)

These methods can be used separately or in combination to identify standards. 

6.6 Report Structure 

Based on the KM considerations, the RAP Advisor Summary Report was identified to 
have two main sections: 

 Summary Table  
 ORM Sections 
 Report per Standard (1 or more reports) 

 
The content of Summary Table will be: 

 Lists of identified Standards (What if any is the grouping in this listing? 
 Standard Dependency 

 
The content of the Report per Standard 

 ORM Paragraph 
 Titles of Standard with link to each version 
 Implementation Scorecard: 

o Self-declared implementations registered - yes/no - if yes, provide link 
o Compliance test exists - yes/no - if yes, provide link 
o Compliant implementations - yes/no - if yes, provide link. 

 Titles of other OGC Document with links 
 Titles and links to other resources. 

 
The report will need to be available in several formats, e.g., 

 On a Web page of the Advisor 
 Export as MS Word .doc 

 

6.7 Relationships between Standards 

One pattern for users to understand the OGC standards was identified as a conveying the 
“relationships” between standards.  Several types of relationships were discussed in the 
design process but not all have been implemented in OWS-9. 

 Normative Reference relationship 
o As extracted from Section 3, Normative References, from the standard. 
o Not a history of the standards but rather dependency. 
o Consistency of normative reference citations in the OGC KB is addressed 

in Section 6.8.   
o Option on graphic display to show the depth of references 

§ One level: CityGML -> GML 
§ Two levels: CityGML -> GML -> XML 

 
 Provenance or Roadmap relationships 

o Beyond normative references, other relationships can be depicted between 
the OGC standards. 



OGC 12-156 

10 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

o A graphic display could be constructed of standards that share common 
concepts or that were an influence or were developed in a coordinated 
fashion. 

o These relationships are much more subjective and are not documented in 
the standard itself so creation of the links and maintenance is not part of 
the OGC standards development workflow. 

 
Graphic display of the relationships between standards is a quick and effective way for 
understanding.  Figures below depict different types of relationships.  Future work on the 
Advisor could develop a semantic ontology for the standards, e.g., Figure 3.

6.8 Normative Reference Schema 

6.8.1 Introduction 

To improve the OGC Knowledge Base a consistent schema should be used in all OGC 
Standards for normative references.  This section developed and recommends a schema 
for normative references. 

The following standards were considered in the development of a schema  
 ISO	  15836	  -­‐	  Dublin	  Core	  
 ISO	  690-­‐2,	  Information	  and	  documentation	  —	  Bibliographic	  references	  —	  

Part	  2:	  Electronic	  documents	  or	  parts	  thereof	  
 W3C	  	  
 ISO	  19115	  

 

Table 2 provides a comparison of the standards that were considered.  Dublin Core was 
used as the primary list of terms to which terms from the other standards were arranged.  
The table shows that many of the terms are similar in the standards. 
 
The recommended schema for normative references in OGC Standards is listed in Table 
3.

7 Software Development Process 

7.1 Agile development process 

Agile software development is iterative and incremental development, where 
requirements and solutions evolve [Wikipedia].  The Agile Manifesto [1] introduced the 
term in 2001.    

Scrum is one form of agile development based on Sprints.  A Sprint is restricted to a 
specific duration normally between one week and one month.  A Certified Scrum Master 
recommended the Scrum approach to agile development for use in the RAP Advisor.2 

Listed below are the Sprints conducted to develop the RAP Advisor during OWS-9. 

7.2 Content of development Sprints 

7.2.1 Sprint #1 -  July/August 2012 

Sprint 1 focused on the "Query and Format" as shown in Figure 1 where the design was 
separated in to "HCI" and "Query and Format."  Query and Format" functions developed 
in Sprint 1 were: 

 Accept	  a	  list	  of	  standards	  from	  "User	  Interaction"	  (for	  sprint	  1,	  only	  1	  standard	  need	  
be	  used	  as	  input)	  

 Query	  the	  OGC	  KB	  (portal	  plus	  other	  OGC	  databases)	  as	  well	  as	  Delicious	  index	  of	  
OGC	  articles.	  

 Create	  a	  Summary	  Report	  with	  the	  contents	  as	  defined	  in	  Section	  6.6.	  

7.2.2 Sprint #2 - August 2012 

The content of Sprint #2 was: 
 Add	  menu	  structure	  using	  ORM	  

o Consider	  the	  menu	  of	  https://nsgreg.nga.mil/overview.jsp	  
o Selecting	  leaf	  in	  outline	  returns	  ORM	  page	  and	  list	  of	  cited	  standards.	  
o Check	  boxes	  for	  each	  cited	  standard.	  
o From	  ORM	  page	  to	  Standard	  Report	  page	  for	  selected	  standards	  using	  check	  

boxes.	  
 Add	  "feedback"	  to	  Standard	  Report	  page	  form	  
 “Implementation	  Scoreboard”	  on	  Standard	  Report	  page	  

o Self-­‐declared	  implementations	  registered	  -­‐	  yes/no	  -­‐	  if	  yes,	  provide	  link	  
o Compliance	  test	  exists	  -­‐	  yes/no	  -­‐	  if	  yes,	  provide	  link	  
o Compliant	  implementations	  -­‐	  yes/no	  -­‐	  if	  yes,	  provide	  link.	  

 Bug	  fixes

During Sprint #2, the main web pages and workflow were initially developed.  A diagram 
summarizing the pages and workflow was developed in Sprint #2 and updated during 
each subsequent sprint with its current form shown in Figure 6. 

7.2.3 Sprint #3 conducted in September 2012 

Sprint #3 was the first attempt to complete the major functionality to be developed in 
OWS-9 for the RAP Advisor.  The content of Sprint #3 was 

 Implement	  the	  "Cart"	  of	  identified	  standards	  that	  can	  be	  refined	  before	  creating	  final	  
report	  (Eventually	  the	  “Cart”	  became	  the	  “Folder”)	  

 Check	  boxes	  throughout	  (no	  radio	  buttons)	  for	  selecting	  standards	  to	  be	  added	  to	  
the	  Cart	  

 Add	  List	  of	  Standards	  to	  top	  of	  Report.	  
 Executive	  summary	  in	  Export	  report	  that	  describes	  criteria	  for	  standards	  in	  Cart,	  

e.g.,	  
o List	  of	  terms	  that	  were	  used	  in	  searches.	  
o List	  of	  ORM	  paragraphs	  that	  were	  identified.	  

 Phrases	  or	  questions	  that	  suggest	  terms	  for	  query	  (stub/hardwire	  for	  semantic	  
mediation	  and	  DWG	  inputs	  in	  the	  future)	  

 Usability	  clean	  up	  ongoing,	  e.g.,	  styles	  in	  Word	  report	  

7.2.4 Sprint #4 conducted in October 2012 

Sprint #4 completed all of the major functionality developed in OWS-9 for the RAP 
Advisor.  The Content of Sprint 4 was: 

 All	  of	  the	  main	  pages	  of	  RAP	  were	  prototyped:	  1)	  Discovery,	  2)	  Results,	  3)	  
Refinement,	  4)	  Identified	  standards	  

 Refined	  "Cart/Folder"	  of	  identified	  standards	  that	  can	  be	  refined	  before	  creating	  
final	  report	  

 Dependencies	  of	  standards	  on	  other	  documents.	  	  A	  schema	  for	  reference	  documents	  
citations	  was	  created	  (see	  Section	  6.8).	  

 During	  the	  sprint,	  the	  visual	  display	  of	  Relationships	  between	  Standards	  was	  
discussed.	  	  Several	  concepts	  were	  developed	  but	  not	  implemented	  for	  OWS-­‐9	  
development	  of	  the	  Advisor.	  

 Change	  button	  on	  Results	  page	  from	  "Submit	  Query"	  to	  "Add	  to	  Report"	  or	  similar	  
term	  

 Fixed	  query	  based	  on	  phrases	  or	  terms	  listed	  on	  Discovery	  Page.	  
 Use	  of	  Domain	  WG	  names	  as	  search	  links	  
 Usability	  clean	  up	  ongoing,	  e.g.,	  styles	  in	  Word	  report	  

7.2.5 Sprint #5 conducted in November 2012 

The objective of Sprint #5 was to prepare for Usability Testing.  During this sprint the 
guided exercise listed in Annex B was initially developed.  Many small items were fixed, 
e.g., spelling and consistent labeling.

8 User interface Implementation 
8.1 User Workflow – RAP Advisor Web pages.   

Users interact with the RAP Advisor through a web interface to convey their 
understanding of the scope of the system development.  The web pages of the RAP 
Advisor User Interface are shown in Figure 6.  The figure also shows the transitions 
between the pages.   

Starting at the RAP Advisor Home Page, users have the option of selecting among three 
discovery methods:  

1. Navigate through ORM menu,  
2. Search on free text, and  
3. Select one of the Domain Working Groups.   

During each discovery process, users select relevant OGC Standards based on their 
system application(s); these selections are saved in a profile Folder and used for the 
creation of the RAP Advisor Summary Report. Users can return to the Discovery screen 
as often as necessary to check, expand and/or revise their standard selections.  After 
iteratively discovering standards of interest and adding them to the Folder, the user can 
chose to create a Summary Report.

8.2 Advisor Webpage Screenshots 

An interested user will enter the RAP Advisor web application on the Home page. The 
Home page consists of a short introduction and instructions for the RAP Advisor as well 
as a form for collection of minimal program information.  The collection of this 
information serves two purposes.  Program details collection: 

 Helps the user think through program goals and objectives so that they can better 
ask questions to the Advisor,  

 Stores associates program details and the outcomes of the Advisor into a database 
that will eventually be a resource for data-mining future RAP Advisor users.   

The user of the RAP Advisor will then be directed to the Discover page (Figure 7) and 
iterate the three methods of discovery through Evaluate page (Figure 8) to add OGC 
documents to the Profile Folder (Figure 9).  Once the user is satisfied with the collection 
of the Profile Folder then can generate a Summary Report.

8.3 Implementation Summary 

8.3.1 Implementation of Discovery Methods 

The RAP Advisor cannot assume that all users will approach discovery in the same 
manner.  Therefore, three distinct discovery methods were constructed that for users to 
find relevant OGC baseline standards and best practice documents to their proposed 
program or project.  These are each identified on the Discover page in Figure 7 – RAP 
Advisor Webpage. 

8.3.1.1 Navigation Menu 

The OGC Reference Model is outlined to be a foundational reference for the design of 
geospatially interoperable systems.  The table of contents, or menu, of the ORM then 
becomes an outline for topics and services related to geospatial systems. The RAP 
Advisor takes advantage of the ORM Menu to allow a user to browse the ORM without 
reading the entire document. The “Browse ORM Menu” is the method that shortcuts this 
process and allows the user to view the ORM in a dynamically expanding tree that will 
display the branches and nodes of the ORM menu and produce the appropriate ORM 
section in HTML when a nodes is selected. 

8.3.1.2 Free Text Search 

A text search looks for the exact words from the “Free Text Search” input box on the 
discover page from anywhere within the OGC Reference Model. A Keyword search is a 
good substitute for a subject search when you do not know where in the ORM that you 
may find what you are looking for.   

8.3.1.3 Select Domain 

This is a dynamic listing of OGC’s Domain Working Groups (DWG).  The OGC 
membership has established these Domain Working Groups as either aligning with 
industry vertical markets (such as Defense & Intelligence) or horizontal technologies 
(such as Catalogues).  The standards and best practices that an individual DWG will 
focus on can be identified and mapped.  In doing so, we can let you know that if you 
identify your program with a specific Domain from the Discovery page, the RAP Advisor 
can propose the appropriate standards for your evaluation.  

8.3.2 ORM formatting 

The OGC Reference Model (ORM) version 2.1 was written and published in Microsoft 
Word.  In order to be useful in this project, we needed to get the ORM into a format that 
would allow for simple web searching, display of individual fragments (or sections) and 
the potential for more complex natural language processing.  The ORM was converted 



OGC 12-156 

24 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

into HTML using Pandoc3 and stripped of any vendor specific tags, leaving basic HTML 
4.  Using Pandoc, section bookmarks were added (anchor tags in HTML) and the Table 
of Contents was constructed with hyperlinks to the anchor tags.  At that point the ORM 
was a single document and could be searched via modern web search technologies, but 
not broken into individual pieces for display or future editing by section. 

The ORM web page was broken into html fragments per section. Each fragment was 
placed into a database record with the corresponding metadata (i.e. ORM version, 
paragraph number scheme, etc.). This would allow for independent updates to a specific 
ORM section without rebuilding the system or modifying the code.  After each of the 
sections were databased, the ORM Table of Contents was dynamically constructed. This 
would then allow for additional ORM sections to be inserted without the need for 
additional modifications.   

8.3.3 Development Environment 

The RAP Advisor is a web application developed in PHP.  It is currently serving 
webpages via using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).  This is the 
environment of choice for the development and hosting of web applications for the OGC 
Technology Office.

8.3.4 OGC Knowledge Base 

The OGC Knowledge Base is the collection of databases and digital artifacts that the 
OGC has collected throughout the last 17 years.  It consists of public and private data 
(some data or documents are restricted to the OGC Membership or specific project 
members based upon sensitive or restrictive data, or Intellectual Property Rights) and 
includes but is not limited to: 

 Public	  OGC	  Documents	  (Standards,	  Best	  Practices,	  Engineering	  Reports)	  and	  
their	  associated	  schema	  documents	  and	  document	  metadata	  

 OGC	  Standards	  and	  Domain	  Working	  Group	  Projects	  within	  the	  OGC	  Web	  
Portal	  (such	  things	  as	  calendar	  events,	  participation	  lists,	  tasks	  or	  actions)	  

 OGC	  Change	  Requests	  
 Issue	  Trackers

 Compliant	  Products	  
 Product	  Implementations	  
 Press	  Releases,	  White	  Papers,	  Request	  for	  Comment	  documents	  

Not all of the above items should or will be brought into the RAP Advisor. However, the 
more linkages we can make between each of these data stores, the better we can propose 
solutions for the RAP Advisor users: ORM, Search, DWGs. 

8.3.5 Continuing Developments 

In using the development process with multiple sprints and a scripting environment such 
as PHP, continual and real-time edits, bug-fixes, or enhancements can be deployed as 
simply as saving a file (or checking out a new version of a file via Subversion) and 
refreshing a web browser – no builds, server reload or package deployment is required.  
This was quite useful during the face-to-face usability testing discussed below.  If an 
individual found an issue that we deemed to need correction (whether it was a bug, a 
spelling mistake, or some increased functionality), we were able to make changes 
immediately and allow the next tester to complete their testing with the new changes 
enabled.  Therefore, some of the comments were addressed in real-time and future 
comments would not include any reference to them, as the later tester would not have 
found the RAP Advisor exactly the same.

9 Usability testing  

9.1 Test Materials and the Testing Process 

To evaluate the Advisor prototype, OGC conducted a nearly month-long, usability test 
cycle.  OGC contracted with The Scientific Consulting Group (SCG) to support the 
usability test process.  This section including the usability testing results was written 
mostly by SCG. 
 
As background for the usability testing, four reference materials were developed: 

 RAP Advisor Flyer (Annex A); 
 RAP Advisor Guided Exercise (Annex B);   
 RAP Advisor Questionnaire (Annex C); 
 RAP Advisor Summary Report  (Annex D).   

 
The flyer offers users an overview of the tool including a screen shot of the Discovery 
Page, a description of the iterative process for OGC Standards selection, and a workflow 
diagram that illustrates how a customized summary report can be generated.   
 
Using “Web Mapping” as a potential system application, the RAP Advisor Guided 
Exercise describes how users can employ three discovery methods – “ORM Menu 
Browser,” “ORM Keyword Search,” and “OGC Domain Work Groups (DWG)” – to find 
and select relevant OGC Standards for this application. A list of the relevant OGC 
standards selected through each discovery method can be saved (in a profile folder) or 
revised as needed.  
 
After a satisfactory Profile Folder is developed, users can create a Summary Report that 
reviews their transaction history, lists the selected OGC Standards, provides a standards 
implementation scorecard, and normative and other references.  The RAP Advisor 
HTML Summary Report can be discarded or saved electronically and a Microsoft Word 
file can be exported.   
 
The questionnaire is available to record users’ comments about the RAP Advisor. The 
questionnaire contains 25 questions that are both subjective (e.g., how did it work?) and 
objective (e.g., how would you rate it?) divided across four categories – user information, 
testing summary, operational topics, and overall performance.    
 
The RAP Advisor usability test takes about 30 minutes to complete:  

 5 minutes to watch a video or receive an introduction to the tool;  
 15 minutes to conduct individual discovery and evaluations; and  
 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.

During the period from November 28 – December 18, 2012, a total of 11 users tested the 
RAP Advisor prototype.  The overall test period consisted of three phases:  

(1)  Face-to-face testing conducted November 28, 2012, U.S. Geological Survey 
(USGS) Facility, Reston, VA;  

(2) By-request, WebEx testing, (1 session conducted on November 30, 2012); and  
(3) Self-testing conducted December 5th − December 18th. 

 
The Face-to-face testing was conducted by appointment during a 2-3 hour test period at 
the USGS Facility.  Ten users from various DoD agencies and organizations scheduled 
and conducted 30-minute tests with OGC staff assistance during this period.  An OGC 
support contractor interviewed most participants about their RAP Advisor test and 
evaluation, and assisted them in completing their questionnaires.  
 
After testing the RAP Advisor, users were provided copies of the background materials 
and the URL (http://rap.opengeospatial.org) to encourage them to revisit the tool and 
further evaluate its capabilities. Following their face-to-face sessions, testers also were 
asked to follow up (by phone or e-mail) with OGC staff directly with any questions or 
suggestions for improvement.    
 
Like the face-to-face testing, the WebEx testing provided participants an opportunity to 
conduct the usability testing with direct support from OGC staff.  In addition, any WebEx 
tester had the opportunity to view an online version of the RAP Advisor Guided Exercise 
and complete an online version of the questionnaire.   
 
Similar to the WebEx testing, all of the Advisor reference materials were available online 
for the self-testing phase of the RAP Advisor usability testing. 
 
Table 1 lists the organizational affiliations of the users who participated in the usability 
testing.

Given the overall homogeneous nature of the Advisor testers, the profiles of individual 
users were very similar.  About 90 percent of the testers selected the Defense and 
Intelligence (D&I) Domain as their primary interest, had extensive experience with OGC 
Standards, and had previously developed a reference profile.  Most testers were 
engineers/developers (60%), and were evenly split (about 50%) between experienced and 
casual users based on their geospatial data and systems experience.  
 
Likewise, there was a lot of similarity among the search interests of the testers across the 
ORM browser menu, ORM keyword search, and DWGs.  Testers were most interested in: 
CDR, National Mapping, Web Mapping Service, Web Security Services, and Service 
Architecture and Implementation. Nearly all users created and saved their RAP Advisor 
Summary Reports.  
 

9.2 Test Results and Recommendations 

9.2.1 Overview of results 

In general, the conceptual design and operational approach in developing the RAP 
Advisor prototype was validated in the usability testing.  Users described the prototype as 
a “glorious tool,” “highly beneficial for systems development use,” and “user friendly.” 
During the face-to-face testing sessions, users had an opportunity to interact directly with 
OGC staff, and offer immediate suggestions for improvement. Some of the real-time 

                                                

5 As of December 26, 2012, no self-testing was conducted on the RAP Advisor, so it was decided that the self-test 
period would be extended until the OGC TC Meeting, January 14-18, 2013.  As additional self-test data is collected, 
the overall usability test results will be revised accordingly.

Users offered both subjective comments and objective ratings about the prototype and 
these results and recommendations are organized across three areas: Design Concepts, 
Functional Errors, and General Improvements.  

9.2.2 Design Concepts 

Generally, testers gave the RAP Advisor high marks in its conceptual design and 
operational approach. Testers were asked to rate the Advisor on a scale from 1 = poor; 2 
= fair; 3 = good; 4 = very good; and 5 = excellent. Table 2 summarizes their ratings for 
the portal tool and the HTML Report generated as a result of the OGC standard 
selections.

DWG selection 3.1   

 
In general, RAP Advisor testers rated the ability of the Advisor to “find relevant OGC 
Standards” high (e.g., 4.1). This score reflected the importance and high value testers had 
for the prototype capability, even though their scores for the individual Advisor discovery 
methods were lower.   
 
The highest scored Advisor discovery method was the ORM Menu Browser (e.g., 3.5). 
Users liked the browser because “selection options were clear” and the “the OGC 
Standards were understandable.”  There were some questions, however, about how useful 
the ORM Menu Browser may be to non-OGC users, and if there is sufficient information 
about the capabilities available if relevant OGC Standards are used in a specific system 
application.     
 
Other questions raised by the testers about the Advisor included: 

 Will external policy directives (e.g., GWG or CDR requirements) be included if 
an agency wants to use an OGC Standard in a development project? 

 Will procurement language be included that reflects requirements for OGC 
standards? 

 Will users have the option to conduct discovery sessions with multiple 
objectives? 

 Will users have the option to post discovery results for others to view?  
 Will users have the opportunity to conduct interrupted sessions, store a profile 

folder and return later for future exploration?  
 Will users have the opportunity to develop a “preferences” profile to allow them 

to customize their discovery options? 



OGC 12-156

 Will approved and under development (e.g., REST, Provenance) OGC Standards 
be included? 

 Will information about the OGC Network implementation be included?  
 DISR vs. RAP Advisor.  The DoD IT Standards Registry (DISR) is a single, 

unifying DoD registry for approved information technology (IT) and national 
security systems (NSS) standards and standards profiles.  A user suggested that 
the questionnaire used in the DISR for creating a standards “TV-1” profile would 
be a good thing to compare with the RAP Advisor. 

9.2.3 Functional Errors 

ORM Text Search 
 
Users assigned comparable ratings to the ORM Keyword and OGC DWG search 
methods.  Testers rated the Keyword Search method as “good” because of the RAP 
Advisor’s limitation to only ORM terms. Many testers found no results or “false positive” 
results and recommended that the keyword lexicon be greatly expanded. Some of the 
erroneous keyword search results included: 
 

 “Service Architecture” – several ORM clauses appear unrelated to the search term 
and there were more results with this term than when using “ORM Service 
Architecture; 

 “Results for ORM Clause Selections” – four OGC Standards were displayed yet 
only two OGC Standards should have appeared;     

 “Human Geography” – no results were obtained; 
 

It was suggested that installing a semantic search engine to support the keyword search 
method, as originally proposed in the RAP Advisor conceptual design, may offer a 
solution to the free text search limitations. Rather than relying exclusively on preset 
ORM keywords, a semantic engine would be able to match the search queries to a user’s 
context and return results within that context.  In other words, a semantic engine can 
learn and expand the keyword vocabulary based on user queries and through association 
build a more responsive system.  
 
Another tester suggested that the RAP Advisor Keyword Search function could be 
improved by developing an “Advanced Search” capability.  Using an advanced search 
engine with the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT, could broaden or narrow a 
search by combining words or phrases.  Alternatively, automatically populating the 
Keyword Search entries with the initial project description and other data that a user 
identified as their topic(s) of interest also could assist in text searching.   
 
Testers also questioned how acronyms and OGC standards under development are 
handled in Advisor text searches.  For example, OGC recently sought public comment on 
the candidate OGC GeoServices “REST” applications programming interface (API) 
standard.  The REST API provides a standard way for Web clients to communicate with 
geospatial technologies based on Representational State Transfer (REST) principles, yet 



OGC 12-156 

32 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

there is no connection between these terms (e.g., REST and Representational) in the 
Advisor.  
 
A fuller description of why OGC standards under development are not included in the 
RAP Advisor is provided below.  
 
OGC Domain Work Groups 
 
One of the most controversial issues about the RAP Advisor design was the use of DWGs 
in identifying and applying OGC standards. Some users said that “Domain” is a 
presumptive term because it is not relevant to non-OGC members, and it might be useful 
to substitute an alternative term such as OGC “functions.”  Others suggested that the 
initial list of 31 Domains provided in the Advisor was not sufficiently descriptive and 
DWG definitions were needed.  Still others recommended that “keywords” associated 
with each DWG are needed to better acquaint users with the Domains and potentially 
expand their membership to new users.   
 
If Domains continue to be one of the RAP Advisor discovery methods, a more complete 
list of DWGs is needed, but testers suggested a more understandable organization of 
Domains is needed to better classify them for review. For example, one tester asked about 
the number of Domains for the Web Mapping Server (WMS). He suggested that users 
may want to “drill down” on the Domains but the existing terms are not sufficiently 
descriptive.  
 
Concerning the list of Domains in the RAP Advisor, another user suggested that a “list 
all” and “de-select” option is needed to allow users to customize their discovery 
strategies.  
 

9.2.4 General Improvements 

As described earlier, testers generally agreed with (and saw the value in) the overall 
Advisor conceptual design, which is to develop a Web-enabled ORM with a graphical 
user interface to build useful OGC standard profiles to meet various system application 
needs. To indicate their support for Advisor development, users offered a variety of 
suggestions about how to improve the prototype.    
 
Standards under development 
 
One tester suggested that the OGC Web Service Common (OWS) Implementation 
standard should be included in the Advisor.  It is currently not in the ORM as the OWS 
Common was approved after the most recent version of the ORM was developed.  The 
ORM describes only those documents approved by the OGC members to be in the OGC 
standards baseline, e.g., standards and best practices.   
 



OGC 12-156 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 33 
 

The ORM and therefore the current version of the RAP Advisor do not contain 
Engineering Reports, Discussion Papers or any developments currently in work by an 
OGC Standards Working Group.  Another example was a tester looking for OGC work 
on REST that is in process but has not yet been approved.  This exclusive focus on 
approved standards was confusing and somewhat misleading to the testers and should be 
reconsidered in future versions of the Advisor. 
 
External Standards  
 
Several testers suggested that external standards and specifications such as CDR should 
be available in the Advisor.  One tester suggested that the CDR Integrated Product Team 
(IPT) specifications should be available for comparison to OGC standards. It was argued, 
however, that the Advisor was designed for use by DoD users to determine which OGC 
standards will apply to their system applications. If external standards such as CDR are 
not available on the Advisor, and may only be linked as normative references within 
OGC standards, a statement regarding this issue should be provided in the Advisor.  
 
Advisor Home Page and Screens 
 
There were numerous typographical and grammatical errors on the RAP Advisor Home 
Page and the following screens, and it was suggested that a spell check be conducted and 
possibly professional editing of the Advisor pages be employed.  It also was suggested 
that font colors and styles be properly selected to ensure that users can distinguish 
“hyper-type” links from other emphasized text in the screens. Further, it was suggested 
that the amount of text within each box be reviewed to minimize the number of words; 
also more bullets should be used to call attention to the steps that users must take to 
execute an action.    
 
Furthermore, it was suggested that a text change on the Home page be made from 
“Program Details” to “Program Scope.”   
 
Binoculars Icon 
 
There was no “Back ←” or “Forward →” icons on the Advisor screens, and testers were 
unfamiliar with the need to use the binoculars icon to revise their discover strategies. 
Because of the common use of back and forward arrows in Web searching, several testers 
suggested that arrows not binoculars be used to return or advance to relevant pages. 
Alternatively, one tester suggested using the “house” icon as a means of returning to the 
home page or initial discovery screen.  
 
Trash Icon 
 
Numerous testers unknowingly deleted their folder profiles because there was no warning 
on the trash icon that these entries would be deleted if this icon was selected.  A two-step 
confirmation process is needed in the trash icon to warn users about this function before 
it is executed.   



OGC 12-156 

34 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 
Discovery Method Labels  
 
Several testers suggested that each of the RAP Advisor discovery methods needs to be 
clearly labeled and defined to ensure that all users understand the differences among the 
various search methods.  It was suggested that the methods be labeled and defined as 
“ORM Browser Menu,” “ORM Keyword Search,” and “OGC Domain Work Group(s).”  
 
Web Browser Selection 
 
It may be necessary to offer specific Web Browser recommendations (e.g., Internet 
Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) for satisfactory RAP Advisor use. One user 
found that the Guided Exercise video box initially appeared on the Advisor Discovery 
page but disappeared when he moved to the Discovery page. This problem occurred 
when using Internet Explorer but was corrected when the tester reopened the Advisor 
with the Chrome browser.     
 
A similar problem occurred when a tester added GeoXACML standards to his folder, but 
in the profile folder the links to GeoXACML standards were not functional. By clicking 
on the title of the standard the tester was unable to connect to the standard using either 
the Internet Explorer or Chrome browsers.   
 
HTML Summary Report 
 
Nearly all testers created and found useful results in the RAP Advisor Summary Report. 
Everyone who created a report wanted both the Web and Word versions. Several users 
suggested ways to improve the Report. One formatting recommendation was to add a 
“Return to Top” icon after each standard to allow users to continually review their 
selections without continually scrolling the text.   
 
Another tester thought it would be helpful if the initial project description required to 
activate the Advisor could appear on the front page of the Summary Report as part of the 
transaction record of the Advisor discovery process.   
 

9.3 Conclusions 

Usability testers endorsed the RAP Advisor conceptual design and operational functions, 
and rated it “very good” in finding relevant OGC Standards.  In general, they agreed that 
the Advisor would be beneficial to them in their system development work. Specifically, 
testers endorsed the three discovery methods for querying, the use of a Profile Folder to 
review OGC Standards’ selections, and the creation of the RAP Advisor Summary 
Report to fully review their search results.  
 



OGC 12-156

As a prototype, the RAP Advisor does need some improvements and better descriptions 
about what is available in the data model. Testers raised a number of issues such as: the 
application of the RAP Advisor to CDR specifications, the availability of under 
development vs. accepted OGC standards, the incorporation of a semantic search engine 
in the ORM Keyword Search method, and the adaption of some more commonly used 
icons in RAP Advisor.    
 
Some of the findings and recommendations from the RAP Advisor usability testing are 
addressed in other sections of this Engineering Report.    
 

10 Application to Joint IC/DoD CDR 

10.1 Overview of CDR 

To test the RAP Advisor it was applied to the Joint IC/DoD Content Discovery and 
Retrieval (CDR).  CDR was established to enable content discovery and retrieval from all 
IC and DoD data collections.  

The CDR Reference Architecture (RA) is the keystone artifact for the overall set of 
guidance artifacts.  The CDR RA defines two primary capabilities -- content discovery 
and content retrieval.  Six core CDR components: Search, Brokered Search, Retrieve, 
Describe, Deliver, and Query Management provide these capabilities (Figure 11). The 
core components depend on externally defined Messaging and Security components, 
which are described in more detail in the CDR Specification Framework and CDR 
Specification documents.  The CDR RA will iteratively evolve and mature in increments 
to maintain a clear scope and facilitate timely and actionable guidance. 

The Scope of CDR is defined in the CDR RA as: 

Achieving a ubiquitous content discovery and retrieval solution presents a 
substantial challenge in the IC/DoD Enterprise where content exists in a large 
variety of structures, are represented in diverse semantics, and are exposed 
through many types of technical implementations.  To meet this challenge, the 
CDR RA describes an architecturally driven approach for guiding the IC/DoD 
Enterprise towards enabling content discovery and retrieval. 

Content, in the scope of this architecture, refers to the information made available 
for discovery and retrieval. A Content Resource refers to a particular instance of 
Content that can be discovered or retrieved as a unit. A Content Collection is a 
component that makes a set of Content Resources available under an instance of 
the component.  By addressing Content, the CDR RA thus addresses both Content 
Resources and Content Collections.

10.2 CDR concepts for RAP  

To run the advisor on CDR concepts a list of terms were selected from the CDR RA 
introduction and scope (listed in 10.1).  These terms (along with slight variations as listed 
in parentheses) were used as the basis for discovery in the RAP Advisor: 

 Discovery	  	  
 Retrieval	  	  
 Search	  
 Brokered	  Search	  (Broker)

10.3 RAP Results for CDR 

This report is a dynamic summary of OGC resources identified by the Reference 
Architecture Profile (RAP) Advisor from publicly available content mostly available on 
OGC Websites or resources maintained by OGC Staff or members.  The Profiler has 
helped you browser, search and question the OGC Reference Architecture document to 
help you narrow down the standards and supporting documents required (and or 
recommended) to implement your proposed system.   

During your research you selected the following standards:  

 OpenGIS Catalogue Service Implementation Specification [Catalogue Service for 
the Web] (CAT CSW) 

 CSW-ebRIM Registry Service - Part 1: ebRIM profile of CSW (CAT2 ebRIM 
part1) 

 OpenGIS Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard (GML) 
 Topic 11 - Metadata (Topic 11) 
 Topic 12 - The OpenGIS Service Architecture (Topic 12) 
 OpenGIS Web Feature Service 2.0 Interface Standard (also ISO 19142) (WFS) 
 OGC WCS 2.0 Interface Standard- Core:  Corrigendum  (WCS 2.0 Corrigendum) 
 GIGAS Methodology for comparative analysis of information and data 

management systems (GIGAS) 
 OWS-6 Security Engineering Report (OWS6SecurityER) 
 Authentication IE Engineering Report  (AuthIE) 
 Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture (Portal Architecture) 
 OWS Integrated Client (GeoDSS Client) (GeoDSS Client) 
 OGC Web Services Architectural Profile for the NSG (OWS Arch for NSG)

framework for developing and constructing your system.  

10.4 Discussion 

The testing listed earlier in this section was performed by OGC staff.  It is interesting to 
contrast this with the testing of CDR experts.  Members of the CDR Integrated Project 
Team (IPT) participated in the Usability Testing.   

Comments by several CDR experts during Usability Testing: 
 Looking	  for	  more	  crosswalks	  of	  OGC	  and	  CDR	  reference	  architectures.	  	  One	  

way	  is	  to	  include	  CDR	  specs	  into	  a	  version	  of	  this	  tool.	  
 Include	  external	  policy	  directives?	  EX:	  GWG	  requirements,	  an	  agency	  

requires	  OGC	  Standards	  for	  development	  projects.	  	  	  
 Show	  examples	  of	  procurement	  language	  that	  include	  requirements	  for	  OGC	  

Standards?	  	  
 Reference	  other	  Standards	  Developing	  Organizations	  standards?	  	  
 Can	  multiple	  objectives/sessions	  be	  included?	  Can	  interrupted	  sessions	  be	  

conducted?	  Can	  folders	  be	  stored	  and	  returned	  to	  in	  the	  future?	  	  
 GWG	  DISR	  has	  questionnaire	  tool	  for	  creating	  TV-­‐1	  profile.	  	  DISR	  vs.	  RAP	  

Advisor	  
 Did	  not	  find	  OpenSearch	  and	  OGC	  contributions	  to	  geospatial	  extensions	  to	  

OpenSearch	  	  
 Note	  that	  standards	  are	  not	  "connected"	  to	  implementation.	  	  
 Likes	  implementation	  scorecards.	  	  
 Discovered	  WFS,	  WMS,	  WMTS,	  WCS,	  GEOXCML	  
 Content	  of	  several	  domains	  was	  empty.	  
 Should	  consider	  an	  evaluation	  method	  beyond	  ORM	  text.	  	  Make	  use	  of	  

graphic	  display	  of	  web.	  	  	  
 
Some general conclusions are clear from these comments, e.g., continual refinement of 
the RAP Advisor is needed (and some has been done since the Usability Testing): 

 To	  increase	  the	  content	  that	  is	  discovered	  
 Continue	  to	  improve	  the	  reporting	  so	  that	  discovered	  standards	  are	  seen	  as	  

relevant	  to	  users	  that	  come	  from	  outside	  of	  OGC

11 Future work     

The version of the RAP Advisor developed concurrent with OWS-9 Testbed successfully 
demonstrated key conceptual design and operational functions with an overall usability 
test rating of “very good” in finding relevant OGC Standards.  In general, users agreed 
that the Advisor would be beneficial to them in their system development work.  

Nevertheless, the version of OWS-9 is a prototype with further developments needed 
both in functions and content.  Ideas for further development include: 

 Include	  OGC	  SWGs	  as	  well	  as	  adopted	  OGC	  standards	  
 Greater	  inclusion	  of	  OGC	  Engineering	  Reports	  and	  other	  non-­‐baseline	  

documents	  
 Show	  examples	  of	  procurement	  language	  that	  include	  requirements	  for	  OGC	  

Standards	  
 Consider	  including	  external	  policy	  directives	  that	  an	  agency	  requires	  for	  

development	  projects,	  e.g.,	  GWG	  requirements.	  	  	  
 Consider	  adding	  external	  documents	  beyond	  normative	  references	  perhaps	  

through	  ORM	  Section	  5,	  “Implementations	  of	  OGC	  Standards”	  	  
 Users	  recommendations	  for	  external	  documents	  to	  be	  included	  beyond	  the	  

current	  user	  comment	  sections,	  e.g.,	  add	  a	  button	  to	  automate.	  
 Consider	  referencing	  standards	  from	  other	  Standards	  Developing	  

Organizations	  beyond	  just	  as	  normative	  references	  to	  OGC	  standards.	  
 Make	  greater	  use	  of	  graphic	  display	  of	  web,	  e.g.,	  Graphic	  display	  of	  

relationships	  between	  standards.	  
 Incorporation	  of	  a	  semantic	  mediation	  in	  the	  ORM	  text	  search	  method	  	  
 Continued	  development	  and	  refinement	  of	  the	  DWG	  Discovery	  method	  

including	  increased	  content	  for	  each	  DWG.	  
 Dynamically	  generating	  figures	  of	  Document	  Relationships	  	  
 Consider	  displaying	  crosswalk	  of	  OGC	  and	  external	  standards,	  e.g.,	  CDR	  

reference	  architectures.	  	  One	  way	  is	  to	  include	  external	  specs	  into	  a	  version	  
of	  the	  Advisor.	  

 Testing	  through	  further	  application	  of	  the	  RAP	  Advisor	  to	  specific	  
developments,	  e.g.,	  CDR

The RAP Advisor recommends OGC Standards and OGC Knowledge 
Management resources relevant to a system development;  
The Advisor is useful in defining a profile of OGC standards suited to a 
user’s community needs. 

 
Users interact with the RAP Advisor through a web interface to convey their 
understanding of the scope of the system development. To create a profile 
of the OGC Knowledge Base, the user iteratively discovers OGC resources 
using several methods : 1. Navigate, 2. Search, 3. Select. 

Reference Architecture Profile 

RAP Advisor™  

The OGC Knowledge Management Strategy 
broadens global adoption of OGC content 
through education, training and KM.  
 
OGC Knowledge Management including, the 
RAP Advisor, will grow over time based on 
user feedback. 

The RAP Advisor was developed in the 
OGC Web Services Testbed, Phase 9 
(OWS-9) with sponsorship from the NGA. 
 
In addition to meeting the sponsor’s 
needs, the RAP Advisor is part of the 
OGC Knowledge Management Strategy 

OGC has over 60 
standards and many 
more resources in its 
Knowledge Base  
on geospatial  
interoperability  
 
How can a system 
developer identify 
and choose the 
standards they 
need? 
The RAP Advisor!

 !

The RAP Advisor engages users in an iterative process for selection of OGC Standards. 
 

Discover resources from the OGC KM by one of three methods: 
1. Navigate the OGC Reference Model (ORM) 
2. Search on text provide by the user 
3. Select an OGC Domain 
Evaluate resources and select standards for the Profile Folder. 
When the user is satisfied with the contents of the folder, a Report is created. 
The RAP Report contains information for the user to evaluate the standards 

Example Discovery inputs: 
1. Navigate to the ORM section on “Web 

Mapping Services”  
2. Searching on “Web Mapping” 
3. Selecting “Defense and Intel” Domain 
 
Evaluation of the standards from each input 
results in a Profile of Standards 

RAP Advisor Report provides not just the 
Standards of interest, but other 
information for the user to evaluate the 
profile of standards. 
 
RAP Advisor Report includes: 
- Selected Standards 
- Implementation scorecard 
- Normative and other References 

RAP Advisor™  

RAP Advisor iterative workflow creates a custom report

Summary Report 
This report is a dynamic summary of OGC resources identified by the Reference 
Architecture Profile (RAP) Advisor from publicly available content mostly available on 
OGC Websites or resources maintained by OGC Staff or members.  The Profiler has 
helped you browser, search and question the OGC Reference Architecture document to 
help you narrow down the standards and supporting documents required (and or 
recommended) to implement your proposed system.   

During your research you selected the following standards:  

 OpenGIS Web Map Service (WMS) Implementation Specification (WMS) 
 OpenGIS Web Map Tile Service Implementation Standard (WMTS) 
 OpenGIS Web Feature Service (WFS) Implementation Specification (WFS) 

 

Further research into OGC and related standards should help provide you with a possible 
framework for developing and constructing your system.

1.2	  An	  Example:	  Web	  Map	  Service	  

OGC’s Web Map Service standard is an example of interoperability achieved through open 
standards. It is of particular importance since the “map” is a potent user interface tool for 
conveying spatial information in a compact, useful and meaningful form. The Web Map Service 
standard began as discussion in the OGC Standard Program that became the first OGC 
Interoperability Program initiative, the Web Mapping Testbed, in 1998. The WMS candidate 
interface standard that was developed in the WMS Testbed was adopted as an OpenGIS 
Implementation Specification in 2000 (WMS version 1.0). Since then, WMS has progressed in 
maturity with implementations numbering in the thousands. WMS is now also published as ISO 
19128. 

WMS provides a simple example of how topics are discussed in this reference model: 

 Section 2.3 Spatial Referencing describes coordinate reference systems (CRSs) used in 
WMS. CRSs are vital to geospatial interoperability; 

 Section 3.2 OGC Web Services describes several OGC geospatial web services, 
including WMS, as a coordinated service architecture implemented with common 
elements across services; 

 Section 4.4 Spatial Data Infrastructures describes the use of WMS and other OGC Web 
Services in a reusable pattern for deployment for worldwide SDIs. 

 Section 5.1 OGC Compliance Test Program describes the automated testing resources 
available for all approved OGC services; these resources allow implementers to 
determine compliance with the OGC standards. 

WMS has dramatically increased the use of on-line mapping. One issue of OGC User describes 
the use of the WMS standard in helping with disaster response to hurricane Katrina, soils data 
distribution in Europe, a statewide data center, and access via mobile phones. In another OGC 
User article, the number of WMS servers on the Internet is seen to rise each week as more 
organizations realize the power of using open standards. At the same time, the number of WMS 
clients – designed for use in a browser, or on the desktop or on a mobile device – is growing. 

3.3	  OWS	  Web	  Mapping	  Services	  

The OpenGIS Web Map Service (WMS) Implementation Specification, also published as ISO 
19128, provides three operations (GetCapabilities, GetMap, and GetFeatureInfo) in support of the 
creation and display of registered and superimposed map-like views of information that come 
simultaneously from multiple remote and heterogeneous sources. 

The OpenGIS Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) provides for serving spatially referenced data using 
tile images with predefined content, extent, and resolution. WMTS trades the flexibility of custom 
map rendering – as provided by WMS – for the scalability possible by serving a fixed set of tiles. 
The fixed set of tiles also enables the use of standard network mechanisms for scalability such as 
distributed cache systems. WMTS includes both resource (REST) and procedure oriented 
architectural styles (KVP and SOAP). 

The OGC has defined profiles of WMS: 



OGC 12-156 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 53 
 

WMS Profiles Document Type 
Styled Layer Descriptor Profile of WMS Standard 
Web Map Service - Application Profile for EO Products Best Practice 
DGIWG WMS 1.3 Profile  Best Practice 

The OpenGIS Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) Profile of WMS, explains how WMS can be 
extended to allow user-defined symbolization of feature and coverage data. This profile defines 
how the Symbology Encoding standard can be used with WMS. SLD is used in combination with 
SE Standard. SLD allows for user-defined layers and named or user-defined styling in WMS. If a 
WMS is to symbolize features using a user-defined symbolization, the source of the feature data 
must be identified. The features may be in a remote WFS or WCS, or from a specific default 
feature/coverage store. WMS servers using remote feature data are also called Feature Portrayal 
Services (FPS), while those using remote coverage data are Coverage Portrayal Services (CPS). 

The OpenGIS Symbology Encoding (SE) Implementation Standard specifies the format of a map-
styling language for producing georeferenced maps with user-defined styling. SE is an XML 
language for styling information used to portray Feature and Coverage data. SE may be used 
together with SLD. As SE is a grammar for styling map data independent of any service interface 
standard it can be used flexibly by a number of services that style georeferenced information or 
store styling information that can be used by other services. 

The OpenGIS Web Map Context Documents Implementation Standard defines how a specific 
grouping of one or more maps from one or more WMS servers can be described in a portable, 
platform-independent format for storage in a repository or for transmission between clients. A 
Context Document contains sufficient information for Client software to reproduce the map, and 
ancillary metadata used to annotate or describe the maps and their provenance for the benefit of 
human viewers. (Based on the success of the Web Map Context, an OGC Standards Working 
Group is currently developing an OGC OWS Context Document standard.) 

The OGC KML Standard defines an XML grammar used to encode and transport representations 
of geographic data for display in an earth browser. Put simply: KML encodes what to show in an 
earth browser, and how to show it. (See also Section 2.4)
