1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

Members of the OGC have defined several profiles of OGC standards that are tailored to 
address requirements of specific communities of interest. The Testbed-10 Cross 
Community Interoperability (CCI) thread has explored the potential for implementing an 
architecture based on a selection of OGC web service profiles defined by the Defence 
Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG), US National System for Geospatial 
Intelligence (NSG) and the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD). DGIWG is the multi-
national organisation with the goal of improving geospatial interoperability between 
defence organisations of member nations. NSG is the combination of technologies, 
policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities, people, data and communities needed to 
produce geospatial intelligence in an integrated, multi-intelligence, multi-domain 
environment. This Engineering Report aims to describe the work performed during 
OWS-10 to analyse and assess interoperability between DGIWG, NSG and UK MOD 
profiles of the Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) standards. The 
report also presents findings from the implementation of these profiles. The report 
identifies issues that may be cause for interoperability concerns with standard OGC 
services or between the referenced profiles. 

The following web service profiles are the subject of this report: 

 DGIWG Web Feature Service 2.0 Profile [3] 

 DGIWG Web Map Service 1.3 Profile (Draft) [4] 

 US NSG Web Map Service 1.3 Profile [2] 

 UK MOD Web Feature Service 1.1 Profile [5] 

 UK MOD Web Map Service 1.3 Profile [6] 

In order to achieve the aims of this engineering report, the following questions were 
addressed by the thread: 

 What are the similarities between interfaces (including operations and their 
parameters) offered by services based on the DGIWG, US NSG and UK MOD 
profiles of WMS? 

 What are the differences between interfaces (including operations and their 
parameters) offered by services based on the DGIWG, US NSG and UK MOD 
profiles of WMS?

 What are the similarities between interfaces (including operations and their 
parameters) offered by services based on the DGIWG and UK MOD profiles of 
WFS? 

 What are the differences between interfaces (including operations and their 
parameters) offered by services based on the DGIWG, and UK MOD profiles of 
WFS? 

 How would the differences between the profiles of the aforementioned services 
prevent interoperability?

5 Methodology 

To address the questions presented in the previous section, the CCI thread adopted the 
following methodology:

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

1. Review requirements of the different profiles 

2. Configure the web services to conform to the relevant profiles 

3. Identify similarities and differences between the profiles 

4. Collect feedback from subject matter experts and thread participants 

5. Evaluate and document findings 

5.1 Architecture 

The architecture adopted by the Profile Interoperability aspect of the CCI thread is 
illustrated in Figure 1. The architecture shows components from Pyxis Innovation, Inc. 
Envitia Ltd. and Interactive Instruments GmbH (ii). 

 

Figure 1. Testbed-10 CCI Profile Interoperability Architecture 

 

As illustrated the architecture included both WFS and WMS services based on a variety 
of profiles. The architecture also included different implementations of the same profile, 



14-021r2 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 7 
 

specifically WMS, which facilitated testing of the profile. It should be noted that 
although the UK MOD WFS profile is discussed in this engineering report, it is however 
intentionally omitted from the architecture as none of the components used in the testbed 
currently implement the profile. It is envisioned that profiles not implemented in the 
current testbed shall be explored in future testbeds, subject to sponsor requirements and 
available resources.

6 Comparison of WMS Profiles 

The following tables present the requirements of the WMS profiles against each operation offered by the service. Each row presents the 
requirements against the relevant operation and parameter in order to highlight the similarities and differences between the profiles. The phrase 
“Supported as specified in the OGC WMS 1.3 Standard” has been used to indicate that the profile does not make changes to the requirement 
specified in the base standard.

Service Abstract Includes a security classification 
identified at the top of the security 

field. 

DGIWG profile requires a conforming 
WMS server to include the following 

information in the abstract element of the 
service metadata: "This service implements 
the DGIWG WMS profile 1.3 version 1.0." 
Additional Clarification: "Use of security 

classification is allowable, but not 
mandatory in the DGIWG profile" 
Additional Clarification: “DGIWG 

determines, identification of source CRS and 
transformation within the GetCapabilities 

Abstract to be an inappropriate location for 
this information.” 

Requires inclusion of text 
identifying the source CRS 
and transformation used. 

Service Access 
Constraints 

Populate the wms:AccessConstraints 
element as you would the 
classification markings of a classified 
document. This defines the highest 
classification level of the content 
accessible through the WMS service. 
This may also include Fees. 

Supported as specified in the OGC WMS 1.3 
Standard, though likely to require support 
for multinational classification systems. 

Additional clarification: “For the use of the 
DGIWG profile in an NATO environment, 
the common NATO classification scheme 

has to be applied.” 

Supported as specified in the 
OGC WMS 1.3 Standard. 

Service LayerLimit  Supported as specified in the OGC 
WMS 1.3 Standard. 

If a DGIWG WMS server implements the 
LayerLimit parameter, it shall not be less 

than 20. 

General 



14-021r2

Service MaxWidth 
and 
MaxHeight  

The MaxWidth and MaxHeight shall 
be greater or equal to 800 pixels. 

The MaxWidth and MaxHeight shall be 
greater or equal to 800 pixels. 

If omitted then 
MaxWidth and 

MaxHeight imply no limit 
on the parameters. If 
included MaxHeight 

and MaxWidth shall not be 
less than 800. 

Layer Abstract The Abstract element is not inherited 
by child Layers. 

Supported as specified in the OGC WMS 1.3 
Standard.  

The DGIWG profile however is not clear on 
this and thus it is recommended that the 
profile be updated clarify the inheritance 

requirements. 

Supported as specified in the 
OGC WMS 1.3 Standard. 

Style General If only a single style is available, that 
style is known as the “default” style 

and need not be advertised by the 
server. Style declarations are 

inherited by child Layers. A child 
shall not redefine a Style with the 

same Name as one inherited from a 
parent. A child may define a new 
Style with a new Name that is not 

available for the parent Layer. 

DGIWG profile states that “A DGIWG 
WMS server shall always provide at least 

one style element even if only a default style 
is advertised.” 

This profile mandates that a 
Named Layer must have at 

least one Style element. 

Style Format Supported as specified in the OGC 
WMS 1.3 Standard. 

DGIWG profile allows PNG, GIF or JPEG 
as a minimum. 

Supported as specified in the 
OGC WMS 1.3 Standard.

EX_Geogra
phicBoundi

ngBox 

General Every named Layer shall have 
exactly one 

EX_GeographicBoundingBox 
element that is either stated explicitly 

or inherited from a parent Layer. 

DGIWG profile is not clear on whether it 
requires the CRS of the 

EX_GeographicBoundingBox to be stated 
explicitly or inherited from a parent layer. 

Additional clarification: “The DGIWG 
WMS profile states no further requirement 

as already defined in the base standard. 
Recommendation to update DGIWG profile 

to clarify this aspect.” 

UKMOD profile mandates 
that every Layer whether 
Named or Category must 

have an explicit CRS for the 
layer.

CRS The NSG provides the following 
profiling instruction "To be 

consistent with the DGIWG WMS 
1.3 Profile, CRS elements shall be 
stated explicitly and not inherited 

from a parent layer. The service shall 
support the following Coordinate 
Reference Systems, and use the 

following associated keywords 1) to 
designate them in its responses, and 

2) to process the clients’ requests 
[WGS84 geographic longitude, then 

atitude, expressed in decimal 
degrees:CRS:84], [WGS84 

geographic latitude, then longitude, 
expressed in decimal 

degrees:EPSG:4326] and [World 
Mercator projection:EPSG:3395]. 

The NSG also provides the following 
profiling instruction "Among the 
following Coordinate Reference 

Systems, the service shall support all 
those which validity zone overlaps 
data published by the service. For 

each of these Coordinate Reference 
Systems, the following associated 

keywords shall be used 1) to 
designate them in its responses, and 
2) to process the clients’ requests" 
[UTM projections over WGS84 
(north zones): EPSG:32601 to 

EPSG:32660], [UTM projections 
over WGS84 (south zones): 

EPSG:32701 to EPSG:32760], [UPS 
projection over WGS84 (north zone): 

  j i   
    

At a minimum, DGIWG profile requires 
support of EPSG:4326, EPSG:3395 and 

CRS:84 

In a Named Layer it is 
appropriate Worldwide CRS 
are used in accordance with 
the previous DGIWG WMS 
profile [7] and UTM/UPS 
projections which the layer 

data covers. 
In addition to this it is 

recommended that for local 
operations (such as UK 

Operations which is 
illustrated by the 

EPSG:27700 in the 
example) such projections 
or datums should be added 

if the Named Layer data 
covers these CRS.  When 

adding CRS other than those 
based on WGS 1984 to a 

Named Layer correct use of 
Geodetic Datum 

Transformations must be 
applied as per OGC 

document 09-187 and 
recorded in the <Abstract> 

as described above.

overall security marking and “portion 
markings” at the layer level. It 

follows the conventions for 
document marking so it will be 
intuitive to the user community. 
See AccessConstraints above." 

The DGIWG WMS profile states no further 
requirement as already defined in the base 
standard. Recommendation to update 
DGIWG profile to clarify this aspect. 
It is foreseeable that DGIWG WMS will 
reference metadata documents based on the 
DGIWG metadata specification.

FeatureList
URL  

General A server may use 
a FeatureListURL element to point to 
a list of the features represented in a 

Layer. FeatureListURL is not 
inherited by child layers. 

DGIWG requires that If the 
GetCapabilities document identifies support 
for FeatureListURL then the list of features 

that are in the particular layer shall be 
resolvable through the provided URL. 

Additional clarification: “DGIWG might 
want to define either a structure for the 
FeatureListURL or at least provide an 

example” 

Supported as specified in the 
OGC WMS 1.3 Standard. 

DataURL  General A server may use DataURL to offer a 
link to the underlying data 

represented by a particular layer. 

DGIWG requires that If the 
GetCapabilities document identifies support 
for DataURL then the underlying data of the 
particular layer shall be resolvable through 

the provided URL. 

Supported as specified in the 
OGC WMS 1.3 Standard. 

Layer General A Layer may have zero or more of 
the following XML attributes: 
queryable, cascaded, opaque, 

noSubsets, fixedWidth, fixedHeight. 
All of these attributes are optional 

and default to 0. Each of these 
attributes can be inherited or replaced 

by subsidiary layers 

DGIWG profile requires that a DGIWG 
WMS server shall provide the XML 

Attributes: queryable, cascaded, Opaque, 
noSubsets, fixedWidth and fixedHeight. 

Queryable attribute must be 
provided however, a Layer 
may have zero or more of 

the following XML

Layer noSubsets Allows both subsettable and non-
subsettable layers. When set to a true 

value, noSubsets indicates that the 
server is not able to make a map of a 
geographic area other than the layer's 

bounding box.  

The DGIWG Web Map Service (WMS) 1.3 
Profile: All layers published by the service 
shall be subsettable and resizable - enables 
the client to benefit from service-oriented 

data dissemination. 

All layers published by the 
service shall be subsettable, 
resizable and not defined as 

opaque. 

Format General Every server shall support the default 
text/xml format defined in Annex A. 
Support for other formats is optional. 

If the request specifies a format not 
supported by the server, the server 

shall respond with the default 
text/xml format. 

DGIWG Requirement 3 states that "A 
DGIWG WMS server shall support text/xml 

and text/html as output formats for the 
GetCapabilities and the GetFeatureInfo 

Operations" 

The default format for the 
response to a 

GetCapabilities must be 
“text/xml”. Other formats 
may be present, but must 

include as a minimum 
“text/xml”.

8 Discussion 

The various profiles were successfully implemented in the testbed and a number of 
observations made. This section presents those observations. A screenshot showing an 
overlay of topographic and maritime data from some of the services discussed in this 
report is presented in Figure 2.  The screenshot highlights a key benefit of profile 
interoperability and that is that it is possible to bring together data from disparate sources 
across a community.

from the UK MOD WMS 

 

8.1 WMS 

The DGIWG WMS profile was implemented using two different products in the testbed, 
namely Envitia MapLink and Interactive Instruments GmbH XtraServer. The former was 
also configured to conform to the UK MOD WMS profile, whereas the latter was also 
configured to conform to the NSG WMS Profile. Configuration of the products to the 
referenced profiles was overall successful, and it was observed that both the UK MOD 
profile and the NSG WMS profile are generally consistent with the DGIWG WMS 
profile. There are, however, some issues worth noting. 

Both the DGIWG and NSG WMS profiles require that “a server shall use one or more 
<MetadataURL> elements to offer detailed, standardized metadata about the data 
corresponding to a particular layer”. It was observed during implementation of the 
profiles that if metadata for the layers was not available, it reduced conformance of the 



14-021r2 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 27 
 

implementation to the profile. As the unavailability of metadata is common, the 
requirement to always provide MetadataURL elements should therefore be considered 
across all of the referenced profiles and implementers encouraged to populate it. 

With regard to <MetadataURL> it is also worth noting that the NSG WMS profile 
requires the metadata to be based on NSG Metadata Implementation Specification 
(NMIS), whereas (although not specified) the DGIWG Metadata Foundation would be 
more appropriate for use with implementations of the DGIWG WMS profile. Similarly, 
the UK MOD Geospatial Metadata Profile (MGMP) would be more appropriate for use 
with implementations of the UK MOD WMS profile. 

The DGIWG profile lists a minimum set of CRS and alignment of the NSG profile to the 
DGIWG CRS requirement means that no significant issues are likely. The UK MOD 
profile recommends that “Named Layers support a Worldwide CRS” but does not 
mandate a specific CRS. To reduce the possibility of implementations selecting a 
Worldwide CRS that is not supported by the other referenced profiles, it is necessary for 
the UK MOD profile to require that at least one of the CRS required by the DGIWG 
profile be offered by services conforming to the UK MOD profile. One such appropriate 
CRS that could be used across all of the three referenced profiles would be the World 
Geodetic System 1984 (also referred to as WGS84 or EPSG:4326), which is arguably the 
most widely used Worldwide CRS – used in smartphones, surveying equipment, satellite 
navigation systems, search engines and other mass market applications. 

The testbed observed that the previous version of the DGIWG WMS profile forbade 
hierarchical layers on the grounds that most clients and servers did not support them [7]. 
However, the draft version of the profile (which is the reference DGIWG profile for this 
testbed) states that “the <Layer> element can enclose child elements providing metadata 
about the Layer. The values of some of these elements can be inherited by subsidiary 
layers” [4]. Both Envitia MapLink and XtraServer were configured to allow all data 
carrying layers to appear as direct children of the root layer. Testbed participants noted 
that allowing hierarchical layers is a useful part of the WMS standard and current client 
applications are typically able to cope with the capability. 

8.2 WFS 

The WFS 2.0 standard allows for the following types of Conformance classes: Simple 
WFS, Basic WFS, Transactional WFS and Locking WFS. All of these WFS 2.0 
conformance classes include operations that are not supported by WFS 1.1, which 
presents an obstacle to interoperability with WFS 1.1 implementations. One of the 
obstacles to interoperability is that a Basic WFS 2.0 allows for Joins in Query objects as 
part of Filter objects used by WFS 2.0. The Filter objects used by WFS 2.0 are specified 
in the Filter 2.0 standard. A Simple WFS however, only requires that the service offer at 
least “One stored query, that fetches a feature using its id, shall be available but the server 
may also offer additional stored queries”. 

According to the WFS 2.0 standard, a Simple WFS service can offer a StoredQuery that 
accepts parameters of any type. This implies that although a Basic WFS 2.0 requires 



14-021r2 

28 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Filter 2.0 objects, a Simple WFS 2.0 can offer a StoredQuery that receives Filter 1.1 
objects. To enable cross community interoperability, it may be necessary to change the 
WFS 2.0 standard to require a Simple WFS to offer an additional StoredQuery that 
accepts Filter 1.1 objects. This would make WFS 2.0 more “backward compatible” than it 
currently is. Alternatively, and possibly more efficiently, it may be left up to future WFS 
2.0 profiles to require implementation of such StoredQueries. 

In exploring the DGIWG WFS 2.0 profile, an instance of the XtraServer product by 
Interactive Instruments GmbH was successfully configured according to the profile. All 
of the requirements specified in the profile were found to be understandable and sound. 
The requirements and most recommendations could be easily configured, changes in the 
software were not necessary. The only exceptions were support for response paging and 
joins. A number of issues concerning the clarity of the requirements were found in 
Requirement 21 of the profile, which specifies constraints to apply on specific operations. 
The issues, which are listed next, seem to suggest that the profile is a work-in-progress: 

1. Constraint name "CountDefault" is mandatory (M), though the Description allows 
for leaving it out. 

2. There is no obligation (e.g. mandatory or optional) value for "SortLevelLimit". 

3. Constraint name "ResolveLocalScope" is mandatory (M), though the Description 
allows for leaving it out. 

4. The DGIWG values constraint column specifies "To be discussed!" for the 
"QueryExpression" constraint 

Since the DGIWG tests are based on the conformance classes defined in the WFS 
standard of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO 19142), an attempt 
has been made to run the configured service against the Compliance and Interoperability 
Testing Initiative (CITE) Test Suite provided by OGC. This was not successful due to 
errors in the CITE tests. The observed issues have been reported to the CITE 
administrators. 

The role of StoredQuery functionality was also explored in relation to data conflation, 
using the NSG Topographic Data Store (TDS). The DGIWG WFS was configured to 
offer a set of TDS feature types through a Stored Query that could be invoked with only 
two parameters, namely the identifier of the StoredQuery and the area of interest. Such 
queries are particularly useful for disseminating complete or subsets of datasets made up 
of multiple feature types. This aspect of the work however, highlighted that the naming of 
StoredQuery functions seems to be an issue, for which profiles other than the core WFS 
2.0 standard may be needed to help. The schema, as specified by the standard, requires 
that the name is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Therefore, since DGIWG owns a 
top level URI Namespace, DGIWG would be in a position to define a URI schema for 
DGIWG related URI-based StoredQuery names. This suggests that the other 



14-021r2 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 29 
 

organisations e.g. US NGA and UK MOD would also need to provide similar URI 
schemes to support identification of StoredQuery functions. 

9 Conclusions 

This report has presented a comparative analysis of NSG, DGIWG and UK MOD profiles 
of WMS and WFS. The analysis considered operations offered by each service and the 
parameters accepted or capabilities offered. The report has also presented observations 
from the implementation of the profiles within the Testbed-10 testbed.  The discussion 
has also been informed by feedback from the DGIWG community. 

This report concludes that there is significant interoperability between the NSG, DGIWG 
and UK MOD profiles of WMS. The high degree of interoperability is due to the three 
profiles being based on the same versions of WMS and supporting common capabilities 
such as worldwide CRS, image formats and data encodings. Unsurprisingly there are 
some capabilities that are specific to each profile, for example, the mandatory support of 
specific CRS by the DGIWG profile. However, the observed common capabilities imply 
that the profiles are primarily interoperable.  

The report also concludes that interoperability between the DGIWG and UK MOD 
profiles of WFS could be improved significantly if both profiles were based on the same 
version of WFS. Given that the DGIWG profile of WFS is based on the latest version of 
the WFS standard, a key recommendation of this report is that a UK MOD profile for 
version 2.0 of the WFS standard be developed. The complete set of recommendations is 
presented in the following section. 

10 Recommendations 

The following recommendations have been identified. 

10.1 Offer an Optional StoredQuery in WFS 2.0 for Supporting Filter 1.1 Requests 

Currently the Filter 2.0 standard prevents WFS 2.0 from being backwards compatible 
with WFS 1.1. To help address this issue, Simple WFS based on WFS 2.0 could 
optionally implement a StoredQuery for receiving a Filter 1.1 Query and processing it as 
a WFS 1.1 would. 

10.2 Establish a StoredQuery Registry and URI scheme for profiles 

To facilitate the reuse of StoredQuery implementations across communities, a mechanism 
for unique identification and registration should be established. The WFS schema, as 
specified by the standard, requires that the name of a StoredQuery is a URI. Since 
DGIWG owns a top level URN Namespace, DGIWG would be in a position to define a 
URI scheme for DGIWG related StoredQuery names.

10.3 Develop a UK MOD Profile for WFS 2.0 

There is limited backwards compatibility between WFS 1.1 and 2.0, therefore some of 
the factors affecting interoperability between the DGIWG WFS profile (based on WFS 
2.0) and the UK MOD WFS profile (based on WFS 1.1) may not be resolvable unless 
both profiles are grounded on the same version of WFS. Following the March 2014 
Technical Committee meeting, Dstl confirmed that the UK MOD are currently 
considering the adoption of the DGIWG WFS 2.0 profile. 

10.4 Offer an Optional WMS Capability for Styling GetFeatureInfo Responses 

Although the WMS standard allows for GetFeatureInfo to return responses in different 
encodings, it however relies on a client application or a separate web service to transform 
the responses (e.g. for different HTML styling). WMS could offer an optional capability 
that allows GetFeatureInfo requests to ingest complete or subsets of XSLT scripts to 
apply to GetFeatureInfo responses. This could be implemented in a similar way to how 
WMS can ingest SLDs. 

10.5 WMS GetFeatureInfo responses should be offered in at least XML format 

The DGIWG WMS profile requires services to support text/xml and text/html as output 
formats for the GetFeatureInfo Operation. The UK MOD requires services to support at 
least one of the following MIME types for the INFO-FORMAT Parameter text/xml, 
text/html and text/plain. This means that an implementation of the UK MOD profile 
could return text/plain responses and remain conformant to the UK MOD profile but not 
interoperable with the DGIWG profile. 

10.6 All WMS profiles should require provision of MetadataURL 

Currently not all of the referenced profiles mandate the use of MetadataURL elements. 
The provision of additional metadata through this element could help inform client 
applications of the suitability of resources offered by the service.
