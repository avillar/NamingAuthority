Introduction 

This document is the specification for a Geolinked Data Access Service (GDAS).   

This specification is intended to provide a very simple way to implement on-line access 
to the vast number of data collections that contain geographically related information, but 
which do not include a rigorous definition of the geometry of the geographic object. 
 
Geolinked data is geographically-related data in which the geometry is not directly stored 
with the attribute data, but instead a geographic identifier is used. The geographic 
identifier refers to a geometric feature in a separate geospatial data set. An example of 
geolinked data is a table of populations of Canadian cities. The table does not contain the 
geographic location of each city, but instead uses the city name. The city name can be 
used to join the population data to a separate geospatial data set that contains the 
geographic location of each city, in order to map the information or perform some sort of 
geospatial analysis. 
 
A GDAS provides a simple standardized way to exchange attribute information that 
applies to a well-known geospatial dataset (a Framework dataset).  A GDAS delivers 
information in an XML format that can be used in a variety of ways, including use by 
models to perform calculations, or visualized as a web map.  
 
The development of services based on this specification presupposes the existence of 
corporate databases that contain geographically referenced information, but where the 
corporate environment does not contain a direct link to a GIS.  The Geolinkage Field (the 
names of each of the cities in the above example) must exist in a compatible format in 
both the geolinked data set and the geospatial data set (e.g., the city name in both data 
sets must be identical), to provide the linkage between the two data sets. 
 
 

0.1 The requirement for GDAS 
Almost all corporate databases contain some kind of geographic identifier, regardless of 
whether or not the database is housed in a computing environment that supports GIS.  
Geographic identifiers can include postal codes, municipality names, telephone area 
codes, or more special purpose identifiers such as school districts.  Geolinking 
technology allows this corporate data to be found and used for mapping or spatial 
analysis. 

The geographic identifiers used in corporate databases usually reference a spatial 
framework.  A spatial framework in this context is a partitioning of the surface of the 
earth into a set of management units.   Municipalities, postal codes, telephone area codes, 
ecoregions, and watersheds are all examples of spatial frameworks.  These frameworks

all have one thing in common – they contain a descriptor that can be used to uniquely 
identify any individual management unit –and that same identifier is found in the 
corporate database. 

Here are some typical database contents along with their spatial frameworks: 

Sales by retail outlet or by municipality 
Insurance payments by postal code 
Telephone numbers by area code 
Farms by Census Agricultural Region 
Students by school district 

 

The GDAS specification is a way to expose this corporate data to other computers, so that 
it can be found and accessed, and a way to merge that data with the spatial data that 
describes the framework, in order to enable mapping or geospatial analysis. 

 
0.2 Advantages of GDAS 
The advantages of the GDAS specification is that it allows organizations to house their 
corporate data on systems that are optimized for the management of that data, and yet to 
take advantage of GIS technology to examine and analyze that data.  In addition, it is  

Simple to implement 
Lightweight 
Multi-purpose 
Highly scaleable 
Easy to use 
Usable across the Internet 

 

GDAS allows corporate data to be maintained closest to source, and yet allow the latest 
data to be obtained when analysis is being performed, regardless of whether or not the 
geospatial system can make a direct connection to the corporate data management 
system.  Exposing the data through a GDAS allows the corporate data managers to 
change their underlying database design and security safeguards without compromising 
access to data that should be accessible by other systems.  In effect, GDAS supports both 
distributed data management, as well as the distributed processing of geospatial data. 

Geolinking is based on two related specifications.  Attribute data is provided to other 
computers on the network by implementing a Geolinked Data Access Service (GDAS).  
At some other node on the network, a Geolinking Service allows a computer to use data 
from a GDAS stream by incorporating it into a local dataset.  This local dataset may

· 

support Web Mapping, desktop GIS, or even some analytical capability that may in turn 
produce another GDAS stream.   

 

 

0.3 Applications of GDAS 
 
0.3.1 GDAS and Web Mapping 
The most widely applicable use of GDAS may be to support Web mapping.  In this case, 
a Geolinking Service is placed on top of a Web Mapping Service (WMS), to create a 
Geolinking WMS.  Attributes provided through a GDAS stream are merged into a local 
dataset by the Geolinking Service, which  then allows a WMS layer to be produced.  The 
resulting dataset can be stored for future queries (and exposed as a standard layer by the 
WMS), or discarded after processing if data volatility is of concern. 
 
0.3.2 GDAS and Desktop GIS 
Similar to Web mapping, a spatial data warehouse that supports desktop GIS may have 
its attribute data supplemented or amended by data provided via a GDAS stream.  In this 
case, a Geolinking Service adds fields to a spatial dataset in the warehouse, or amends the 
contents of existing attribute fields.   
 
0.3.3 GDAS and Distributed Spatial Data Processing 
GDAS also allows for the ability to do more rudimentary calculations with the data.  For 
example, it is trivial to take two separate GDAS streams for the same framework data and 
calculate the differences between the two attributes, and provide that result in the form of 
another GDAS stream.  For example,  

Input GDAS stream 1:  student enrollment for 1996 
Input GDAS stream 2:  student enrollment for 2003 
Output GDAS stream:  difference in student enrollment between 1996 and 2003 

 
0.3.4 GDAS and Modelling 
When geospatial data is available on the Internet through a GDAS, it is easy to feed that 
data into models (e.g. climate change models).  A model can be enabled to accept data in 
GDAS format on the front end, and a GDAS to deliver the output of the model.  This 
setup makes it easy to run different input scenarios through the model, ultimately 
simplifying data management, and reducing the potential for errors in input data.  

0.3.5 GDAS and Spatial Data Replication 
GDAS also allows for the ability to replicate databases across the Internet.  A GDAS 
XML stream can be used to regularly update the contents of a data warehouse and its 
associated metadata tables, based on the latest information available from the primary 
data warehouse.

0.4 GDAS, WFS, and GML 
It may be argued that the existing WFS and GML specifications can be modified to 
support the functionality offered by GDAS, however there are a number of reasons why 
GDAS should be a separate specification: 

1) WFS and GML are primarily designed to address the editing and transmission of 
the geography that describe spatial features.  GDAS is targeted towards the 
transmission of attributes which describe spatial features, without transmitting the 
geography.  The types of databases that contain these two disparate concepts are 
quite separate, and geolinking is not likely to be needed when the two types of 
data are found together, so it makes sense to have separate custom schemas for 
each type of data, particularly since there are other factors to be considered. 

2) GML does not accommodate the concept of geospatial frameworks or geolinked 
datasets, and the metadata required to completely support these concepts.  
Although GML could certainly be extended to completely handle geolinked data 
requirements, it makes more sense to have a simpler lightweight XML schema 
that is customized to deal with geolinked data. 

3) There are several ways that geolinked attributes can be coded in GML.  
Standardizing this for ease of implementation would require a GML profile or a 
use case, which would then have to be adopted through some standards process.  
Given the potential importance of geolinked data as a source of information for 
Web-based GIS activities, a separate specification is warranted.  

4) The XML stream produced by a GDAS is much simpler, more intuitive, and 
easier to write, read, and debug than GML.  This easy of implementation is 
important because it will facilitate the acceptance of this technology among the IT 
community responsible for systems that contain geolinked data. 

5) It is easy to generate GDAS XML streams directly from corporate database 
management technology.  The use of WFS/GML typically requires installation of 
additional software, which may impede the adoption of GDAS in the corporate 
domain. 

The use of GDAS does not preclude the use of GML.  A Geolinking Service can be set 
up to merge a GDAS stream with a GML stream.  The output would be an amended 
GML stream that incorporates the attribute information that was provided by the GDAS.

OpenGIS© Interface — Geolinked Data Access Service 

1 Scope 

This specification applies to the creation and use of Geolinked Data Access Service 
(GDAS) documents which unambiguously describe a set of attributes that apply to a 
geospatial dataset (a “framework” dataset), and that might be used by particular clients 
for the purpose of mapping or data processing. 
 
This specification defines an encoding for GDAS using eXtensible Markup Language 
[XML 1.0]. 
 
This specification is relevant to Clients of the OGC Geolinking Service [currently an 
OGC discussion document].  
 
This specification does not address the archival, cataloging, discovery or retrieval of 
GDAS XML documents.

6  Basic service elements 

 
6.1 Introduction 
 
This clause specifies aspects of Geolinked Data Access Server behavior (more generally, 
of OGC Web Service behavior) that are independent of particular operations or are 
common to several operations or interfaces. 
 
6.2 Version numbering and negotiation 
 
6.2.1 Version number form 
 
The published specification version number contains three positive integers, separated by 
decimal points, in the form "x.y.z". The numbers "y" and "z" will never exceed 99. Each 
OWS specification is numbered independently. 
 
6.2.2 Version changes 
 
A particular specification's version number shall be changed with each revision. The 
number shall increase monotonically and shall comprise no more than three integers 
separated by decimal points, with the first integer being the most significant. There may 
be gaps in the numerical sequence. Some numbers may denote experimental or interim 
versions. Service instances and their clients need not support all defined versions, but 
must obey the negotiation rules below. 
 
6.2.3 Appearance in Requests and in Service Metadata 
 



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –©  All rights reserved 
15 

The version number appears in at least two places: in the Capabilities XML describing a 
service, and in the parameter list of client requests to that service. The version number 
used in a client's request of a particular service instance must be equal to a version 
number which that instance has declared it supports (except during negotiation as 
described below). A service instance may support several versions, whose values clients 
may discover according to the negotiation rules. 
 
 
6.2.4 Version number negotiation 
 
A Client may negotiate with a Service Instance to determine a mutually agreeable 
specification version. Negotiation is performed using the GetCapabilities operation [see 
Clause 7] according to the following rules. 
 
All Capabilities XML must include a protocol version number. In response to a 
GetCapabilities request containing a version number, an OGC Web Service must either 
respond with output that conforms to that version of the specification, or negotiate a 
mutually agreeable version if the requested version is not implemented on the server. If 
no version number is specified in the request, the server must respond with the highest 
version it understands and label the response accordingly. 
 
Version number negotiation occurs as follows: 
 
a) If the server implements the requested version number, the server must send that 
version. 
 
b) If a version unknown to the server is requested, the server must send the highest 
version it knows that is less than the requested version. 
 
c) If the client request is for a version lower than any of those known to the server, then 
the server must send the lowest version it knows. 
 
d) If the client does not understand the new version number sent by the server, it may 
either cease communicating with the server or send a new request with a new version 
number that the client does understand but which is less than that sent by the server (if 
the server had responded with a lower version). 
 
e) If the server had responded with a higher version (because the request was for a 
version lower than any known to the server), and the client does not understand the 
proposed higher version, then the client may send a new request with a version number 
higher than that sent by the server. 
 
The process is repeated until a mutually understood version is reached, or until the client 
determines that it will not or cannot communicate with that particular server. 
 



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –16 ©  All rights reserved
 

EXAMPLE 1 Server understands versions 1, 2, 4, 5 and 8. Client understands versions 1, 3, 4, 6, 
and 7. Client requests version 7. Server responds with version 5. Client requests version 4. Server 
responds with version 4, which the client understands, and the negotiation ends successfully. 
 
EXAMPLE 2 Server understands versions 4, 5 and 8. Client understands version 3. Client 
requests version 3. Server responds with version 4. Client does not understand that version or any 
higher version, so negotiation fails and client ceases communication with that server. 
 
The version parameter is mandatory in requests other than GetCapabilities. 
 
 
6.3 General HTTP request rules 
 
6.3.1 Overview 
 
At present, the only distributed computing platform (DCP) explicitly supported by OGC 
Web Services is the World Wide Web itself, or more specifically Internet hosts 
implementing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Thus the Online Resource of 
each operation supported by a service instance is an HTTP Uniform Resource Locator 
(URL).  The URL may be different for each operation, or the same, at the discretion of 
the service provider. Each URL must conform to the description in [HTTP] but is 
otherwise implementation-dependent; only the parameters comprising the service request 
itself are mandated by the OGC Web Services specifications. 
 
HTTP supports two request methods: GET and POST. One or both of these methods may 
be defined for a particular OGC Web Service type and offered by a service instance, and 
the use of the Online Resource URL differs in each case. 
 
An Online Resource URL intended for HTTP GET requests is in fact only a URL prefix 
to which additional parameters must be appended in order to construct a valid Operation 
request. A URL prefix is defined as an opaque string including the protocol, hostname, 
optional port number, path, a question mark '?', and, optionally, one or more  
serverspecific parameters ending in an ampersand '&'. The prefix uniquely identifies the 
particular service instance. For HTTP GET, the URL prefix must end in either a '?' (in 
the absence of additional server-specific parameters) or a '&'. In practice, however, 
Clients should be prepared to add a necessary trailing '?' or '&' before appending the 
Operation parameters defined in this specification in order to construct a valid request 
URL. 
 
An Online Resource URL intended for HTTP POST requests is a complete and valid 
URL to which Clients transmit encoded requests in the body of the POST document. A 
GDAS server must not require additional parameters to be appended to the URL in order 
to construct a valid target for the Operation request. 
 
6.3.2 Key-value pair encoding (GET or POST) 
6.3.2.1 Overview 
 



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –©  All rights reserved 
17 

Using Key-Value Pair encoding, a client composes the necessary request parameters as 
keyword/value pairs in the form "keyword=value", separated by ampersands (‘&’), with 
appropriate encoding [IETF RFC 2396] to protect special characters. The resulting query 
string may be transmitted to the server via HTTP GET or HTTP POST, as prescribed in 
the HTTP Common Gateway Interface (CGI) standard [IETF RFC 2616]. 
 
Table 1 summarizes the request parameters for HTTP GET and POST. 
 

Table 1 –Parts of a Key-Value Pair OGC Web Service Request 
URL Component Description 

http://host[:port]/path URL of service operation. The URL is entirely at the discretion of the 
service provider. 

{name[=value]&} The query string, consisting of one or more standard request parameter 
name/value pairs defined by an OGC Web Service. The actual list of 
required and optional parameters is mandated for each operation by the 
appropriate OWS specification. 

Notes: [ ] denotes 0 or 1 occurrence of an optional part; {} denotes 0 or more occurrences. 
 
A request encoded using the HTTP GET method interposes a '?' character between the 
service operation URL and the query string, to form a valid URI which may be saved as a 
bookmark, embedded as a hyperlink, or referenced via Xlink in an XML document. 
 
6.3.2.2 Parameter ordering and case 
 
Parameter names shall not be case sensitive, but parameter values shall be case sensitive. 
In this document, parameter names are typically shown in uppercase for typographical 
clarity, not as a requirement. 
 
Parameters in a request may be specified in any order. 
 
An OGC Web Service must be prepared to encounter parameters that are not part of this 
specification. In terms of producing results per this specification, an OGC Web Service 
shall ignore such parameters. 
 
6.3.2.3 Parameter lists 
 
Parameters consisting of lists shall use the comma (",") as the delimiter between items in 
the list: e.g., parameter=item1,item2,item3. Multiple lists can be specified as the 
value of a parameter by enclosing each list in parentheses ("(", ")"): e.g., 
parameter=(item1a,item1b,item1c),(item2a,item2b,item2c). If a 
parameter name or value includes a space or comma, it shall be escaped using the URL 
encoding rules [IETF RFC 2396]. 
 
6.3.3 XML encoding 
 
Clients may also encode requests in XML for transmission to the server using HTTP 
GET or (more often) HTTP POST. The XML request must conform to the schema 
corresponding to the chosen operation, and the client must send it to the URL listed for 



OGC 04-010r1 

that operation in the server’s Capabilities XML file, in accordance with HTTP POST 
[IETF RFC 2616]). 
 
NOTE To support SOAP messaging, clients need only enclose this XML document in a SOAP 
envelope as follows:

.4 General HTTP response rules 

pon receiving a valid request, the service must send a response corresponding exactly 
 the request as detailed in the appropriate specification. Only in the case of Version 
egotiation (described above) may the server offer a differing result. 

pon receiving an invalid request, the service must issue a Service Exception as 
escribed in Subclause 6.5 below. 

OTE As a practical matter, in the WWW environment a client should be prepared to receive either a valid 
sult, or nothing, or any other result. This is because the client may itself have formed a nonconforming 
quest that inadvertently triggered a reply by something other than an OGC Web Service, because the 
ervice itself may be non-conforming, etc. 

.5 Service exceptions 

pon receiving an invalid request, the service must issue a Service Exception XML 
essage to describe to the client application or its human user the reason(s) that the 
quest is invalid. 

ervice Exception XML must be valid according to the Service Exception XML Schema 
 Subclause A.3, Annex A. In an HTTP environment, the MIME type of the returned 
ML must be "". Specific error messages can be included either as chunks of plain text 
r as XML-like text containing angle brackets ("<" and ">") if included in a character 
ata (CDATA) section as shown in the example of Service Exception XML in Subclause 
.3. 

ervice Exceptions may include exception codes as indicated in Subclause A.3, Annex 
. Servers shall not use these codes for meanings other than those specified. Clients may 
se these codes to automate responses to Service Exceptions.

7 Geolinked Data Access Service operations 

 
A GDAS must have the knowledge about the data it serves (in other words, the service is 
a data dependent service).  The GDAS specification includes two mandatory operations: 

GetCapabilities 
GetData 

 
For each operation three request methods are defined: 
HTTP GET using URL-encoded Key-Value Pairs (KVP). All servers must support this 
method (the regular URL format we’re used to) 
 
HTTP POST using URL-encoded Key-Value Pairs (KVP). This method is optional. 
 
HTTP POST with XML-encoded requests. This method is optional. 

 

7.1 GetCapabilities (required) 
 
7.1.1 General 
The purpose of the GetCapabilities operation is to provide access to general information 
about the service itself and specific information about the available data. 
 
7.1.2 GetCapabilities overview 
The general form of a GetCapabilities request is defined in the Basic Service Elements 
section. . Table 2 outlines the GDAS key-value pairs for the parameters of the 
GetCapabilities request. When making this request of a GDAS, which may offer other 
OGC Web Services as well, it is necessary to indicate that the client seeks information 
about the GDAS in particular. Thus, the SERVICE parameter of the request shall have 
the value "GDAS" as shown in Table 2 below. 
 

TABLE 2:  The parameters of a GetCapabilities request URL 
Request Parameter Required/Optional Description 
Version=0.9.1 Optional Request Version. Defaults to 

the latest available version, 
currently 0.9.1 

Service=GDAS Required Service Type, must be GDAS 
Request=GetCapabilities Required Request Name 

 
 
 
7.1.3 GetCapabilities request parameters 
 
7.1.3.1 VERSION 
The optional VERSION parameter, and its use in version negotiation, is specified in the 
Basic Service Elements section. 



OGC 04-010r1 

 
7.1.3.2 SERVICE 
The required SERVICE parameter indicates which of the available service types at a 
particular service instance is being invoked. This parameter allows the same URL prefix 
to offer Capabilities XML for multiple OGC Web Services.  When invoking 
GetCapabilities on a GDAS that implements this version of the specification or a later 
one, the value "GDAS" shall be used.   
 
7.1.3.3 REQUEST 
The nature of the required REQUEST parameter is specified in the Basic Service 
Elements section. To invoke the GetCapabilities operation, the value "GetCapabilities" 
shall be used.  
 
Here is an example of a KeyValuePair GetCapabilities request using the HTTP GET 
method:

.1.3.4 XML Encoding 
ML encoded GetCapabilities requests use the HTTP POST method with the body of 
e request (POST data) of type text/xml. 

or example, a client may encode a GetCapabilities request in XML as follows: 

 
<GetCapabilities version="0.9.1" service="GDAS"/>
OGC 2004 –

.1.4 GetCapabilities Response 
he Basic Service Elements section specifies general rules about the GetCapabilities 
sponse.   

 the particular case of a GDAS complying with this version of the standard, the 
xtensible Markup Language (XML)[XML 1.0] response shall be valid according to the 
ML schema in Annex A of this document. The schema specifies the required and  
ptional content of the response and how the content is formatted. 

 server's Capabilities XML may reference an exact copy of the schema in Annex A 
stead of the master copy at the URL stated in the Annex. The schema copy shall be 
cated at a fully-qualified and accessible URL to permit XML validating software to 
trieve it. 

 server may comply with other published or experimental versions, in which case it 
all support Version Negotiation as described in the Basic Service Elements section. A

schema for version 0.9.1 was published as an annex to that version of the GDAS 
specification. Other schemas are archived at <http://www.geoconnections.org/>. 
 
The response to a GetCapabilities operation is an XML document that contains the 
capabilities of an implementation of this service, the operations it supports, and the data it 
serves. An example of the results from a GetCapabilities request is found in Annex B: 
 
The GetCapabilities document includes the generic Service and Capability sections 
common to all OGC Web Services. These sections are not described in detail here, apart 
from two fields specific to a GDAS service:  GeolinkidsLimit and AttributeLimit. 
 
The optional <GeolinkidsLimit> element in the service metadata is a positive integer 
indicating the maximum number of GeolinkIds a client is permitted to include in a single 
GetData Request.  If the value of this element is "0", this feature is not supported.  If this 
element is absent, the server imposes no limit. 
 
The optional <AttributeLimit> element in the service metadata is a positive integer 
indicating the maximum number of Attributes a client is permitted to include in a single 
GetData Request.  If this element is absent, the server imposes no limit. 
 
The Capability section contains a GeolinkedData element describing the data available 
on this server.  The GeolinkedData element and its sub-elements describe the attribute 
information available from the GDAS.  The structure of the major GeolinkedData sub-
elements is as follows: 
 
 GeolinkedData 
  Framework   (1 or more framework sub-elements in GeolinkedData) 
   ... 
   Dataset  (1 or more dataset sub-elements for each Framework) 
    ... 
    Attribute (1 or more attribute sub-elements for each Dataset) 
     ... 
 
The GeolinkedData sub-elements are described in more details below. 
 
7.1.4.1 Framework 
The Framework element contains metadata describing the Framework and one or more 
Dataset sub-elements.  The Framework describes a GIS dataset and the Dataset describes 
a set of attributes that could be applied to that layer.  A GDAS provides data for one or 
more frameworks.  The following elements provide metadata about a framework. 
 
7.1.4.1.1 Organization 
The name of the organization that is responsible for maintaining the framework dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.2 Domain 
The Internet domain name of the organization responsible for maintaining the framework 
dataset. 
 



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –22 ©  All rights reserved
 

7.1.4.1.3 Name 
The name of the framework dataset.  Generally the name by which the dataset might be 
identified within a GIS environment. 
 
7.1.4.1.4 Title 
A human readable sentence fragment that might form a title if the framework dataset 
were displayed in map form. 
 
7.1.4.1.5 Description 
A complete description or abstract that describes the framework dataset  
 
7.1.4.1.6 Version 
The version identifier of the framework dataset.  Version “1” can be used where no other 
versioning number is available. 
 
7.1.4.1.7 Release date 
The date that the framework dataset was first released for use.  Alternatively, instead of a 
date, the content may be a version number of the framework dataset.  In either case, this 
uniquely identifies the version of the dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.8 Documentation 
Location (generally a URI) of complete documentation describing the framework dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.9 GeolinkageField 
The key field within the framework dataset (i.e. in the GIS) that is referenced by all 
datasets that apply to this Framework. 
 
7.1.4.1.10 Dataset 
The Dataset element contains metadata describing the data source on the server and one 
or more attributes available for geo-linking.  More than one dataset may be present for 
each Framework.  The following sub-elements provide metadata about a dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.1 Organization 
The name of the organization that is responsible for maintaining the attribute dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.2 Domain 
The Internet domain name of the organization responsible for maintaining the attribute 
dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.3 Name

within the corporate database environment. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.4 Title 
A human readable sentence fragment that might form a title if the attribute dataset were 
displayed in a tabular form. 



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –©  All rights reserved 
23 

 
7.1.4.1.10.5 Description 
A complete description or abstract that describes the attribute dataset.  
 
7.1.4.1.10.6 Version 
The version identifier of the attribute dataset.  Version “1” can be used where no other 
versioning number is available. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.7 Release Date 
The date that the attribute dataset was first released for use.   
 
7.1.4.1.10.8 Documentation 
Location (generally a URI) of complete documentation describing the attribute dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.9 GeolinkageField 
The key field within the attribute dataset (i.e. the corporate database) that references the 
key identifier found in the framework dataset.  Note: The Dataset’s GeolinkageField 
value is a field name in the corporate database, for the geolinkage field used by this 
Dataset and the framework it belongs to. The Framework and Dataset Geolinkage Field 
values (i.e. the field names) do not have to be identical. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.10 Attribute 
The Attribute element describes an attribute from a Dataset that can be retrieved using 
GetData requests.  Note that the duplication of Version, ReleaseDate, and 
Documentation between Dataset and Attribute ensures that this specification allows for 
maximum flexibility in how an organization structures or maintains its databases. More 
than one attribute may be present in a dataset. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.10.1  Name 
The name of the attribute.  Generally the field name of the attribute within the corporate 
database table. 
 
7.1.4.1.10.10.2  Units

Ordinal Ranking (e.g. high=1, medium=2, low=3) 
Measure Numeric measurement or calculated value (e.g.degrees Celsius) 
Count Total number of objects (e.g number of cows) 

Use of these keywords facilitates automation of map legends, and validation of allowable 
calculations.

The date that the attribute was last updated.   
 
7.1.4.1.10.10.8  Documentation 
Location (generally a URI) of complete documentation describing the attribute. 
 
 
7.2 GetData operation (required) 
This operation provides a means for a client to retrieve geolinked data. The geolinked 
data (attribute values) are returned to a client as an XML document. 
 
Note: Some extremely simple implementations of GDAS may support only a single set of 
attributes for one geographic dataset, stored as a static file, rather than as a dynamic XML 
stream generated in response to a GetData request.. It is expected that those 
implementations would ignore any of the GetData parameters that are passed to the 
server, even the ones that are marked as required below. (This is compatible with the 
default of behavior of HTTP servers serving static documents which ignore the 
QUERY_STRING part of a GET URL that points to a static document.) 
 
7.2.1 Key-value Pair Encoding 
The following keywords are defined for KeyValuePair GetData requests: 
 

TABLE 4:  The parameters of a GetData request URL 
Request Parameter Required/Optional Description 
Service=GDAS Required Service Type 
Request=GetData Required Request Name 
Version=0.9.1 Required Request Version 
FrameworkDomain Required See below

A sample GetData request is shown in Annex B.4: 
 
7.2.2 XML Encoding 
A sample XML-encoded GetData request is shown in Annex B.5: 
 
7.2.3 GetData Request Parameters 
 
7.2.3.1 Service 
Service specifies the type of service being requested. For GDAS services, the only valid 
value is “GDAS”.  This is to allow other OGC services to be delivered from the same 
URL. 
 
7.2.3.2 Request 
Request specifies the type of request being made. For a GetData request, the only valid 
value is “GetData” 
 
7.2.3.3 Version 
The version of the GDAS service requested, for this version of the specification the value 
is "0.9.1". 
 
7.2.3.4 FrameworkDomain 
The domain name that uniquely identifies the agency responsible for the framework - e.g. 
ec.gc.ca 
 
7.2.3.5 FrameworkName 
Framework specifies the geospatial dataset to which the attributes should apply (this 
allows a GDAS to support multiple frameworks from a single instance - e.g. provinces, 
and counties, although only one Framework/Dataset combination can be accommodated 
within any one GetData query). 
 
7.2.3.6 FrameworkVersion 
The version identifier of the framework dataset.  Note that FrameworkVersion is only 
used in the KVP encoding for an HTTP request using the GET or POST methods.  
Version is used in an HTTP request when using XML in a POST method. 
 
7.2.3.7 DatasetDomain 
The domain name that uniquely identifies the agency responsible for the attribute data. 
 
7.2.3.8 DatasetName 
Dataset specifies the attribute dataset from which the attributes should be drawn (this 
allows a GDAS to support multiple geolinked datasets - e.g. climate normals for 1991, 
and climate normals for 2001). 
 
7.2.3.9 Attribute 
The Attribute parameter identifies the specific variable(s) being requested (e.g. mean 
monthly temperature for July).   



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –26 ©  All rights reserved
 

 
Note that all attributes in a GetData request must be from a single geolinked dataset. 
 
In Key-Value Pair mode, the value of ATTRIBUTE is a comma-delimited list of 1 or 
more attribute names, e.g. 

ATTRIBUTE=cows,heifers,totcattle 
 

In an XML-encoded request, there is one <Attribute>...</Attribute> element for each 
attribute in the request. 
 
7.2.3.10 GeolinkIds 
The optional GEOLINKIDS parameter can be used to limit the number of records that 
will be returned by the server. If this parameter is omitted then all records from the 
dataset are returned. 
 
In KeyValuePair mode, the value is a comma-delimited list of values of the 
GeolinkageField for the selected dataset, e.g. 

GEOLINKIDS=BC,AL,SA,MA 
Note that when id values are part of a Key-value Pair Encoding request, then the 
encoding will have to form a valid URL. 
In an XML-encoded request, the <GeolinkIds> element contains one <I>...</I> element 
for each value. 
 
7.2.4 GetData Response 
The response to a GetData request shall be defined by the XML schema found in Annex 
C.  The schema specifies the required and optional content of the response and how the 
content is formatted.  A server's GetData XML may reference an exact copy of the 
schema in Annex A instead of the master copy at the URL stated in the Annex. The 
schema copy shall be located at a fully-qualified and accessible URL to permit XML 
validating software to retrieve it. 
 
A server may comply with other published or experimental versions, in which case it 
shall support Version Negotiation as described in the Basic Service Elements section. A 
schema for version 0.9.0 was published as an annex to that version of the GDAS 
specification. Other schemas are archived at <http://www.geoconnections.org/>. 
 
The response to a GetData operation is an XML document that contains the requested 
data.  A sample response to a GetData request is found in Annex B. 
 
7.2.4.1 Response Structure 
The body of the response is a GDAS_Data element which includes a single Framework 
element corresponding to the requested Framework. The Framework element in turn 
contains a Dataset element for the dataset specified in the GetData request. The 
Framework and Dataset elements also contain a copy of their respective metadata 
(identical to what was found in the capabilities). 
 



OGC 04-010r1 

OGC 2004 –©  All rights reserved 
27 

Finally the Dataset element contains one or more Attribute sub-elements, and exactly one 
rowset element. These are described in more details below. 
 
7.2.4.2 Attribute elements 
The Dataset element in the response contains one Attribute element for each of the 
attributes included in the request. Each attribute element includes metadata about the 
attribute, basically a copy of what was also found in the capabilities. 
 
7.2.4.3 Rowset 
The Rowset is a sub-element of the Dataset. It contains 1 or more Row elements, one for 
each record of data requested by the client. 
 
 
7.2.4.3.1 Row 
Each Row consists of an <I> (id) element with the value of the GeolinkageField for this 
record, followed by one <V> (value) tag for each selected attribute. The first <V> value 
in a row corresponds to the first attribute, the second <V> value corresponds to the 
second attribute and so on. 
 
7.2.4.3.1.1   I 
An identifier (e.g. polygon identifier) that indicates which geospatial feature this data 
applies to.  This identifier is found in the Geolinkage Field of the Framework Dataset (i.e. 
City name in the example given in the introduction.) 
 
7.2.4.3.1.2   V 
The value of the attribute for that geospatial feature identified by <V> above.  
 
Example of a Rowset when two attributes were selected for three features: 
 
 
<Rowset> 
  <Row> 
    <I>1</I> 
    <V>-33.61772</V> 
    <V>12.8</V> 
  </Row> 
  <Row> 
    <I>5</I> 
    <V>-27.45909</V> 
    <V>23.4</V> 
  </Row> 
  <Row> 
    <I>6</I> 
    <V>-26.90000</V> 
    <V>15.3</V> 
  </Row> 
</Rowset>

Annex C 
(informative) 

 
Changes from previous versions of the GDAS specification 

 

C.1 Introduction 

Previous versions of this specification were prepared under the auspices of the 
Geoconnections (Natural Resouces Canada).  This annex details changes made to earlier 
versions of the specification produced by that organization. 

C.2 Changes between version 0.8.2 and 0.9.0 

• Added the ability to request multiple attributes in a single request: 
• New ATTRIBUTES request parameter 
• Former ATTRIBUTE parameter deprecated 
• Set maxOccurs=unbounded for <Attribute> and <V> in GetData response 

schema 
• Added the ability to pass a filter in the GetData request using the optional 

GeolinkIds parameter 
• Made some parameters of GetData mandatory (they were all optional before) and 

added a note explaining that simple/static services can still operate in that context. 
• Added definition of XML-encoded POST requests (GetCapabilities and 

GetData). 
• Modified the GetCapabilities example to use text/xml instead of custom MIME 

types 
• (application/cgdi.gdas_xml and application/cgdi.error_xml) in the Service 

definitions.  
• Allow one or more Datasets inside a Framework in Capabilities (we used to be 

limited to one Dataset per Framework). Updated the text of the spec and the 
Capabilities schema accordingly. 

 
C.2 Changes between version 0.9.0 and 0.9.1  

• Reverted to Attribute parameter in all cases.  Attributes parameter from 0.9.0 no 
longer valid. 

• Changed Framework_Version to FrameworkVersion in KVP encoding. 
• Added <GeolinkidsLimit> to indicate if the service supports selection of specific 

GeoLink Ids. 
• Added <AttributeLimit> to indicate if the service supports simultaneous retrieval 

of multiple attributes. 
• Changed <ROW> to <Row> 
• Changed <ROWSET> to <Rowset> 
• Made additional parameters of GetData mandatory. 



OGC 04-010r1

• Dropped MIME type "application/vnd.ogc.*" in favour of "text/xml"  
• Changed Domain to FrameworkDomain in GetData request 
• Changed Framework to FrameworkName in GetData request 
• Added DatasetDomain to GetData request 
• Changed Dataset to DatasetName in GetData request 
• Changed Interval to Measure in Attribute.Type 
• Changed Ratio to Count in Attribute.Type 
• Changed Attribute.Type keywords to mandatory
