1 Executive	abstract	
Indoor location technologies are enjoying and increasing market success. Technologies in 
the market have achieved maturity and have become a key driver for innovation and 
business activities in several value added scenarios, e.g. e-government services, eHealth, 
personal mobility, logistics, mobility, facility management, retail, to name but a few. 

This paper collects the results of a survey on the benefits of indoor location, which was 
jointly prepared and launched by OGC – the Open Geospatial Consortium, InLocation 
Alliance and i-locate project at the beginning of 2016. Overall, 153 survey responses were 
received from 33 countries.   Responses were categorized in two areas: Client Organizations 
and Technology suppliers. 

The goal of the initiative was to acquire a broad view of the requirements and use cases 
emerging from the wider industrial and user community, beyond the memberships of the 
various organizations, in order to capture trends, challenges and opportunities, as well as 
trends and barriers to widespread use of indoor location technologies. 

This paper does not represent a view of the membership involved in the different 
organizations; instead, it provides the opportunity to capture recommendations of relevance 
for the industrial and standardization community these organizations represent.

5 Introduction	
We spend large share of our time indoors, be this at home, at work, while shopping or 
travelling, often in unfamiliar environments. Indoor Location Based Services (LBS) are not 
just an extension of outdoor location applications but they represent a true driver for 
innovation & business activities in several value added scenarios across a variety of 
domains such as e-government, eHealth, personal mobility, logistics, mobility, facility 
management, retail, etc. If compared to outdoor location services, the wide range of human 
activities that take place in indoor environments yield brand new use cases with unique 
requirements and challenges. These innovative use cases will affect most human activities 
by redefining our relationships with the indoor environment and our knowledge about the 
interactions and between businesses and their customers, companies and their employees 
and assets, and among each other.  

According to recent market analysis1 the market of indoor LBS will keep expanding at fast 
rate growing almost five-fold from 2014 to 2019, reaching $4,424.1 million at a Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 36.5% [20]. 

This report collects results of a survey launched as a joint activity of ILA, OGC and I-locate, 
organizations with different missions, membership and approaches yet sharing the view that 
coordinating efforts in the domain of indoor location will have beneficial effects on market 
uptake of these technologies. The survey was launched at the beginning of 2016 and 
collected responses from 153 users from 33 countries.  

The survey was envisaged to respond to the need to assess and report a state of the market 
by collecting and analyzing the “sentiment” of a large number people from companies 
operating from different perspectives and at different levels in this emerging field. In 
particular, the survey was aimed at surveying the benefits of indoor location and acquiring a 
broad view of the requirements and use cases emerging from the wider industrial and user 
community, beyond the memberships of the various organizations, in order to capture 
trends, challenges and opportunities, as well as trends and barriers to widespread use of 
indoor location technologies. 

The success of the survey, in terms of number of respondents and of overall quality of the 
feedback received, has allowed the definition of a complete and clear landscape. The results 
will be distributed to the different memberships, helping promote future standards 
development at OGC and industrial development among members of ILA and made 
accessible also to all the interested readers from the institutional web sites.

Lastly, over the course of the survey, we received the interest from the Location Based 
Marketing Association - LBMA (www.thelbma.com/), which promoted the initiative among 
their membership. We would like to thank LBMA for the valuable collaboration.

6 Rationale	and	background		
At the end of 2015, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [15], the InLocation Alliance 
(ILA) [14] and the European Commission funded project i-locate [16], jointly decided to 
promote a survey on indoor location, to provide the three organizations with a current 
snapshot of the requirements of different stakeholders (within and beyond OGC and ILA 
members), so that the organizations will have an up-to-date overview of the market for 
indoor positioning.  

At later stages of the survey, the survey received the attention of the Location Based 
Marketing Association - LBMA [13], an international group dedicated to fostering use of 
location based services among its members (retailers, agencies, advertisers, media buyers, 
software and services providers, and wireless companies). Following a sincere spirit of 
cooperation we decided to extend the survey and promote the initiative among their 
members.  

6.1 The	different	communities	involved	

6.1.1 Open	Geospatial	Consortium	-	OGC	
 The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [15] is an international 
industry consortium of over 519 companies, government agencies 
and universities participating in a consensus process to develop 
publicly available interface standards. OGC® Standards support 

interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the Web, wireless and location-based services and 
mainstream IT. The standards empower technology developers to make complex spatial 
information and services accessible and useful with all kinds of applications. 

6.1.2 InLocation	Alliance	-	ILA	 	 	 	
The InLocation Alliance (ILA) [14], a Federation Member 
program of the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology 
Organization (IEEE-ISTO), was formally established August 
2012. ILA was founded by the mobile industry to accelerate 

the adoption of indoor position solutions that will enhance the mobile experience by opening 
up new opportunities for consumers and venue owners. 

The overall vision is that consumers will benefit from personalized, contextual information 
and offers, as well as new services such as indoor navigation. Venue owners will benefit 
from increased customer satisfaction and enhanced information on customer behavior. 

ILA has released and maintains a framework architecture for the development of indoor 
location based systems [19]. The relevant White Paper can be downloaded free of charge 
from the ILA website.

6.1.3 i-locate	project	 	 		 	 		 	 	
The project i-locate “Indoor/outdoor LOCation and Asset management 
Through open gEodata” [16] is a Pilot B type project funded by the 
European Commission through the ICT-PSP (Information and 
Communication Technology Program). Goals of the project were to 

create a public geoportal to collect, make discoverable and provide access to indoor 
geographical information of publicly accessible buildings as Open Data, as well as an open 
source “toolkit” for integrated hybrid (indoor-outdoor) LBS for location, tracking of asset and 
people as well as their routing based on open standard protocols. Toolkit is the first 
reference implementation of the OGC standard “IndoorGML”. 

6.1.4 General	public	
Last but not least, the survey was opened also to the general public, through an extensive 
web-based campaign (including institutional websites, LinkedIn groups etc.) and press 
releases. The goal was to capture feedback from experts, venue owners and other 
stakeholders, far beyond the scope of the “professional” communities beyond OGC, ILA and 
i-locate. 

From the analysis of collected data, it is clear that most of the responders were from 
technology providers or product suppliers, followed by location service providers and, lastly, 
from client organizations (Fig. 1).  

 

Fig. 1: An overview of the different macro-groups of respondents who contributed to 
the survey during the three phases, as detailed later in the following section. 

6.2 The	different	phases	of	the	survey	
The survey was launched 10 January, closing on 22 February following three phases in 
which the link was distributed among different participating communities. 

Initially the survey was shared only with members of the participating organizations, i.e. ILA, 
OGC and I-locate. During the second phase the survey was shared with a wider audience 
through press releases and the use of major specialized sites and magazines as well as 
through professionally oriented social networks.

Fig. 2: An overview of the timing of the three different phases and the involvement of 
the different expert communities. 

During the initial phase, interest in participating was received by the Location Based 
Marketing Association (LBMA) and a third phase was initiated for the February 12 through 
February 22 time period. In the first phase 82 submissions were received followed by 59 in 
the second phase and 12 in the third phase. Overall, 153 submissions were received from 
33 countries. 44 submissions came from Italy alone, 32 from the United States and 10 from 
Spain.

7 Methodology	of	the	survey	
The schema of the survey is described in Fig. 3. 

After a block of questions meant to acquire “general info” about the participants together with 
their expertise and role in the value chain, the survey separates the responders into two 
main legs: Client Organizations redirected towards the left leg and Technology suppliers 
towards the right leg. 

Each box corresponds to a number of detailed questions, typically from two to five. 

 

Fig. 3: Structure of the survey 

Client organizations such as venue owners or tenants constitute an important category that 
is key to the entire indoor location value chain since they invest in both infrastructure and 
application development and require solutions that will integrate easily with current networks 
and vertical IT solutions already in place. 

Facility managers represent another key group of client organizations. Often facility 
managers are proprietaries or have outsourcing contracts for the maintenance of real 
estates including security, surveillance and technical maintenance services related to 
heating, water pipes, lighting and similar infrastructure. The facility managers are 
technologically aware of new evolutions and use Building Information Models (BIMs)

including 3D models of the buildings for running the whole building lifecycle from design, 
construction and maintenance. 

The main goal of surveying customer organizations was to understand their perceived 
benefits, barriers and readiness to invest. Further, the survey reported a perceived lack in 
the Indoor location standards. Finally some additional use cases were solicited. This was not 
the main aim of the survey: this additional question was proposed to elicit some use cases 
not covered in the previous questions and respondents were very collaborative, proposing 
new insights into applications. 

Technology suppliers represented the vast majority of the respondents, as expected. 
When surveying this community the goal was to understand how they manage to deliver a 
complete business solution to client organizations. The picture is rather complex as multiple 
business roles are involved and their characterization is still evolving. 

To avoid biases due to the order in which options are proposed to respondents, we 
extensively used the re-shuffling feature that allows proposing the identified options in a 
random sequence.

8 Analysis	of	the	results	

8.1 Participants		
Most of the respondents were developers of indoor location systems. Approximately a 
quarter of the total answers came from users, whose point of view is fundamental to draw a 
better picture of this rapidly evolving market. Those classifying themselves as users came 
mostly from member organizations (30 out of 36 responses in this category were collected 
during the first phase of the survey). Developers outnumbered users in both phase 2 and 3. 

In general, all respondents are directly involved in the indoor positioning market and are 
knowledgeable of the dynamics. 

 

Finding  1. Software application developers represent  the majority of the 
respondents, this confirms the fact that indoor positioning provides benefits to 
context based applications that have to be customized to the intended customers 
and adapted to the single venues. 

 

The survey registered a good participation from Academia and R&D centers and this 
witnesses the fact that the technologies and solutions in this field are still in progress. Also 
the participation of a good number of consultants witnesses the fact that experts are needed 
to seize the solutions correctly. 

Most of the respondents are technology suppliers, they outnumber both customers and 
service providers.

Fig. 4: The different respondent groups2 

Client organizations appear to be increasingly interested to the monitoring of the building 
resources and how those resources are dynamically consumed to keep track and optimize 
resource allocation. This use case is increasingly present; complementing the more popular 
offline heath maps and analytics. Examples are the dynamic allocation of desks in a 
corporate building, meeting boxes in a convention center, or parking lots. 

This leg of the survey was specifically meant to address the needs, requirements and 
readiness to invest of this population. 

The supplier leg is also really variegated. Participants included representatives of all 
members of the value chain, from infrastructure and device developers, down to platforms 
and maps providers to consultants and system integrators. 

The content of this document, although not reporting step by step each answer, is grounded 
on those answers and presents and comments the results given. 

The analysis of results starts with a self-assessment phase. Respondents had to declare 
their experience, their industry of provenience and their roles in the value chain. 

Then both communities were asked the technological features of interest directly referring to 
indoor positioning features. The proposed questions assume that the indoor positioning 
technology contributes to extend the high level features of vertical systems. 

In Section 8.4 this report goes through the main requirements that can be technical, 
operational and normative with different levels of interest. That section is based on a large 
number of detailed open answers. Respondents were very collaborative and focused on a 
number of different complementary issues.

The following sections will focus on the expected and perceived benefits as well as the 
barriers to entry. The aim is always to take a 3D image both from the eye of the suppliers 
and from the eye of the customers. 

To correctly interpret the resulting picture, we have also to note that most of the respondents 
from customer organizations (e.g. hospitals) are from the IT department and are involved in 
the setup and maintenance of the service towards their internal users such as doctors, 
patients and nurses. Their technical knowledge is often remarkable and the resulting findings 
even more valuable. 

8.2 Participating	industry	
If we consider the top three Customer Organization industries, there is a prevalence of 
health and care services. While this market is certainly one of the most promising, this bias 
reflects the composition of the participants to the i-locate project that focuses mainly on 
health care and public offices and administrations. 

A similar bias is also reflected in the ranking of industries targeted by suppliers. Health care 
tops the preferences of the responding suppliers. Retail and Transportation confirm the 
interest already observed in 2015 when ILA published two white papers listing the use cases 
in these industries. 

                          Customer Organizations Industries targeted by the Supplier 
Organizations 

1. Health, (Hospital and Clinics etc.) 
2. Care services for aging people 
3. Culture, entertainment and other public 

facilities 

1. Health (hospital, clinics etc.) 
2. Retail 
3. Transportation and personal mobility 

 

The rankings above reflect the current perception of where the low hanging fruits can be 
found. Even more importantly, respondents have reported current activities addressing more 
than 20 different industries, which witnesses the wide applicability of indoor positioning 
solutions. Other respondents openly declare their independence from the receiving industry: 
this is the case of players focusing on components and basic building blocks that can be 
found upper in the value chain. 

 

Finding  2. Indoor positioning technologies appear to be applicable to a wide 
range of use cases in a wide range of industries

8.3 Low	level	features	of	interest	

8.3.1 For	location	of	people	
Our survey reveals close alignment between consumers and suppliers of the features they 
prioritized in systems that locate and track people.  The features identified in this category 
fall into two distinct groups: those where location information is determined in the visitor’s 
device and those where location information is determined in the network environment.  In 
the former category, both consumers and suppliers of location technologies reported a 
strong interest in navigation, guidance, and real-time positioning features required to enable 
way-finding and visitor engagement applications.  In the latter category, both also showed 
similar levels of interest in analytics, geo-fencing, proximity detection, and other features 
related to establishing context-aware environments.

Fig. 7: Most important features for location of people (for suppliers) 

While no direct indication of a preferred architecture can be seen in these responses, the 
widespread interest in enabling people to locate themselves and in enabling networks to 
locate them in the environment would tend to suggest a market favoring solutions capable of 
supporting both. 

One area of apparent divergence is evident in location-based marketing.  While identified as 
an application of interest by a significant number of suppliers, none of the customer 
organizations surveyed indicated this as a feature of interest. 

8.3.2 For	location	of	objects	
As we turn to systems designed to locate and track objects, we continue to see alignment 
between customer organizations and suppliers, with asset tracking and real-time positioning 
a clear priority.  In contrast to systems designed to locate people, analytics is apparently a 
lower priority for organizations interested in locating objects.

Fig. 9: Most important features for location of people (for client suppliers) 

8.4 Indoor	positioning	requirements	
Our survey asked specifically about accuracy requirements.  As could be expected from the 
broad range of use cases, accuracy requirements also ranged from sub-meter to simple 
presence detection.  The most frequent response from both consumers and suppliers 
indicated an expectation of 1-meter accuracy.  It is unclear whether this represents a 
predominance of use cases that require this level of accuracy or the fact that this has been a 
long established target of the industry.   

 

Finding 3. Given the typical relationship between cost and performance, it would 
appear that both suppliers and consumers believe there is a threshold of around 1 
meter accuracy, below which costs rise and applications become more 
specialized. 

 

Below we will consider responses relating to other performance parameters, such as 
latency, orientation, the ability to track legacy devices, power consumption (which would 
likely be a major consideration in battery-operated tags and beacons), the maximum number 
of simultaneously trackable devices, and the cost of deployment and maintenance.

The goal of section on “Indoor positioning requirements” was to capture any specific 
requirement related to indoor positioning, through additional feedback, in the form of free 
text, which could complement the input received within the previous sections, which instead 
were meant to collect structured feedback. 

8.4.1 Client	organizations	
The results emerging from data collected during the first leg of the survey, which captured 
feedbacks from client organizations and venue owners, highlight two clear sets of 
requirements: 1) the need for additional integration capabilities and, 2) the need of 
detecting user’s attitude or posture (i.e. leaning, laid down, facing direction).  

The former requirement is consistent with the clear need for interoperable solutions which 
also emerges in later sections of the questionnaire. This, in turn, is consistent with perceived 
lack of standardization, which has clearly emerged as one of the most relevant barriers 
preventing adoption of indoor location, as detailed in the sections on “barriers and 
constraints” to use of indoor location, further reinforcing the relevance of the aforementioned 
requirement. 

Importance of having integrated and interoperable technologies has been extended to 
inclusion of tools beyond provision of mere indoor positioning or location features, to include, 
for instance, data analytics tools.  

 

Finding 4. The survey highlights the need for interoperable frameworks and 
platforms capable to deliver value-added services by leveraging on indoor 
positioning technology as a commodity.  

 

The second major requirement, that is to be able to detect user’s attitude, highlights the 
need for even more sophisticated technologies than those available today, clearly showing 
the high expectation around the domain of indoor positioning, in domains such as safety and 
monitoring, retail, personalized training, health and care. 

 

Additional note. The responses have in particular highlighted the importance of being 
able to locate sub-body measurements in domains such as:  

● Safety and monitoring, for instance in case of specialized applications 
engineered to ensure workers’ safety within dangerous working environments or in 
case of applications targeted to monitoring of old person (e.g. to identify if they 
have fallen down, etc.). 

● Retail, to be able to analyze detailed purchasing behaviors (for instance if a 
customer has tried to lean down to pick an object on the lower shelf of a food 
store).  

● Personal training, to analyze if trainees are doing the proper physical exercise as 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

24 of 84 

indicated by their personal trainer. 
● Health and care, where tracking of body limbs can be important for medical 

applications (e.g. diagnostic, post trauma rehabilitation, etc.). This very requirement 
has consistently emerged also in later section, where multiple users have 
responded explicitly highlighting use cases based on location of elderly people and 
analysis of their postures. 

However, it should be noted that such a very specific feedback may have been biased by 
response from the i-locate community, which addresses, to a significant extent, the 
healthcare market where this requirement is rather strong.

8.4.2 Suppliers	
When analyzing the recommendations collected by the second leg of the survey, which has 
mostly captured feedback from technical suppliers, it becomes clear that a large set of 
different needs emerge, addressing several -often very technical- issues. Overall needs can 
be grouped in three main categories:  

1. technical (location) requirements, 
2. operational requirements,  
3. data model and standardization requirements. 

 

Technical requirements 

The first technical requirements referred to the need for location technologies capable to 
detect proximity of all devices in the nearby area, be this connected or not, hence including 
development of systems capable to collect information from passive devices. With regard 
to connected devices, one of the most important requirements is very low power 
consumption. In case of network-centric location systems, the network should also be 
capable to locate any device within the area served by the wireless network with location 
response characterized by low latency (<500 ms) even with very high number of mobile 
devices connected to the network, therefore ensuring high scalability. 

 

Finding  5. Suppliers need scalable and low-latency indoor location technologies 
capable to collect data from passive or very low power devices. 

 

Additional note. It should be noted that some of these requirement partially conflict with 
current privacy and data security legal frameworks, as highlighted later in the document. In 
addition, the combination of these requirements is essentially consistent with results of a 
later section on barriers to use of indoor location systems which highlight, among other 
barriers, the limited accuracy, long latency and short battery life of many technologies 
used today. 

 

Further requisites for indoor positioning solution include seamless integration with outdoor 
solutions and concerted use of multiple positioning technologies at once. From a purely 
location technology standpoint, the survey has suggested wider adoption of emerging 
solutions based on Visible Light Communication (VLC), including, for instance, LED-
based indoor location technologies. 

 

Finding  6. To be able to make concerted use of multiple positioning technologies 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

26 of 84 

at once. 

 

Additional note. It should be noted that, as from the previous requirement, this is 
consistent with results of a later section on barriers to use of indoor location systems, 
which have highlighted the difficulty to identify the right mix of technologies for each 
specific solution.  
Additionally, with regard to VLC-based solutions, their widespread use may also be 
influenced by emerging legal frameworks limiting RF-pollution, as detailed in later section 
discussing barriers to use of indoor location. 

 

Operational requirements 

Among operational requirements, usability has been regarded as of high priority. This 
regards both usability aspects related to end users as well as to those involved in the 
configuration and data preparation steps with particular regard to creation of indoor maps. 
With regards to the former, the survey has highlighted that current software interface data 
preparation are far too complex for non-expert use. Specific mention to use of 3D interfaces 
for data preparation and indoor mapping (including creation of indoor paths) has been 
highlighted by the survey. 

 

Additional note. It should be noted that some of the need for simple tools for creation of 
indoor maps and indoor connection graphs (e.g. as in the case of IndoorGML) may 
emerge from the i-locate community, which has attempted to provide a partial answer to 
improve user-friendliness during data creation phase with the development of a plugin for 
JOSM, the specialized software developed by the OpenStreetMap community, that has 
been extended to allow creation of indoor graphs based on IndoorGML standard. 
However, the final result is far for being usable by the general public in that it requests 
specific knowledge for using JOSM. 

 

A similar requirement regarded the availability of indoor location solutions available for all 
the platforms in the market including, most notably, the various Operating Systems for 
desktop and mobile devices. 

 

Finding  7. Indoor positioning solutions should be available on multi-platforms 
including desktop and mobile device operating systems. 

 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

27 of 84 

Further requirements from an operational standpoint, included development of automatic 
procedures for reduction of installation and setup costs, which ultimately should be 
carried on by customers or venue owners (without requiring specific knowledge). 

 

Finding  8. To develop tools for automatic system configuration of the location 
infrastructure. 

 

A last requirement regarded the need to create interfaces for IT and management 
systems, in order to facilitate deployment and integration with existing infrastructures. 

 

Data model and standardization requirements 

Lastly, from the data structure and standardization point of view, the survey has clearly 
highlighted the need for tighter integration of indoor location systems with BIM 
solutions. With regards to feedback received by the OGC community, specific mention has 
been made to achieving integration of indoor location data, also in the context of 
transactional services, within a large range of OGC standards, as detailed in the concluding 
sections of the document. 

A specific mention has been also made to achieving integration of indoor location data 
with OASIS standards in order to provide improved support to operators in mission critical 
environments, such as first responders in case of emergencies or military users. 

 

Finding  9. To ensure wider support of indoor location data types and functions in 
OGC and OASIS standards  

 

8.5 Barriers	and	constraints	to	use	of	indoor	location		
The section on “Barriers and constraints” was specifically targeted to collect, from 
respondents, perceived barriers and constraints to the use of indoor location solutions. 
Similarly to previous sections, the survey has allowed emphasizing differences between 
client organizations and suppliers.  

8.5.1 Client	organizations	
When observing results collected from client organizations, it is clear that privacy emerges 
as the top concern. Privacy and data protection legislations have risen very high concerns, in 
particular in very sensitive domains such as health and care, (e.g. the person being tracked 
may not be able to provide explicit consent, hence requiring consent to collection of 
positioning data to be given by a proxy), and whenever this requires storing of positioning 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

28 of 84 

data related to healthcare information (e.g. for monitoring purposes), which are typically 
subject to very strict legal requirements.  

 

Fig. 12: Top barriers and constraints to use of indoor location for client organizations 

 

Finding  10. Within client organizations, “privacy” is regarded as the most 
important barrier to indoor location. 

  

Additional note. Within client organizations, “privacy” has also received the highest 
number of comments (as free text) within the section titled “do you know of any legal 
barrier to use of indoor location”. This consistently reinforces the perception by client 
organizations of privacy being as the most important barriers to widespread use of indoor 
location, due to complexity of national and international legal frameworks. 

  

In fact, free text responses within section titled “do you know of any legal barrier to use of 
indoor location” have highlighted, besides the existence of international directives (e.g. from 
the European Commission), the potential impact of perhaps more restrictive legal 
frameworks at national levels. Responses have highlighted, for example, the importance of 
restrictive laws in countries such as the Netherlands, where CPB, the Netherlands Bureau 
for Economic Policy Analysis is requiring a verification charge of verifying that data are 
collected anonymously and deleted after 48 hours. Similar restrictive legislation has been 
reported in Luxembourg, where law forbids tracking workers, or in Italy, which has one of the 
most restrictive legal frameworks in terms of privacy and data protection.  

 

Additional note. It is worth noting that all the comments related to privacy and data 
security issues have been provided by responders from European countries, clearly 
showing cultural and social differentiation with regards to perceived impact of data security 
and privacy, which makes people from European Countries far more sensitive to these 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

29 of 84 

issues if compared to those living in other geographical areas of the world. 

Privacy requirement is particularly strong in Europe where an articulated international legal 
framework is in force including, but not limited to, the Convention for the Protection of 
Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data [3], the Directive 
95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the 
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free 
movement of such data [4] and the Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the 
protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and 
Electronic Communications) [5]. 

These results suggested the need for wider adoption of structured approaches to privacy 
protection in the context of location-based services (e.g. instance following design 
paradigms such as “privacy by design”). 

 

Most interestingly, the availability of standardized indoor location technologies has been 
perceived as the second strongest barrier. A detailed discussion on this issue is proposed in 
the following section, where the results received from the suppliers are discussed. 

 

Finding  11. Within client organizations, standard products and services are seen 
as a means to reducing risks related to widespread adoption of a new technology 
and to ensuring integration with their IT infrastructure. 

 

Further high-priority barriers include lack of integration with IT infrastructures (it should be 
noted that this requirement clearly emerged also in previous parts of the survey as detailed). 
The integration with IT infrastructure is perceived as important in order to be able to 
maximize benefits of location technologies. The integration anyway is often difficult to 
achieve and evaluate, especially when the suppliers offer standalone platforms. 

Further barriers, albeit to lesser extent, have been selected by respondents including data 
security, quality and workflow management tools, and electromagnetic interferences.  

When asked, within a dedicated section, to “describe your experience (if any) with barriers 
preventing adoption of indoor location”, respondents reported the most relevant real-life 
examples highlighting existing barriers preventing use of indoor location.  

In general terms, the results of this section can grouped into barriers related to: 1) technical 
factors, 2) human factors and 3) business model aspects, as follows. It is important to 
note the following items are prioritized as no specific metric had been given to the 
respondent to rank experience.   

Among the barriers related to technical factors, the following have been highlighted: 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

30 of 84 

● The presence of devices generating electromagnetic fields (e.g. photocopiers) may 
cause electromagnetic interferences (in case of indoor location systems based on 
electromagnetic technologies) which may affect accuracy. Experience of use of 
complementary location technologies has been reported to minimize overall 
inefficiency and/or inaccuracy. 

● Lack of standardized solutions, with a specific mention of proprietary Wi-Fi based 
solutions.  

● Difficulty to rely on users owned devices, most notably smartphones or tablets, 
due to large variety of products available. Depending on use cases this may make 
use of tag-based solution preferable.  

 

Finding  12. Customer organizations are well aware that the indoor LBSs can be 
exploited only as a combination of different technologies cooperating. 

 

A large number of barriers related to human or cultural factors including: 

● Motivation of the end user to subscribe to indoor location services.  
● Reluctance and/or mistrust by specific user groups, including most notably elderly 

people, to accept the use of indoor location technologies.  
 

Finding  13. Other concerns among customer organizations refer to the level of 
engagement of people in using location-based services, therefore overcoming lack 
of motivation, reluctance or mistrust to technology. 

 

The third group includes a range of barriers related to business model aspects, including: 

● The need for upfront investments related to both data capturing and creation as 
well as infrastructural and hardware costs. 

● Final cost to the end users.  
● Not being able to select when to opt-in or opt-out from the service when in public 

spaces.  
● Providing indoor location services in private buildings, which are, open to 

public, such as stations or airports.  
 

Additional note. Most notably, in addition to the aforementioned barriers, a positive 
experience has been reported which included use of LBMA DACH code of conduct.  

  

Additional note. Looking at the answers to this section we notice that less than half of the 
respondents among customer’s organizations has reported a barrier. Further that, none of 
the listed barriers has attracted a wide consensus. Those reporting barriers have 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

31 of 84 

described a wide variety of problems of different nature that suggests that this new 
technology simply requires solid commitment and project structure to obtain valuable 
benefits. 

8.5.2 Suppliers	
When analyzing responses from the supplier community, the results share the same top 
three concerns mentioned also by customers, although the priority among the top items 
changes. Results of the survey have clearly, and quite predictably, shown that the lack of 
standard indoor positioning technologies represents the single most important barrier to 
be addressed. It is interesting to note that lack of standardized technology is perceived by far 
as the most important barrier, generating twice as much the number of preferences from the 
second items (two with equal score) in the list, which is the integration with IT 
infrastructures and privacy.  

 

Finding  14. Supplier organizations consider lack of standard indoor positioning 
technology as the most important barrier. 

 

Fig. 13: Top barriers and constraints to use of indoor location for suppliers 

 

Finding  15. Client and supplier organizations share the same top three barriers 
although with different priority. 

 

One may argue that, while the former still emphasizes the importance of standards (in that 
the use of standards facilitates integration with IT infrastructures), the latter (i.e. “privacy”), 
shows a very different issue that, however, has received significant attention. Integration with 
IT organization is viewed as a barrier, possibly due to the rich variety of solutions that can be 
found in customer organizations. 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

32 of 84 

In fact, it is worth noting that, similarly to what expressed by client organizations, privacy has 
been by far the topic that received the highest number of comments (as free text) within 
section titled “Do you know of any legal barrier to use of indoor location?” This clearly 
highlights that also the technical community considers legal implications related to privacy 
(and to a lesser extent, data security) as a very important barrier to the use of indoor 
location. Most notably, one of the respondents has highlighted the need to make users 
aware of the impact of LBS on data privacy. 

Again, the extent to which privacy and data security are regarded as a barrier to indoor 
location becomes clear when analyzing the comments provided as free text. Very 
consistently with previous findings, respondents have highlighted how specific national legal 
frameworks (e.g. in France or Romania) may require technology to be adapted to comply 
with local regulations.  

This may include specific requirements according to different business roles (e.g. 
telecommunication operators have different requirements from OTT providers), specific 
restriction to personal data storage (e.g. requirements by French CNIL, the National 
Commission for IT and Freedom) or obligation to ensure informed consent, in order to 
ensure people are aware of how personal data is being used and the associated privacy 
implications. Comments have highlighted how the data subject to legal frameworks and the 
concept itself of “personal information” may change from country to country (e.g. in Romania 
location is regarded as personal information by itself, even if non paired with any other 
personal information), making such legal barriers potentially very complex to handle by LBS 
providers. 

It is important to highlight that the privacy issue has clearly emerged also within this section, 
where respondents were asked to describe their experience (if any) with barriers preventing 
adoption of indoor location, that can be categorized as follows: 

● Difficulty to ensure implementation of privacy laws, which clearly relate with what had 
been highlighted in the previous sections.  

● Need to provide information to reassure people to use location technologies.  
● Need to support removal of personal data whenever the user does not opt in. 

A second barrier, listed by respondents, included Electromagnetic interferences has been 
also perceived as the fourth most relevant barrier. This consistently matched the specific 
mention of radio pollution being a barrier to indoor location, which also emerged from 
additional comments provided by the respondents. In the latter section, a responder 
specifically mentioned their experience where they had been asked to favor non-radio-wave-
based solutions in order to avoid increasing electromagnetic pollution. 

 

Additional note. It is worth noting that the issue of electromagnetic interferences may be 
related to general perception as well as to emerging trends of legal frameworks limiting 
electromagnetic pollution. This is for instance the case of French law n. 2015-136 of 
9/02/15 which forbids electromagnetic pollution from Radio Frequency (RF) emissions 
where there are children less than 3 years of age) as widespread adoption of such legal 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

33 of 84 

frameworks could impact on adoption of RF-based LBS.  

Most notably, widespread adoption of similar legislations could determine an evolution of 
indoor location solutions towards non-RF technologies including computer vision, VLC and 
geo-magnetic technologies. 

 

Data security has also been identified as further barrier to use of indoor location, followed 
then by quality and workflow management procedures and, lastly by a range of different 
minority items including usability of positioning services (indoors and outdoors), lack of 
common frameworks and datasets to evaluate the IPSs, lack of specific services and 
business cases relying on indoor location. 

When asked to “Describe your experience (if any) with barriers preventing adoption of indoor 
location”, the main barriers were highlighted: 1) lack of cross-platform solutions, 2) 
technology barriers and 3) business and financial factors. 

With specific regard to the first item, the lack of cross-OS APIs to support app development 
is regarded as very important barrier, with a specific mention being made for specific lack of 
APIs for iOS systems.  

 

Finding  16. Supplier clearly highlights the importance of developing cross-OS 
APIs. 

 

The second set of barriers covered a range of different technological constraints preventing 
adoption of indoor location, including: 

● The difficulty to identify the right mix of technologies for each specific solution.  
● Need for solutions with better accuracy, shorter latency and longer battery life. 
● Unpractical use of some tag-based solutions in some use cases (tags were reported 

as too big). 
● Different accuracy achieved by different user devices when using mobile centric 

solutions. 
● Instability of RSSI based methods. 
● Difficult implementation and limited security. 
● Need to develop software capable to handle the big data generated by indoor 

location systems. 
 

Finding  17. The survey shows that that 90% of suppliers are working within a 
framework of hybrid location systems, while there is a non-negligible minority that 
is working at single technology approaches. 

 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

34 of 84 

The third, and last, set of barriers instead highlighted business and financial constraints 
including: 

● The difficulty to demonstrate Return on Investment - RoI and Total Cost of 
Ownership - TCO, an essential factor to justify investments, also through 
identification of the right technology mix. 

● High investment costs as well as high investment/performance ratio. 
● Lack of specific business cases, in particular for use of solutions leveraging on 

beacons and VLC. 
● Lack of agreements between carriers to support LBS based on cellular networks. 
● Lack of reliable eco-systems. 
● Administrative issues related to Ambient Assisted Living applications of indoor 

location. 
 

Finding  18. The top benefit expected by far is the improvement of the quality of 
services that not necessarily translates into improved revenues or improved 
savings. The real expected benefit is more intangible and can be described as 
better customer relation when users are customers, but they may well be 
employed, security personnel or maintenance personnel. 

 

8.6 Use	cases	of	interest	
One of the final sections of the survey was meant to elicit a list of explicit use cases and 
scenarios of interest. 

Besides receiving generic responses, such as “real-time positioning” or “indoor navigation 
and guidance”, the participants to the survey have identified a wealth of more specific use 
cases, across several industrial verticals. Many of the reported use cases are truly 
interesting, other are really innovative. Here is the list organized by industry: 

Ambient intelligence: 

● Proximity awareness 
● Distance measurement between to objects / people (e.g. with I.R.) 
● VLC: Use of street lights to distribute information 

Assisted living and ageing people care: 

● Retirement Complex, part of a large chain, with three tier living (for those who are 
able, and for those who need specialized or constant care) could employ indoor 
location services for engaging senior residents, providing health services, 
communication, and coordinating activities, as well as asset tracking and 
Operations/Administration. 

● Analytics of the senior's indoor position in order to monitor daily activities as well as 
alterations in daily lifestyle 

● Object finding, including medicines

● Be able to infer specific postures (e.g. standing, laying on the floor, etc.). 
Building sites: 

● Asset tracking 
Education: 

● Kids safety and behavior monitoring. 
Justice: 

● It is a common practice to put persons suspected of crimes under judicial control. 
This prevents them from leaving some premises, allowing them to continue their life 
at home and possibly also an office. 

Corporate offices: 

● Virtual reception of visitors and guidance to the intended destination. 
● Occupational locating and monitoring of workers, duration of stay and moving 

patterns of people and objects at and between different facilities. 
Facility management: 

● Analytics: usage of spaces (buildings, floors or individual rooms) to develop a 
comprehensive spatial database of the indoor environment. 

● Real time monitoring and allocation of resources. 
● Monitoring the flow of people in indoor spaces 
● Asset tracking 
● Network resource management 
● Security and authentication 

Health care: 

● Locating a patient room within a healthcare infrastructure. 
● Tracking of assets: medical equipment 

Retail: 

● Location determination of people, lighting sensors are expected to provide the 
accuracy lacking with other technologies 

● Locating a product within a retail space. 
● Delivering targeted commercials and content 
● Secure indoor location (position) of point-of-sale (POS) terminals and secure 

proximity of users making payments to that POS terminal. 
Marketing: 

● Location based marketing and advertising 
Safety: 

● Active Shooter: audio sensors that detect a gunshot can be used to detect the 
location of a potential active-shooter incident at public buildings (airports, train 
stations, public administration offices, etc.) using indoor mapping and locating the 
shooter's position in order to begin a threat assessment 

● Imminent seismic forecasting through the analysis of sensors scattered in the 
environment. 

● Personnel tracking

● Geo-fencing 
● Guidance to emergency exits or to safe areas even when the illumination is not 

working or in presence of smoke. 
● Disconnected soldier / firefighter / security agent in emergencies 
● Real-time positioning of first responders in high-rise buildings. 
● Usage of the device sensors to report the presence of smoke. 
● Migrant centers monitoring. The current migrant crisis in Europe often puts refugees 

centers in difficulty monitoring the residents and ensuring safety and security. 
Location and geofencing can improve the safety, especially for women and children 
hosted in the centers. 

● Positioning and collision avoidance of vehicles in underground mines 
Industry: 

● Localization of manufacturing assets 
● Location of objects (e.g. vehicles) within indoor spaces for closed loop process 

control.

Other: 

● Support of people with disabilities 
● Unmanned vehicles, moving robots and flying drones. 
● Augmented reality to improve interface effectiveness 
● Location of best exits for the intended direction. 

This list reports the examples provided by the responders without adding anything, at least 
intentionally. In fact the answers were provided in free text whose interpretation was not 
always straightforward. 

 

Finding  19. The wealth of use cases reported witnesses the huge benefits that 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

37 of 84 

indoor positioning technologies are expected to deliver to a wide range of 
industries. 

  

Finding  20. Different industries have different business goals and business 
processes in place supported by vertically oriented systems. Indoor location 
solutions have to be integrated in such systems and match different performance 
requirements (such as accuracy and availability) according to the requirements of 
the receiving systems. 

  

Additional note. Also the building architecture is typical of the vertical industry. A typical 
factory plant is different from a hospital and from a school. This has an implication also on 
which signals of opportunity can be exploited and which kind of infrastructural investments 
may be needed to support the intended applications with the intended requirements. 

 

8.7 Business	relevance	and	readiness	to	invest	
The questions of this section aimed at assessing the expected benefits from the use of 
indoor location technologies, the perceived maturity and readiness to invest. 

 

Finding  21. Prevailing expectations among Customer organizations are that 
indoor positioning benefits will mainly come from improved customer relations 
(through better service quality) and from improved business processes (mainly 
safety and security). 

 

Therefore, venue owners should consider this investment as an enabler for upgrading 
current systems more than something that has to be justified in isolation. Consequently, the 
location enablers will have to be embedded into the IT systems of the enterprise to enhance 
and extend the capabilities of current services and business processes.

Fig. 14: Services of which respondents would be interested to benefit from 

Most of the interviewed customers respond that their organizations are at least in an 
evaluation phase (not surprising since they responded to this questionnaire) but more 
importantly, they position the investments in the near future (Now). Only a few of them think 
that at least a couple of years are necessary to reach maturity. This means that current 
evaluations and pilots are providing results that justify further steps. 

Integration of the indoor location enablers into current IT environments is not straightforward. 
To complete this process, customer organizations need external support from many actors 
contributing different competences. The most frequently cited are listed below: 

●   App developers to reach the customers and visitors on their mobile device 

●   Consultants to get oriented in this new arena 

●   Location based content providers to deliver the information that the improved 
customer relation will need. 

 

Finding  22. Customer organizations need to be supported in the exploitation of 
indoor location based systems both in terms of consultancy to prepare the 
infrastructure and processes to support the new capabilities and in terms of 
software and content customization. 

8.8 Targeted	verticals	
Most of the use cases listed above sound very general and are not targeting any specific 
verticals. However, features like navigation and geo-fencing, for instance, will support 
different user services and experiences when deployed in a retail context or to a hospital. 
This will affect the available budgets that can be invested, the requirements to be fulfilled

39 of 84 

and the benefits expected from the different players of the value chain. This suggests that 
some industries will be more receptive than others, at least in the first evolutionary stages of 
this market. 

Looking at the responses of customer organizations, we can notice that health care and 
ageing people houses represent the core business of nearly 40% of the respondents. 
Culture, entertainment and other public facilities also account for a remarkable number of 
respondents.. 

These findings are mainly due to the responses collected during the first phase (i.e. 
members of the ILA, OGC and I-locate communities) when 30 out of the 34 customer 
organizations submitted their responses. This result is clearly biased and it is expected that 
many of the respondents to this question came from the i-locate community.  That said, it is 
clear that if the i-locate community grew and consolidated in this vertical, it is because this 
industry is eagerly awaiting solutions, and not only in Europe. 

Looking at responses from the supplier side (see chart), health care is mirroring the previous 
results. Again, the bias highlighted above overestimates the importance of this field. The 
impression is that this is one of the top target industries anyway.  

Second and third ranks responses from the supplier side are the retail and transportation 
industries. This result confirms the interest already highlighted by ILA with its white papers 
[11-12] covering the evolving trends of positioning in these two markets. These industries 
are perceived as the “low hanging” fruits, however, the respondents have clearly indicated 
that potential exploitations span across more than 20 different industries. That is to say that 
the stakeholders they represent do not see limitations intrinsic to the technologies and it is 
only a matter of prioritizing the efforts to target those industries where benefits and spending 
are expected to be higher.

Looking at responses from the supplier side, health care is mirroring the previous results. 
Again, the bias highlighted above overestimates the importance of this field. The impression 
is that this is one of the top target industries anyway.  

Second and third ranks responses from the supplier side are the retail and transportation 
industries. This result confirms the interest already highlighted by ILA with its white papers 
[11-12] covering the evolving trends of positioning in these two markets. These industries 
are perceived as the “low hanging” fruits, however, the respondents have clearly indicated

the stakeholders they represent do not see limitations intrinsic to the technologies and it is 
only a matter of prioritizing the efforts to target those industries where benefits and spending 
are expected to be higher. 

While most of the solutions being deployed appear to be vertical and adapted to the needs 
of a particular industry, nonetheless, there are also opportunities for players targeting venue 
owners with undifferentiated solutions addressing, for instance, security, safety and 
maintenance services. All these businesses are largely independent from the specific 
industry in which the client organization is active and possible adaptations are resolved as 
“service levels” to take into account that the security requirements of a bank are different 
from those of a retailer and the safety requirements in a Nursing Home are different from 
those applicable to a corporate HQ. 

Other respondents offer solutions directly to people. Social networks and marketing 
agencies, for instance, adapt or specialize to target the end customers. In this case social 
networks cannot rely on the venue owner investments to increase accuracy but only on 
crowdsourcing, the device sensors and the signals of opportunity.

Fig. 16: Responses to the question “How important is interoperability to you or to 
your business?” 

8.9 The	role	of	standards	
The last sections of the survey eventually addressed the perceived role of standards within 
the indoor location domain. Very interestingly, when asked how important interoperability is 
to their business, the absolute majority (54.5%) of respondents have declared that it is “very 
important”, followed by an additional 27.6% of respondents regarding interoperability as 
“important”. Perhaps equally interesting, only 2.4% of respondents have considered 
interoperability as “non-important”. 

 

Finding  23. Interoperability is regarded as extremely important to the business of 
the respondent. 

 

When asking more specific questions about the perceived level of interoperability in the 
indoor location domain, the responses shows that the current level of interoperability is not 
perceived as adequate, with 32.8% of respondents considering is as not adequate and 
19.8% considering it as “poor”. Symmetrically only 7.8% and 2.6% of the respondents 
considered interoperability in the indoor location domain respectively “good” and “very good”. 

The analysis of response, also shows a very significant number of people, in fact the relative 
majority of them (37.1%), not being able to formulate a clear response. 

 

Finding  24. The overall perception is that level of interoperability available today 
in the indoor location domain is not adequate.

Additional note. These figures are consistent with previous sections of this survey where 
lack of standards was reported among the most important barriers to development of 
indoor location solutions.  

 

 

Fig. 17: The perceived level of interoperability available today in the indoor location 
domain (from 1 = poor to 5 = very good) 

Previous results are further emphasized if analyzing the importance that has been given to 
interoperability in indoor location. In fact, the vast majority of respondents (52.5%) have 
declared that interoperability is “very important” to indoor location, followed by 33.3% of the 
respondents considering it “important” and with only 1.7% considering it negligible. 

 

Finding  25. Responses from the survey clearly show that interoperability within 
indoor location domain as essential.

Fig. 18: The perceived level of importance of interoperability within the indoor 
location domain (from 1 = negligible to 5 = very important) 

The following question aimed at assessing the familiarity of the sample with specific 
standards in the domain of indoor location. The three most popular standardization initiatives 
are, in order, OGC IndoorGML, OMA MLS and ISO/IEC 24730, with IndoorGML scoring 
three times more than the second.  

 

Additional note. This result may have been biased by the large participation of 
members from the OGC and i-locate community, the latter being aware of i-locate being 
the first implementation of IndoorGML. 

 

 

Fig. 19: The top most known standardization initiatives in the indoor location domain 

When asked to list other relevant standards, the responses have included: 

● ARTS 
● none (2) 
● cityGML (2) 
● BIM 
● IFC 
● OGC OpenLS 
● OGC Moving Objects

● GDF 
● Wi-Fi Direct 
● IEEE 802.11mc  

The last, most technical question within this section of the survey, asked at which level 
interoperability, from low-level (hardware) to high-level (application), would be most 
beneficial. Results have been oriented towards the medium to high level as clearly illustrated 
in the chart below. This further highlights the fact that service-level and application-level 
interoperability (of highest importance for clients and suppliers) are perceived as most 
relevant. 

 

Fig. 20: Results of the question “At which level interoperability would be most 
beneficial?” 

8.10 	A	sample	of	emerging	use	cases	and	scenario	of	interest	
The use-cases and scenarios of interest collected from the respondents are classified into 
the following groups: 

Navigation 
1. Navigation to a place or to meet a buddy (moving destination). 
2. Navigation of UAV or Robot: collision detection of UAV. 
3. Navigation with reduced mobility or visual disability. 

Tracking and Monitoring 
1. Asset tracking. 
2. Indoor facility management. 
3. Monitoring visitors or aged persons for emergency services. 
4. Geo-fencing. 

Indoor analysis 
1. Indoor context analysis. 
2. Trajectory analysis: e.g. moving pattern analysis. 
3. Sensor analysis: seismic sensors or gun shoot audio recognition. 

Context based interaction 
1. Context based content delivery (e.g. coupons or AR info in museum). 
2. Dynamical resource management (e.g. parking lots or the nearest available meeting 

room).

It is evident that all the use-cases and scenarios above require indoor maps but in different 
purposes. For example, the use-case for navigation normally needs indoor maps with 
navigation network, while asset management and monitoring require indoor maps for room 
deployment and semantic information such as classification of rooms (classroom, restroom, 
restaurants, etc.) is also necessary for indoor context analysis. 
 

Additional note. An exemplary Use Case: Indoor navigation map for visually impaired

people.  

An experimental use-case of verbal indoor routing map service, called VIM (Verbal 
Indoor Maps) for visually impaired people has been developed by using TalkBack user-
interface of smartphones with Android OS. Unlike ordinary indoor navigation and map 
services, specific requirements have been considered for this routing map service such 
as such as no additional devices except smartphones, accurate indoor positioning, 
verbal user-interface, environmental information, and walking pattern of visually impaired 
people. Even though it is an experimental service, there are several interesting points in 
this prototype service; 

- Braille block network in indoor space: a navigation network is constructed as an 
application schema IndoorGML where states and transitions in the network are 
defined by considering stop and walk signs of braille blocks and directions. 

- Secondary indoor positioning by Wi-Fi: indoor positioning such as Wi-Fi-based 
indoor positioning serves as a secondary for example to confirm the current 
location. 

- Verbal information attached to transitions: verbal navigation instruction such as “go 
straight 3 meters” is attached to each transition.  

- Landmark information: the information about landmark features is also provided as 
additional instruction of transition. 

- Definition of states and transitions: the movement and behavioral patterns of 
visually impaired people are analyzed for the definition of states and transitions of 
the network.

This service was implemented in a subway station in Seoul. More detail design and 
implementation are found in [18].

9 Findings	from	the	survey	

9.1 Overall	findings		
Although some of the responses of the survey may have partially biased by the different 
communities involved in the survey (OGC, ILA, i-locate), the results, as a whole provide a 
clear picture of the most important requirement emerging from the market.  

In general terms, we can appreciate that there is a strong need for additional standardization 
efforts (de jure or de facto), while current level of interoperability is considered inadequate. In 
fact, lack of standard solutions is regarded by supplier as the most important barrier to 
overcome. At the same time, customer organizations have shown they are well aware that 
the indoor LBSs can be exploited only as a combination of different technologies 
symmetrically, 90% of suppliers has declared they are working within a framework of hybrid 
location systems). 

 Interoperability is regarded as an important driver to minimize costs and ensure lower TOC. 
The importance of interoperable solutions is particular important at higher logical level (i.e. at 
application level), in order to facilitate deployment of solutions leveraging on different 
hardware, different platforms (i.e. operating systems), devices (including different 
smartphones) and their integration within existing business and operational models.  

From a software standpoint, future developments should focus on developing platforms that 
facilitate transparent use of multiple location technologies at once (therefore reducing risks 
from use of a single technology), delivering added value services that can be easily 
integrated with existing IT systems in order to leverage on indoor positioning technology as a 
commodity. Specific request for developments included standardized APIs (including real-
time and cloud APIs) for deployment of cross-OS Apps, for device management, for privacy 
management, device discovery, position data exchange between devices and application 
server (SUPL - Secure User Plane Location), data translations and to access the location 
server, for testing (through test suites). 

At data model level, interoperability should address several aspects, from common naming 
of indoor spaces, to data meaning, or shared data model for location (including RSSI & RTT) 
including easy interaction with BIM systems and with software that allow author indoor data 
in a user-friendly way. 

From a hardware standpoint instead focus should be paid to development of low-latency 
indoor location technologies capable to collect data from passive or very low power device, 
and to the development of solution which are simply to deploy and configure, ideally allowing 
clients to install them autonomously (e.g. through self-configuration means).  

The survey has also clearly depicted the most relevant barriers to widespread use of indoor 
location, the top three (privacy, lack of standardized solutions and limited integration with IT 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

48 of 84 

infrastructures) being shared by both client and supplier organizations albeit with different 
priority. From the survey it clearly emerges that privacy could be regarded, as a whole, as 
the most critical barrier due to its social (in terms of user perception) and legal implications.  

Specific communication actions targeted to making users aware of privacy implications 
should be deployed to reduce mistrust and reluctance to their use.  

From a business standpoint, the survey has still highlighted lack of well-defined use cases 
as well as insufficient proof of true RoI. Most interestingly, client organization have declared 
that their top expected benefit is by far the improvement of the quality of services and that 
not necessarily improved revenues or savings. 

9.2 Standardization-related	findings		
The emerging requirements highlight the importance of integrating indoor location data with 
other standards to maximize their use in scenarios such as facility mapping, asset tracking, 
design, operations & maintenance, statistical analytics. From data visualization point of view, 
these respondents have highlighted the need for integration with standards providing map 
visualization services, 3D portrayal, streaming web and mobile visualization. 

Results of the survey, in particular within the sections collecting requirements of indoor 
location, have highlighted the need for ensuring better integration of indoor data within 
existing standards, including: 

● CityGML, the OGC standard providing a “common information model and XML-based 
encoding for the representation, storage, and exchange of virtual 3D city and 
landscape models [...] realized as an open data model is implemented as an 
application schema for the Geography Markup Language 3 (GML3), the extendible 
international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211.” [7]. 

● WMS – Web Mapping Service, the OGC standard that “provides a simple HTTP 
interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed 
geospatial databases” [8]. 

● WFS – Web Feature Service, the OGC standard that “offers direct fine-grained 
access to geographic information at the feature and feature property level” [9]). 

● WPS – Web Processing Service, the OGC standard that “provides rules for 
standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial 
processing services, such as polygon overlay.” [10]. 

● SOS - Sensor Observation Service, the OGC standard which “defines a Web service 
interface which allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as 
representations of observed features” [17]. 

 

Additional note. It is worth noting that, with specific regard to integration with CityGML, 
the existing IndoorGML standard by OGC already allows leveraging on CityGML to model 
3D indoor spaces. In addition the Moving Feature has been also engineered to implicitly 



     
BENEFITS OF INDOOR LOCATION - USE CASE SURVEY OF LESSONS LEARNED AND EXPECTATIONS 

 

49 of 84 

support representation of features moving within indoor spaces. 

 

The survey has specifically mentioned how, integration of indoor location within the 
aforementioned standards, could be beneficial to support applications such as multi facility 
mapping, asset tracking, design, operations and maintenance, to name but a few. In more 
general terms integration of indoor location within mainstream OGC standards has been 
regarded as very important to improve map visualization services (including 2D and 3D 
portrayal), services for streaming data and for mobile visualization purposes, transaction 
services as well as for statistical analytics. 

9.3 Industry-related	findings		
One first key issue to consider in future activities is the clear indication that the market is 
differentiating into a number of vertical industries. The location of people and assets is key to 
enable new opportunities to more effective and efficient operational processes. Venue 
owners will find motivations to invest in their infrastructure if and when they will be able to 
convert this new enabler into something meaningful with respect to their core business. 

A reference architecture will have to be meaningful for all the players of the ecosystem from 
chip manufacturers to venue owners, including facility managers and external companies 
offering security or maintenance services. 

Best practices are expected to emerge and consolidate from current wave of deployments 
that  will impact on how indoor positioning features are going to be exploited, integrated and 
ultimately embedded into the IT systems of the venue owners. 

From this point of view, the focus of standardization has to move to upper levels, where the 
lack of common approaches and best practices makes the exploitation process still prone to 
errors and expensive. 

The InLocation Alliance (ILA) was founded by the mobile industry to accelerate the adoption 
of indoor position solutions that will enhance the mobile experience by opening up new 
opportunities for consumers and venue owners. 

Requirements for standardization (de jure or de facto) are migrating upper in the stack where 
integration costs impact on the adoption decision of venue owners.

10 Conclusions	
The overall feedback received from the survey has been very positive, with several explicit 
appreciations and encouragements for the initiative, showing how the domain addressed 
enjoys significant attention from often-enthusiastic industrial and user communities.  

Among the many different items discussed within this report, certainly a few are worth a 
specific mention, due to their relevance and to the interest generated among the respondent.  

The first is that a clear leading and proactive role must be taken by industry to offer solutions 
capable to provide high protection of personal data. In fact, privacy has emerged as the 
grand challenge to the success of indoor location technologies and legal frameworks related 
to privacy protection, especially in Europe, are regarded as the most prominent barriers to its 
widespread market uptake.  

Most notably, a few very interesting use cases have emerged from the many received, most 
notably those related to facility management, which can be related to number of activities 
that will highly benefit from indoor positioning, and those related to location and support to 
specific user groups, such as elderly people, who could substantially benefit from indoor 
location while carrying on activities of daily life. 

From a technology standpoint instead, possibly driven by increasingly sophisticated use 
cases, two requirements have emerged clearly: delivering good position accuracy and 
maximizing deployment of long lasting location infrastructures that can be used across a 
range of different applications. Results of the survey suggest that the increasing success 
enjoyed by beacons could pave the way to the creation of such a shared infrastructure.  

Last, but certainly not least, the survey has clearly highlighted that interoperability is 
regarded as essential to the success of indoor (and outdoor) location solutions. The need for 
standards emerges clearly in terms of technologies, for promoting widespread use of 
standard solutions, as well as in terms of data formats (e.g. for management of indoor 
mapping data).

Finding  9. To ensure wider support of indoor location data types and functions in OGC and 

OASIS standards 27	
Finding  10. Within client organizations, “privacy” is regarded as the most important barrier to 

indoor location. 28	
Finding  11. Within client organizations, standard products and services are seen as a 

means to reducing risks related to widespread adoption of a new technology and to 
ensuring integration with their IT infrastructure. 29	

Finding  12. Customer organizations are well aware that the indoor LBSs can be exploited 
only as a combination of different technologies cooperating. 30	

Finding  13. Other concerns among customer organizations refer to the level of engagement 
of people in using location-based services, therefore overcoming lack of motivation, 
reluctance or mistrust to technology. 30	

Finding  14. Supplier organizations consider lack of standard indoor positioning technology 
as the most important barrier. 31	

Finding  15. Client and supplier organizations share the same top three barriers although 
with different priority. 31	

Finding  16. Supplier clearly highlights the importance of developing cross-OS APIs. 33	
Finding  17. The survey shows that that 90% of suppliers are working within a framework of 

hybrid location systems, while there is a non-negligible minority that is working at single 
technology approaches. 33	

Finding  18. The top benefit expected by far is the improvement of the quality of services that 
not necessarily translates into improved revenues or improved savings. The real 
expected benefit is more intangible and can be described as better customer relation

when users are customers, but they may well be employed, security personnel or 
maintenance personnel. 34	

Finding  19. The wealth of use cases reported witnesses the huge benefits that indoor 
positioning technologies are expected to deliver to a wide range of industries. 36	

Finding  20. Different industries have different business goals and business processes in 
place supported by vertically oriented systems. Indoor location solutions have to be 
integrated in such systems and match different performance requirements (such as 
accuracy and availability) according to the requirements of the receiving systems. 37	

Finding  21. Prevailing expectations among Customer organizations are that indoor 
positioning benefits will mainly come from improved customer relations (through better 
service quality) and from improved business processes (mainly safety and security). 37	

Finding  22. Customer organizations need to be supported in the exploitation of indoor 
location based systems both in terms of consultancy to prepare the infrastructure and 
processes to support the new capabilities and in terms of software and content 
customization. 38	

Finding  23. Interoperability is regarded as extremely important to the business of the 
respondent. 41	

Finding  24. The overall perception is that level of interoperability available today in the 
indoor location domain is not adequate. 41	

Finding  25. Responses from the survey clearly show that interoperability within indoor 
location domain as essential. 42
