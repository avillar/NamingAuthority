Abstract 
Report: Development of Spatial Data Infrastructures for Marine Data 

Management  

OGC - IHO Marine SDI Concept Development Study (CDS) 

This engineering report presents the results of a concept development study on a 
Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), sponsored by the National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency (NGA) - Maritime Safety Office (MSO), on behalf of the 
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the IHO MSDI Working Group 
(MSDIWG), and executed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The goal of 
this study was to demonstrate to stakeholders the diversity, richness and value of a 
Marine SDI – specifically data, analysis, interoperability and associated IT services 
- including web services - in addressing needs of the marine domain. 

The study included an open Request for Information (RFI) with the objective to 
gather additional information to better support governments, agencies, non-
governmental organizations and citizens, unlocking the full societal and economic 
potential of the wealth of marine data at local, national, regional or international 
levels. The RFI results also provide information and insight on the current state of 
the Marine SDI. In addition to the RFI, a MSDI workshop and roundtable were held 
to gather additional information from both expert panel members and the audience.  

This engineering report presents an analysis of RFI, workshop and roundtable 
responses and interactions which provided in depth information on requirements and 
issues related to stakeholders, architecture, data, standards of current and a possible 
future Marine SDI. In addition, this report will serve as the basis for improvement of 
SDIs’ to support the marine domain. The responses will also be discussed with 
potential sponsoring organizations that would provide funding opportunities for 
possible Marine SDI Pilot(s) initiatives proposed for later this year, and in subsequent 
years. All RFI, workshop and roundtable responses will contribute to Marine SDI(s) 
moving forward. It will help to achieve greater interoperability, availability and 
usability of geospatial Web services and tools across different types of marine spatial 
data uses. In addition, these responses will provide identification of gaps, and

definition of core components of an SDI to be referenced by IHO MSDIWG and used 
to define reference use-cases and scenarios for use in future pilot activities.

Chapter 1 Introduction 

Ocean and marine data are recognized as valuable resources that tend to have a high 
cost of acquisition. Large quantities of this data are collected and stored all over the 
world for a wide variety of purposes and by diverse groups of public and private 
entities. Due to its importance and value, this data should be well managed and made 
as widely available to end users as possible for a variety of uses including planning, 
policy and decision making; marine management; Marine Spatial Planning (MSP); 
scientific research, and economic activities.  

The collection, protection and sharing of marine data provides significant societal 
benefits. Data and information on the state and variability of the marine environment 
is crucial for understanding changes that may result from human activity, including 
the effects of human-induced climate change and ocean acidification. In addition, 
there is an urgent need to develop and provide improved emergency planning and 
response in the world’s sea space. This has been highlighted by several high profile 
events in recent years including:  

● BP oil spill in Gulf of Mexico;  
● 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan;  
● 2014 sinking of MV Sewol in Korea; and  
● the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.  

Reaction to each of these, and numerous other events, requires a multi-disciplinary 
approach including emergency response, environmental protection and longer term 
regional planning.  

Currently government agencies, research institutions, and the private sector provide 
a considerable investment in marine monitoring and observation, data sharing and 
assembly, as well as downstream services. As a result, significant progress has been 
made to collect, aggregate and make publicly available the data and information 
derived from monitoring and observing our marine environment.  

However, data-sharing initiatives still face common challenges in their efforts to 
unlock the full societal and economic potential of the wealth of marine data and 
observations at local, national, regional and international levels. The landscape 
remains highly fragmented and complex and the need for a better integrated, end-to-
end and sustained Marine SDI remains high.  



 

18 

The ability to effectively share, use, and re-use geospatial information and 
applications across, and between, the diverse groups of marine stakeholders is 
dependent upon having an effective Marine SDI already in-place. 

Figure 1.1 below, from Natural Resources Canada, presents an example that shows 
the key aspects of an SDI. It illustrates common aspects of SDIs that are also 
applicable to the marine domain. 

 
Figure 1.1: Aspects of an SDI (Source:  Natural Resources Canada) 

This report discusses the various classes and types of stakeholders of a Marine SDI 
examining their specific needs (chapter 2) and then looks into currently used and 
emerging standards within the marine domain (chapter 3). The report then explores 
marine data themes and ontologies within a SDI (chapter 4) and discusses possible 
SDI architecture models, data, standards and interoperability including aspects to 
optimize discovery, usage, and processing of data in a highly heterogeneous network 
of SDI data and service providers (chapter 5). This then leads to an interoperability 
reference architecture based on RFI responses (chapter 6).  The report finally 
discusses technologies, portals and scenarios (chapter 7). The report concludes with 
a discussion of other factors received from the RFI responses, workshop and round-
table that may be considered when building an effective Marine SDI  (chapter 8). 
Finally, conclusions from the report are summarized.

1.1 Goals, Sponsor, and Participants of this 
Initiative 

The ability to effectively share, use, and re-use geospatial information and 
applications across and between public and private sector organizations in support of 
the marine domain is dependent upon having an effective SDI already in-place. This 
CDS, and possible resulting pilots, are expected to assess the current state of data and 
product exchange practices and technologies as used in the marine domain. The 
information gained in the CDS will aid in developing a series of possible future pilots 
that may, in turn, advance the state of SDIs that support effective marine data usage 
across the globe. The CDS project brought together diverse stakeholders from the 
global marine community to assess the current state of SDI components. The study 
documented data interoperability technologies and standards, developed an inventory 
of available geospatial Web services across different marine sub-domains, defined 
the core components of a Marine SDI architecture, and presented conclusions that 
may be implemented in future Marine SDI pilot(s).  

This engineering report provides an analysis of RFI, workshop and round-table 
responses from marine domain stakeholders and contributors. In addition to the 
analysis contained within the report, a detailed agenda and key points taken away 
from both the workshop and roundtable are provided in Appendix C. Future Pilot(s), 
if activated, will be organized and executed by OGC’s Innovation Program as a 
structured initiative with active involvement by several OGC members and 
potentially larger, partner organizations (e.g., IHO).  

Organization managing the CDS 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international consortium of more than 
500 companies, government agencies, research organizations, and universities 
participating in a consensus process to develop publicly available geospatial 
standards. OGC standards support interoperable solutions that "geo-enable" the Web, 
wireless and location-based services, and mainstream IT. OGC standards empower 
technology developers to make geospatial information and services accessible and 
useful with any application that needs to be geospatially enabled. 

Partner Organizations 



 

20 

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is an intergovernmental 
consultative and technical organization that was established in 1921 to support safety 
of navigation and the protection of the marine environment. 

The object of the Organization is to bring about: 

● The coordination of the activities of national hydrographic offices; 

● The greatest possible uniformity in nautical charts and documents; 

● The adoption of reliable and efficient methods of carrying out and exploiting 
hydrographic surveys; and 

● The development of the sciences in the field of hydrography and the 
techniques employed in descriptive oceanography. 

In 2016, both IHO and OGC entered in to a formal Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU). Two of their subordinate working groups have been closely collaborating for 
a number of years: the IHO MSDI Working Group (MSDIWG) and the OGC Marine 
Domain Working Group (Marine DWG). 

The IHO MSDIWG is established within the IHO’s Inter-Regional Coordination 
Committee (IRCC) and supports the activities of the IHO related to Spatial Data 
Infrastructures (SDI) and/or Marine Spatial Data Infrastructures (MSDI). During its 
annual meeting. In 2017, the MSDIWG discussed the possibility to create a structured 
OGC study that could establish the framework for future development of MSDI. In 
2018, NGA, representing the United States alongside NOAA in the MSDIWG, began 
support of the Marine SDI CDS on behalf of the MSDIWG and its work program 
tasks. 

The OGC Marine DWG is motivated by the widening use of marine data for purposes 
other than safe navigation, which can be captured loosely under the term MSDI. The 
Marine DWG also ensures that evolving IHO standards (e.g., S-100) are brought to 
the attention of the OGC members and evolving OGC standards are brought to the 
attention of IHO members in an effort to ensure best practices are being used and the 
latest technical approaches considered. The Marine DWG works closely with the IHO 
MSDIWG and its adjacent groups/commissions/committees under the IHO IRCC, the 
IHO Hydrographic Services and Standards Committee (HSSC), and other related 
organizations. The Marine DWG has been an active participant and champion of this 



 

21 

Marine SDI CDS activity and has assisted the MSDIWG with furthering this activity 
through OGC. 

This Marine SDI CDS activity furthers the collaboration and common interests of 
IHO and OGC, established in their MoU, and contributes to the development of a 
foundational report for the development of MSDIs worldwide.

relevant, accurate and actionable GEOINT. NGA enables the U.S. intelligence 
community and the Department of Defense (DOD) to fulfill the president’s national 
security priorities to protect the nation. NGA also anticipates its partners’ future needs 
and advances the GEOINT discipline to meet them. 

1.2 Marine SDI CDS Activity 

The Marine SDI Concept Development Study was sponsored by NGA on behalf of 
the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the IHO Marine SDI 
Working Group (MSDIWG), a primary organization involved in this study. Kicked-
off on July 7, 2018, the goal was to demonstrate the diversity, richness and value of 
Marine Web services to marine stakeholders. The diversity of data available via OGC 
specifications was assessed within the context of domestic, regional/multi-national 
and international requirements. 

The project is being executed in two phases. The first phase was organized as an 
OGC concept development study. The second phase, if initiated, will be an OGC 
pilot initiative with active involvement of a number of OGC member organizations. 
Funding and sponsorship is required for the pilot phase. 
 
Both the OGC Concept Development Study and Pilot are conducted in accordance 
with the OGC Interoperability Program Policy and Procedures. Phase one develops 
an overall assessment of geospatial Web services across the marine domain, defines 
the core components of the National SDI architecture for marine environment 
(Marine SDI), and define use cases and scenarios for future implementations as part 



 

22 

of Phase two. These activities are complemented by the request for information (RFI) 
and workshops in order to capture the various perspectives, requirements, and 
opinions by marine stakeholders and contributors.  

The goal of future pilot activities is to articulate the value of interoperability and to 
demonstrate the usefulness of standards. This will be done by implementing the 
recommended Marine SDI architecture and developing demonstrations that will tell 
the story of the scenario(s) and showcase incorporation of the services into Marine 
SDI and other applications.  

Several ways identified during the Concept Development Study that a future pilot(s) 
can support MSDI enhancements are:  

● Gathering requirements on different portions of a common SDI architecture 
to support the marine domain.; 

● Explaining an SDI architecture concept, technology and its application to 
support marine domain stakeholders; 

● Making more data available; 

● Analyzing consistent and long term retainability practices for marine domain 
material; and 

● Complementing it with clients, tools, and applications that allow efficient use 
of Marine SDI data, processing resources and long-term storage capabilities. 

1.3 Profile and Role of RFI Responses 

The Marine SDI RFI consisted of a set of questions divided into 8 clusters. These 8 
clusters were: 

1. Stakeholders 
2. Architecture and Data Governance Models  
3. Data 
4. Requirements 
5. Scenarios and Use Cases 
6. Operation & Organization 
7. Technologies & Applications 
8. Other Factors 



 

23 

Respondents were invited to answer any or all questions and take as much space as 
they felt required to provide a thorough response.  

1.3.1 Profile of RFI Respondents 

A total of 27 responses to the RFI were received representing contributions from 11 
different countries. As Figure 1.2 shows, over two thirds of the responses (72%) were 
a coordinated response from single institutions/companies (spanning national 
institutes, agencies, private companies and other single entities); 20% from ‘umbrella’ 
organizations or projects (from people working in the marine and maritime sectors) 
and 8% were individual responses. 

 
Figure 1.2: Profile of RFI Respondents  (Source: OGC) 

 

Figure 1.3 shows that most of the respondents replied that their organization was 
scientific or environmentally based (44%), including private and public research 
performers, such as universities, research institutes, and agencies. Contributions from 
hydrographic offices represented 30% while 26% were received from commercial 
organizations. 



 

24 

 
Figure 1.3: Organization Type of RFI Respondents (Source: OGC) 

These results represent a fairly even distribution of responses across different 
organization types. 

1.3.2 Role of RFI Respondents 

There were three polar (yes/no) questions about the role of the respondent or their 
organization. The first question determines whether the respondent was a data 
provider and/or data owner (e.g. data, tools, applications, services). The next question 
determined if the respondent was primarily a marine data user (e.g., science, research, 
commercial) and finally the third question determined if the respondent was a data 
enabler (e.g., help provide access to the data, software company, data standards 
organization, app developer).  

As shown in figure 1.4, over three quarters (78%), of those that responded to the 
question, indicated they were a marine data provider or owner while less then one 
quarter (22%), of those that responded to the question, indicated that they were marine 
data users. However, almost all respondents (96%) indicated that they considered 
themselves data enablers.  



 

25 

 
Figure 1.4: Role of RFI Respondents  (Source: OGC) 

These results indicate that respondents either considered themselves to be marine data 
providers or marine data users but not both. There are very few overlapping 
stakeholders with regards to producers and users of data within the marine domain.

Chapter 2: MSDI Definition and Stakeholders 

This chapter looks at the definition of a Marine SDI and examines the four traditional 
SDI pillars as they relate to the marine domain. Once this definition has been 
established, the chapter will examine and analyze the various levels of stakeholders 
and how they interact. This will aid in determining their needs and requirements as 
they relate to a Marine SDI.     

2.1 What is a Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure? 

A definition by the International Hydrographic Organization provides a succinct 
interpretation:  

“A Marine SDI is the component of an SDI that encompasses marine and 
coastal geographic and business information in its widest sense and would 
typically include information on seabed bathymetry (elevation), geology, 
infrastructure (e.g. wrecks, offshore installations, pipelines, cables); 
administrative and legal boundaries, areas of conservation and marine 
habitats and oceanography.''2  

A Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure (MSDI) is that element of an SDI that 
focuses on the marine input in terms of governance, standards, ICT and 
content. The concept of MSDI is now gaining wider appreciation in terms 
of the way a variety of data types might be combined for efficient analysis 
by a wide range of disciplines, such as spatial planning, environmental 
management and emergency response. This requires the data to be held in 
a generic way, rather than for a particular product for a limited user group 
or for a specific purpose. An MSDI is not a collection of hydrographic 
products, but an infrastructure that promote interoperability of data at all 
levels.

for Hydrographic Offices, Edition 2.0.0, January 2017 



 

27 

The four basic components, or pillars, of a Marine SDI are shown in the following 
diagram: 

 

Figure 2.1. Four Pillars of an MSDI (Source: IHO Publication C-17, Spatial Data 
Infrastructures: “The Marine Dimension”) 

These pillars are defined as follows. 

1. Data and Metadata - comprise the marine data and information to be made 
accessible. 

2. Information System/Technology - encompasses the hardware, software and 
system component. 

3. Standards - which emphasizes the “unlocking” of geospatial data. This is 
usually accomplished through enablers. 

4. Policy and Governance - which dictates the structural relationships of all 
those involved. 

As was described in the MSDI Workshop, the MSDI includes all aspects related to 
spatial information including the structure of the data and all of the interfaces to 
the systems that disseminate or present the information. At a more granular level, 
these fundamental components can include: 

● Data structure/schema (Application Schema); 
● Data description/semantics (Feature Catalogue); 
● Metadata; 
● Data and metadata capture operations; 



 

28 

● Data (the data elements); 
● Data management; 
● Discovery; 
● Access; and 
● Transformation. 

Based on RFI responses and MSDI Workshop discussions, there appears to be several 
challenges in engaging a Marine SDI, as follows. 

● Lack of an integrated policy and operational framework to facilitate rapid 
acceptance, qualification, ingest and use of relevant geospatial information 
from a range of government, commercial providers and citizens.  

● The current focus on products supporting a single customer group such as 
those of Hydrographic Offices. Without diminishing their relevance and 
importance, their traditional business model may not be compatible with 
MSDI principles of data sharing and collaboration, due to the critical nature 
of chart production and Safety of Navigation (SoN). 

● Inability, with existing metadata approaches, to quickly discover and 
understand which information sources are most useful in the context of a 
user’s need.  

● Inability to properly fuse and synthesize multiple data sources.  

● The need for a persistent platform to organize and manage marine information 
and tools necessary for collaborating organizations to fully utilize the variety 
of marine data. 

A goal of this CDS was to determine the current state of these challenges. 

2.2 Marine SDI Stakeholders 

The number and types of stakeholders is evolving with the changing marine 
domain environment. As an example, increased vessel traffic above the Arctic 
Circle, increased surveying and research work, increased resource exploration and 
extraction work, or increased tourism among other things are significant 
contributors to these changes. With increasing human activity, chances of disasters 



 

29 

and emergencies also increase, making emergency response organizations a key 
user group of a Marine SDI.  

The responses from the RFI, workshop and roundtable have differentiated the 
range of stakeholders into five classes. The stakeholders summarized under each 
class often have some influence on each other, illustrated by the circular arrows. 

 
Figure 2.2: Classes of Stakeholders 

Using Figure 2.2 and beginning in the upper left, the wide class of end-users 
includes all consumers of products provided by the other classes, e.g., data and 
services, products in the form of reports and statistics, policies and regulations etc. 
Following the arrows clockwise, the next class aggregates all data producers or 
creators, data providers, data brokers, and value-added resellers. This large group 
is of particular relevance, as it is responsible for one of the main products of the 
Marine SDI, the data. The third class covers data processors such as GIS 
professionals, data scientists, data modelers, mapping experts, or others in the high 
end supercomputing environment who are addressing the complexity of near or 
real-time analytics / forecasting geospatial products. These experts create products 
such as analyses, reports, statistics, or maps using data provided by the previous 
group. The fourth class, data handlers, somewhat intersects the previous three, and 
includes the hardware, storage and computing service providers that provide the 
necessary infrastructure for data exchange and processing. The last class, Policy 



 

30 

makers, tends to intersect the classes described before. It lays out the necessary 
rules and guidelines for a successful operation and governance of Marine SDIs.  

Identified stakeholders from RFI responses classified in one or many of these five 
levels come from a wide range of organizations. An already long, though still non-
exclusive, list is provided in table 2.1.

the Engineering Report continue to welcome the involvement and contributions of 
anyone involved in marine data management willing to support the goals and 
objectives of a future pilot.

2.3 Needs of Stakeholders 

Though the stakeholders vary considerably, there are substantial overlap in terms 
of needs among most stakeholders. Generally speaking, needs for the data 
consumers or end users, include the aspects of easy discovery, access, download 
and analysis of marine spatial data. For the data producer, provider and processor, 
needs include the ability to publish, integrate, aggregate and analyze geospatial 
data and related non-geospatial data. Focus should be on ease-of-use and 
effectiveness. Integrated systems, possibly in a system-of-systems or network-of-
networks approach, with the ability to harvest data from existing solutions in a 
secure, reliable manner, should be supported. 

In addition, there is a need for further requirements on real-time or archived 
availability, data and system Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), reuse and 
indemnification rules and regulations, security and privacy settings, as well as 
financial costs. 

On the system side, it is essential that systems are operational and reliable with 
clear life cycle costs to providers and users. Stakeholders require robust, but 
intuitive, easy-to-use tools, to access, visualize and contribute data in a manner that 
allows for ingestion into organizations supporting policy development and decision 
making. The underlying systems have to cater to various types of consumer 
capacities. While some of the stakeholders may have very limited internal 
geospatial capacity or solutions, others are far more advanced. 

In terms of data sets, a detailed analysis of both provided and required data sets are 
discussed in chapter 5.  

From an analysis of the RFI responses, and information discussed and presented at 
the workshop and roundtable, the stakeholder needs relevant to a Marine SDI can 
be distilled and summarized as follows. 

1. The Marine SDI should foster data integrity and provide stakeholders with 
security-based, appropriate access to the spatial data they need.  These data 
can be static as well as dynamic.  

2. The Marine SDI should allow access of data on a variety of devices and 
platforms including mobile, e.g., smartphones and tablets. 



 

33 

3. The Marine SDI should allow different stakeholders, at different locations, to 
access the SDI. 

4. The Marine SDI should allow for data exchange, especially the dynamic data, 
in an interoperable, appropriate, efficient and secure way. 

These four overarching needs are a simplification of the wide variety of needs 
facing stakeholders. However, keeping these four requirements top-of-mind during 
implementation will lead to a more effective, sustainable, useful and dynamic 
Marine SDI for all stakeholders.  

Table 2.2 illustrates the interlocking of marine theme, stakeholder and 
data/applications. Even though the table represents a small subset of the themes, 
stakeholders, and applications, the table still provides a valuable insight into the 
richness of applications in the marine domain. The table does not provide an 
exhaustive list of data and all its possible applications.

Table 2.2: Application Requirements Across Stakeholders and Marine Themes 

The challenge is to manage both the data/analytic contributions, and the 
data/analytical needs of the many marine domain organizations, during the present 
period, when an overload of new data is pouring into the marine community on a 
regular basis. Preparedness and planning phases are critical to make management 
and ease of access to the data a reality. The computer and telecommunications 
infrastructure must be designed to scale up in order to handle the ever increasing 
demands for data and analysis of the data. 

From the Marine SDI CDS RFI responses there was a unanimous “Yes” to the 
question, “Are there unique needs that need to be considered at various levels of 
marine operations (local, state, regional, national, international levels), and by various 
players (government, commercial, NGO, academia/research)?” It is apparent that the 
marine domain has unique requirements.  

The engagement of stakeholders and the awareness raising of the Marine SDI 
among potential stakeholders are key goals of the Marine SDI CDS. First and 
foremost, the best way to get stakeholders involved and well served is to meet their 



 

36 

needs. This requires making data easy to find, use, and understand. During the 
Marine SDI Workshop the following three simple questions directly targeted the 
usefulness of any Marine SDI. 

1. Can I find it? - Can an individual or organization find the data and 
information they are looking for (highly metadata dependent). The better 
the metadata usually the easier it is to discover the data that meets user 
requirements. 

2. Can I get it? - Once discovered, can the data actually be accessed or 
retrieved. Are there ways to easily download or access the data. 

3. Can I use it? - The data is accessible but is it in a format that can be used. 

For any Marine SDI to be considered successful, then ‘yes’ must be the answer to 
these questions. The more we dive into these three simple questions the more 
complex things tend to get. It must also be kept in mind that a particular Marine 
SDI does not have to provide everything to everyone. 

This report reflects guidelines and experiences from a significant number of marine 
domain and data management experts to identify the best way to achieve these 
essential requirements. In addition, ease of use, reliability, and completeness, are 
further dimensions that can be actively pursued. The following subsection 
identifies aspects that need to be addressed in order to improve the participation 
and integration of stakeholders. 

2.3.1 Integration and Presentation 

Another aspect that needs to be investigated is the integration of a Marine SDI with 
existing regional and National Spatial Data Infrastructures (NSDI), such as the U.S. 
NSDI advanced by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC). Further 
attention shall be given to the integration of marine data and apps (applications that 
use the data) into widely deployed and used platforms. This is in addition to any 
stand-alone Marine SDI Portals. Simply put, some stakeholders are better served 
by integrating data and apps into the tools they use. For geospatial scientists, it 
means being tightly integrated into their GIS; for policy stakeholders, it would 
mean simple story maps, creating dashboard using marine statistical and geospatial 
data tied to policy questions; and for scientists, it would mean integration of marine 
datasets with analytical tools. Additionally, stand-alone Marine Portals must be 
designed for ease of use, must be interoperable with each other, and be both reliably 
available and secure. To achieve this level of integration, standards defining 



 

37 

generic data containers or Web service interfaces for easy data access are of overall 
importance. 

2.4  Coordination and Communications 

Coordination of SDI related activities and collaboration among the various 
organizations involved is a critical success factor for a Marine SDI. A successfully 
shared SDI would be a stepping stone to other collaboration activities that could focus 
on increased data collection, introduction of robust monitoring programs, and ideally 
reduced duplication of effort. Additional coordinating activities include fostering 
early coordination and planning, encouraging transparency within the public sector 
so that collection priorities and data requirements are clearly stated and that the most 
efficient approach can be applied to ensure end user needs are met. In particular, the 
following aspects shall be considered. 

● Work closely with marine, oceanographic and hydrographic organizations 
such as the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), that supports the 
development of MSDIs and through its MSDI Working Group (MSDIWG), 
aims to identify and promote national and regional best practices, assesses 
existing and new standards in the provision of marine components of spatial 
data infrastructures, promotes MSDI training and education, and facilitates 
(external) MSDI communication. 

● Involve the Government Agencies at all levels of the marine domain. 

● Integrate multiple technologies during offshore data collection to speed the 
pace of acquisition, increase safety, and benefit multiple stakeholders with a 
variety of datasets meeting a varied level of needs. 

2.4.1 Outreach and Awareness 

Outreach and awareness activities help attract new stakeholders and raise 
awareness of the importance of MSDI among stakeholders already involved or at 
least aware of the relevance of a MSDI. Combined with early coordination 
activities, outreach and awareness activities across stakeholders help to maximize 
efficiency and transparency, which are crucial components leading to acceptance 
and eventual success of a MSDI. From the RFI responses, workshop, and 
roundtable discussions, the following activities and mechanisms are suggested. 



 

38 

● Outreach, including the utilization of social media, story maps, press 
releases, conference presentations, websites, online and in-classroom 
training classes, books, etc. All of the above are important for an SDI 
community to thrive.  

● Promote the idea of crowd-sourced data. 

● Consider developing a White Paper for discussion and comment at both 
ministerial and senior management level across all stakeholders. 

● Publicize projects to help make the average citizen care more about the 
marine domain and its global impact. 

● Improve collaboration between the public and private sectors to share 
lessons learned, establish best practices, and keep abreast of technology 
advancements. 

● Participate in the marine related trade shows, symposiums, and 
conferences. 

● Share Case Studies to demonstrate the wide range of uses of Marine Spatial 
Data. 

Technology ease of use, coupled with reliability, greatly impacts stakeholder 
adoption rates as well as ensuring users are successful. Thus, the best outreach is 
probably achieved by word of mouth, triggered by an excellent implementation of 
a MSDI serving all stakeholders needs. Another approach to improve outreach is 
to implement it embedded in the exchange technologies. In this case, outreach 
material is shipped with software or directly part of Web portals. Further on, 
outreach embedded in technology can provide a base set of data in tools out-of-
the-box without requiring substantial download of data at start-up time; an 
approach that simplifies the usage of software components. 

It is a goal of a future pilot to demonstrate the value of MSDI to stakeholders through 
the use of multiple case studies that would demonstrate the capabilities of MSDI. This 
case study demonstration would overcome the currently existing paradox: potential 
stakeholders are not aware of the capabilities of a MSDI and therefore not using it; 
meanwhile, the data providers are not able to adapt to the users’ needs, as they are 
neither formulated nor expressed.

Chapter 3: Currently Used and Emerging Standards 

The value of standards is clearly demonstrable and is one of the key pillars of any 
SDI including a Marine SDI. The OGC defines an open standard as having the 
following characteristics. 

1. Is created in an open, international, participatory industry process. The 
standard is thus non-proprietary, that is, owned in common. It will continue 
to be revised in that open process, in which any company, agency or 
organization can participate. 

2. Has free rights of distribution: An "open" license shall not restrict any party 
from selling or giving away the specification as part of a software distribution. 
The "open" license shall not require a royalty or other fee. 

3. Has open specification access: An "open" environment must include free, 
public, and open access to all interface specifications. Developers are allowed 
to distribute the specifications. 

4. Does not discriminate against persons or groups: "Open" specification 
licenses must not discriminate against any person or group of persons. 

5. Ensures that the specification and the license must be technology neutral: 
No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology 
or style of interface. 

Open standards are key for the quality and development of interoperable geographic 
information and geospatial software during the entire life cycle of any data set. 
Standards define how data is created, archived, used, discovered and exchanged 
between components within a system. They address different aspects of 
interoperability such as syntax, semantics, services, profiles, or cultural and 
organizational interoperability. There are excellent publications which discuss the 
value of standards and the role of standards in geospatial information management 
(OGC/ISO TC211/IHO, 2014) or the usage of standards within SDIs (United Nations, 
2013). This report focuses on the experiences of the SDI developers and users 
community along with input from RFI responders, workshop attendees and 
roundtable participants gathered during the course of the project. It will also refer to 
external literature for further details on the various standards. A good starting point 
to learn more about existing standards relevant to the marine domain is the website 



 

40 

of the International Organization for Standardization, the Open Geospatial 
Consortium and the International Hydrographic Organization. 

An approach often used by various SDI cookbooks that exist for the development and 
operation of an SDI (New Zealand Geospatial Office, 2011; United Nations, 2013) 
appears to be quite suitable here. This approach classifies standards, in the context of 
an SDI, into three categories. 

● Content Standards - For understanding the contents of different data themes 
by providing a data model of spatial features, attributes, relationships, and a 
data dictionary. 

● Management Standards - For handling spatial data involving actions such 
as discovery of data through metadata, spatial referencing of data, collection 
of data from the field, submission of data by contractors to stakeholders, and 
tiling of image-based maps. 

● Portrayal Standards - For structured visual portrayal of spatial data. 

The following sections will briefly discuss more details on the various categories to 
ensure a robust baseline for the development of a MSDI reference architecture as 
discussed in chapter 6. 

3.1 Existing Standards and Organizations 

One approach, to understanding the status of MSDI implementations, is to 
characterize the development of their individual technology and standards elements. 
RFI Responses described four primary standards bodies, the International 
Hydrographic Organization (IHO), International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO), the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the World Wide Web 
Consortium (W3C). It should be noted that these organizations do not work in 
isolation and significant efforts are underway to better integrate OGC and IHO 
activities and increase dialog with ISO and W3C, especially within the marine 
domain. 

Standards and Interoperability address mechanisms and agreements to ensure that 
components which are part of, or that are loosely connected to, an MSDI can 
communicate with each other. The following underlying principles govern the 
implementation of standards within an MSDI. 



 

41 

• Interoperability of SDI components across platforms is of overall importance. 

• Data shall be served at standardized Web interfaces using standardized 
encodings. 

• Standards-based Web GIS integrates and leverages all the investments that 
have already been made in GIS standards, data, and technologies. Any MSDI 
should benefit from these investments and should be based on Web GIS 
patterns. 

• Detailed compliance tests shall be available to ensure interoperability across 
components. 

3.1.1 International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) 

The IHO is a domain specific standards organization. It is a high level international 
intergovernmental organization, often represented by their national hydrographic 
offices, from which a significant portion of the RFI responses were provided. The 
IHO initially developed unique stand-alone standards, such as the IHO Transfer 
Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data S-57, but is in the process of replacing these 
standards with standards based on the ISO Geographic information/Geomatics 
standards (i.e., ISO/TC 211). The transition to the new IHO Universal Hydrographic 
Data Model (S-100) is in progress, and much of hydrographic data currently in use is 
built to S-57 and is therefore only partially suitable for use with many of the Web 
Services standards available from ISO and OGC.  

The IHO has published the Universal Hydrographic Data Model - S-100 standard 
which “will use and extend the ISO 19100 series of geographic standards for 
hydrographic, maritime and related issues.”  Still in development, the S-101 
Electronic Nautical Chart (ENC) product specification, is based on the S-100 
framework and is aimed at replacing the existing IHO S-57 standard. Standards to 
support state discharge of International Maritime Organization (IMO) obligations 
under the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) convention are a priority for IHO members 
and standards for ENC (S-57 and, in time, S-101) are endorsed and used by the IMO 
community to provide type approved data and marine navigational equipment. 
Alongside SOLAS-specific requirements the IHO community promotes MSDI 
through its MSDI Working Group (MSDIWG). and activities in Regional 
Hydrographic Commissions (RHCs). IHO S-100 is fully capable of supporting MSDI 
activities and standards as well as those serving SOLAS needs. 



 

42 

The IHO has already published or is developing several other product specifications 
based on S-100. This includes, but not limited to, IHO S-102 Bathymetric Surface 
Product Specification, S-111 Surface Current Product Specification, S-121 Maritime 
Limits and Boundaries, S-122 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and several others.  

The IHO standards are in alignment with the ISO and OGC standards necessary to 
establish a Spatial Data Infrastructure, but some of the IHO standards are not yet 
implemented on a broad scale.  

3.1.2 International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee on 
Geographic Information TC211 has developed a large repertoire of standards to 
describe many aspects of geographic information. A number of its standards are 
abstract high level reference models and abstract schemas. The ISO standards are 
intended to be guides upon which other groups, such as IHO or national bodies or 
industry would develop more specific profiles and product specifications.  

The ISO standards are widely adopted and many of the standards are of great 
importance such as the general feature model, metadata, spatial referencing, spatial 
schema, coverage geometry and register standards. They already form the basis of the 
IHO S-100 standard.  

The ISO standards also support services and define encodings that are used in a Web 
Service. The “neutral” encoding defined in ISO is XML and the namespace for 
geographic information in XML is the Geography Markup Language (GML) an XML 
grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). GML has also been 
defined in ISO as standard ISO 19136 Geographic information -- Geography Markup 
Language (GML).  Both ISO and OGC also define standards for other aspects of Web 
Services. 

The ISO standards are mature and support the development of an MSDI; but to use 
them, profiles and product specifications need to be developed. 

3.1.3 The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an industry standards group that primarily 
develops service standards that support Web Services. They work closely with ISO 
and provide the implementation level standards that are used in services.  The OGC 



 

43 

have a wide repertoire of standards, and their standards evolved quickly to keep-up 
with technology. 

OGC has defined a set of services and compliance tests that essentially make-up the 
interface to a Spatial Data Infrastructure. This is a hierarchical structure. 

OGC standards are in place and sufficient to implement a full suite of Web Services, 
although the standards are fluid and are in active development. A Web Service is not 
something one just builds and lets stand. It needs active maintenance and evolution. 

3.1.3.1 OGC Standards in Marine Use 

Current OGC Standards used in marine community include the following. 

● Observations & Measurements (O&M) – The general models and XML 
encodings for observations and measurements. 

● PUCK Protocol Standard – Defines a protocol to retrieve a SensorML 
description, sensor "driver" code, and other information from the device itself, 
thus enabling automatic sensor installation, configuration and operation. 

● Web Map Service (WMS) - It provides a simple HTTP interface for requesting 
geo-registered map images from one or more distributed geospatial databases. 

● Web Feature Service (WFS) - It provides an interface allowing requests for 
geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls.  

● Web Coverage Service (WCS) - It defines Web-based retrieval of multi-
dimensional coverages – that is, digital geospatial information representing 
space/time-varying phenomena. 

● Catalogue Service - It supports the ability to publish and search collections of 
descriptive information (metadata) for data, services, and related information 
objects and present results for evaluation and further processing by both 
humans and software. 

● Sensor Model Language (SensorML) – Standard models and XML Schema 
for describing the processes within sensor and observation processing 
systems. 



 

44 

● Sensor Observation Service (SOS) – Open interface for a web service to obtain 
observations and sensor and platform descriptions from one or more sensors 
attached to a platform. 

● Sensor Planning Service (SPS) – An open interface for a web service by which 
a client can 1) determine the feasibility of collecting data from one or more 
sensors and 2) submit collection requests. 

● Sensor Alert Service (SAS) - Provides notification of events such as 
measurements, sensor anomalies, observation actions 

3.1.4 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where 
Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web 
standards. The W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. 

W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has 
the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, 
powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device.  

W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process 
designed to maximize consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure 
high technical and editorial quality, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader 
community. 

Current W3C Standards used in marine community include the following. 

● Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) – Ontology for describing sensors and their 
observations. This standard is published jointly with OGC. 

● Resource Description Framework (RDF) - Standard model for data 
interchange on the Web. 

● SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) - An RDF query 
language, that is, a semantic query language for databases, able to retrieve and 
manipulate data stored in RDF format. 



 

45 

3.2 Emerging Community Standards  

RFI, workshop and roundtable responses described new or emerging OGC and other 
community standards and protocols that may be used within an MSDI. Many within 
the community are beginning to use the following standards and protocols. 

● GeoPackage - An open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, 
self-describing, compact format for transferring geospatial information. The 
GeoPackage Encoding Standard describes a set of conventions for storing the 
following within an SQLite database: vector features; tile matrix sets of 
imagery and raster maps at various scales; attributes (non-spatial data); and 
extensions. Since a GeoPackage is a database, it supports direct use, meaning 
that its data can be accessed and updated in a "native" storage format without 
intermediate format translations. GeoPackages are interoperable across all 
enterprise and personal computing environments, and are particularly useful 
on mobile devices like cell phones and tablets in communications 
environments with limited connectivity and bandwidth. 

● SWE Common Data Model – Defines low-level data models for exchanging 
sensor related data between nodes of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement 
(SWE) framework. 

● SWE Service Model -– Defines data types for common use across OGC 
Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) services including operation request and 
response types. 

● SensorThings API (http://ogc-iot.github.io/ogc-iot-api/) - OGC standard 
specification for providing an open and unified way to interconnect IoT 
devices, data, and applications over the Web. Existing Sensor Web 
implementations (e.g. those using OGC Sensor Observation Service) may be 
enhanced with additional SensorThings API support as well as support of 
regular REST- and JSON-bindings of the OGC Sensor Observation Service 
and ISO/OGC Observations and Measurements standards. The availability of 
both types of implementation would be the basis for a scientifically sound 
comparison and implementation. 

● MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) - It is a publish/subscribe, extremely 
simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices 
and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. 



 

46 

3.2.1 3D Standards 

3D data standards for the marine domain are emerging as an important 
interoperability technology. The ability to discover, access and share these datasets 
has increased in importance in recent years.  These 3D Data Standards support 
activities such as inundation and storm surge modeling, hydrodynamic modeling, 
shoreline mapping, emergency response, infrastructure inspection, hydrographic 
surveying, and coastal vulnerability analysis. 

 
Figure 3.1: Point Cloud Shipwreck (Source:  2G Robotics Inc.) 

The following are a few of the standards that are currently being used by RFI 
respondents, workshop and roundtable attendees. 

● 3D Portrayal Service (3DPS) - The 3DPS standard describes how a client 
and service negotiate what is to be delivered and in which manner, to enable 
interoperable 3D portrayal. It provides the ability to view, analyze and 
combine 3D geoinformation from diverse sources in a single view. This is a 
joint standard between the OGC and the W3D consortium. 

● Indexed 3D Scene Layer (I3S) - The I3S format is an open 3D content 
delivery format used to rapidly stream and distribute large volumes of 3D GIS 
data to mobile, web and desktop clients. I3S content can be shared across 
enterprise systems using both physical and cloud servers. Developed by ESRI, 
along with numerous endorsing organizations. This is an OGC Community 
standard. 



 

47 

● LAS File Format - The LAS file format is a public file format for the 
interchange of 3-dimensional point cloud data between data users. The LAS 
file is intended to contain lidar (or other) point cloud data records. The data is 
used to derive images and 3D surface models. The American Society for 
Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing (ASPRS) is the owner of the LAS 
Specification and was recognized by the OGC as an OGC Community 
standard. 

3.2.2  Linking to IoT Technologies 

There are currently several activities in the Internet of Things (IoT) community that 
may be considered as complementary enhancements of the established Sensor Web 
architectures within the marine community, specifically: 

● Applicability of IoT protocols (e.g. MQTT, AMQP, COAP, LoRaWAN, etc.) 
to marine applications: the complexity of this topic may require dedicated 
work items/work packages as part of new research projects; 

● OGC SensorThings API  - As described in the previous section; 

● W3C Web of Things for IoT (https://www.w3.org/WoT/); and 

● Marine Sensor Web Profiles with Internet of Things technology as dedicated 
chapters of the Marine Sensor Web Profiles Best Practice documentation. 

3.2.3 Push based communication flows 

Push technology, or server push, is a style of Internet-based communication where 
the request for a given transaction is initiated by the publisher or central server as 
opposed to pull/get, where the request for the transmission of information is initiated 
by the receiver or client such as the SOS protocol used in the IoT projects. 

● A profile for the OGC Publish/Subscribe standard that is tailored to the needs 
of marine Sensor Web applications.  

● Push based communication patterns through bandwidth constrained links. 

● Event stream processing tools for marine application scenarios and develop 
exemplary implementations for selected use cases. 

● Publish/Subscribe extensions for existing OGC SOS servers. 



 

48 

3.2.4 Web processing services 

Investigate the coupling of marine Sensor Web services (e.g. SOS servers complying 
to the Marine SWE Profiles recommendations) to OGC Web Processing Service 
instance. This should be realized as a set of demonstrators showing the dynamic 
integration of different observation data sources and process types. The SWE service 
model, common data model provides a framework for such aggregation.  



 

49 

Chapter 4: Marine Data Themes in a MSDI 

Marine data themes represent the features and characteristics of seas, oceans, and 
inland water bodies (i.e., depths, tides, tidal waves, coastal information, reefs) and 
features and characteristics that represent the intersection of the land with the water 
surface (i.e., shorelines), the lines from which the territorial sea and other maritime 
zones are measured (i.e., baseline maritime) and lands covered by water at any stage 
of the tide (i.e., Outer Continental Shelf), as distinguished from tidelands, which are 
attached to the mainland or an island and cover and uncover with the tide.  

Today, a steadily growing wealth of marine data from a wide range of disciplines 
acquired in real-time, near-real time and delayed mode, are available from online 
information systems around the world. While substantial achievements have been 
made in reaching consensus on standards for data and metadata formats, system 
protocols and exchange mechanisms by standardization organizations such as the 
OGC, ISO, IHO and the W3C, there are still a number of gaps prohibiting full 
interoperability between marine information systems. 

4.1 Marine Data Ontology 

To develop an interoperable Marine SDI, a detailed definition of the semantics 
of the data being requested and the services being called is required. A major 
goal of a MSDI is to develop a multi-domain and multilingual ontology of 
marine data and services to provide semantic interoperability within the 
system. 

There are already a considerable number of marine data themes and controlled 
vocabularies for marine data available on the Internet through portals and other 
SDI that vary considerably in function, scope, capability, and content. An 
approach to building an effective marine ontology may be by; analyzing 
existing semantic resources and provide mappings between them, and, gluing 
together the definitions and workflows of the OGC WxS (Web <whatever> 
Services). Tools for the development and population of ontologies may also be 
needed in the semantic infrastructure.  



 

50 

4.2 Examples of Marine Data Themes 

From the RFI responses, workshop and roundtable, there were many themes 
and data categories identified. These have been classified and summarized into 
the following nine possible themes: 

● Hydrography - bathymetry and elevation, topography of submarine, geology, 
coastline, rocks and reefs, substrate, sea areas and boundaries; 

● Oceanography - tides, ocean currents, winds, nutrients and oxygen, sea 
temperature, salinity and density, water column features, meteorology, 
MetOcean;  

● Marine Biology / Scientific - phytoplankton and zooplankton, marine 
ecosystems, biodiversity, marine species and populations, seabirds, habitats 
and geomorphology, toxic elements, water-quality parameters; 

● Ecology, Environmental - nature protection, pollution, sewage discharge, 
ocean dumping, seawater intake, ecological functions and services; 

● Maritime Governance - Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), maritime routes, 
commercial leases, jurisdictional boundaries, tribally governed areas, 
regulatory use restrictions; 

● Transportation - commercial shipping, cruise ships, military vessels, AIS 
Systems, navigational aids - charts, lighthouses, buoys, fog signals and day 
beacons, other navigation services; 

● Infrastructure - orientation facilities, ports and harbor facilities, underwater 
transmission cables, pipelines, power grids, and other structures; 

● Industrial, Commercial - energy production including wind, wave, tidal, 
current, thermal, oil & gas; fisheries, aquaculture, seaweed harvesting, mining 
and mineral extraction; and 

● Tourism, Recreational, Cultural Use - facilities and services for small boats, 
tourist information, diving/snorkeling/swimming areas, wildlife viewing at 
sea, archaeological sites, shipwrecks, shore use, nature parks and protected 
reserves, beaches and recreation areas, recreational fishing. 



 

51 

With the large number of marine data themes, controlled vocabularies and ontologies 
for marine data available, an approach to integrating these may be by analyzing 
existing semantic resources and provide mappings between them. The previous nine 
themes may act as a starting point for this integration that may greatly improve the 
discoverability of data within the Marine SDI.  

Existing ontologies can be used as reference: 

● MarineTLO,  http://aims.fao.org/activity/blog/marinetlo-top-level-ontology-
marine-domain; 

● GEMET, http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet (also applicable to INSPIRE); 
and 

● NETMAR, https://netmar.nersc.no/.

Chapter 5: Data and Governance 

The marine domain provides a unique environment when it comes to data acquisition 
and collection. Much of the data collected is not observable directly and have to be 
captured through the use of specialized marine sensors. More than eighty percent of 
our ocean is unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored3. Given the high degree of 
difficulty and cost in exploring our ocean, researchers have long relied on 
technologies such as sonar to generate maps of the seafloor. It is estimated that less 
than ten percent of the global ocean is mapped using modern sonar technology and 
that most of the seafloor that has been mapped thoroughly is close to shore.  

Marine data collecting also needs to handle extreme weather conditions in harsh 
environments, which requires sophisticated health, safety, and environment (HSE) 
training and expertise.  This chapter addresses data aspects from two perspectives. 
The first (5.1) is from the data consumer side, who has particular needs on the type 
and format of the data; with further requirements on update rates, reliability, quality 
and other characteristics. The second (5.2) part addresses data sets that are already 
available. This part only highlights a number of data sets that were suggested by RFI, 
workshop, and roundtable respondents, and are ideally available at standardized 
interfaces. A more complete inventory of available data sets shall be developed in the 
course of a possible future pilot project. The chapter continues to address Governance 
(5.3) as it relates to a Marine SDI. 

5.1 Data and Tool Usage of RFI Respondents 

There were four polar (yes/no) questions about data and tool usage that were included 
in the RFI. The first question determines whether the respondent relied on any global, 
regional, national or local datasets in the marine domain. The next question 
determined if the respondent felt there were adequate tools for analysis of marine 
data. The third question determined if the respondent thought their data or tools were 
only accessible to limited, experienced people or general populations. The last 
question attempted to determine if the respondents used data models. It should be 
noted that there was an approximate 60% response rate to questions one, two and 
four, while question three had a response rate of 84%.

Figure 5.1: Data and Tool Usage of RFI Respondents  (Source: OGC) 

As shown in Figure 5.1, all (100%), of those that responded to the question, indicated 
that there were datasets in the marine domain that they relied upon. Over 90 percent 
(93%), of those that responded to the question, indicated that there were adequate 
tools for marine data analysis and the same percentage (93%) indicated that they used 
data models. However, one third (33%), of those that responded to the question, 
indicated that the marine tools or data were only accessible to limited, or experienced 
people. 

One of the key takeaways from these responses is that approximately two thirds of 
respondents felt that marine data and tools are accessible to the general public. This 
fact was also brought forward in the workshop and it is recommended that a future 
pilot may try and achieve even greater public accessibility.  



 

54 

5.2 Data Requirements 

The requirements for data and information in the marine domain are being driven by 
a broad range of societal, operational, and scientific imperatives. The world's oceans 
greatly affect changes taking place across many domains, including climate, 
atmosphere, and ecosystems, which have significant impacts in the regions and, 
through complex earth system connections, worldwide. The drivers include both 
national and international science policies, strategies, and programmes that contribute 
to an understanding of the changes taking place in the marine domain and shape 
policy responses. To better understand the following requirements on data sets, table 
5.1 provide some examples of marine science activities. 

Research Theme Examples of Scientific Activities

Table 5.1: Examples of marine scientific activities that drive information 
requirements 

Operations in the marine environment take place in some of the most difficult 
conditions on Earth. Those involved in these operations, such as shipping and 
fisheries companies, offshore oil and gas operators, research organizations, coast 



 

55 

guards, and local communities, require access to reliable and often near real-time 
information to plan and undertake their activities. Drivers of information 
requirements include a range of regulations, standards, and policies aimed at ensuring 
the safety of life and mitigating negative environmental impacts. Examples of polar 
operational activities are contained in table 5.2. Of course, these activities are not 
solely exclusive to polar areas. 

Theme Examples of Operational Activities 

Environmental Impact 
Assessment  

● Supporting the responsible development of major offshore infrastructure or 
resource development projects 

● Assessing and mitigating the operation of such projects 

Engineering Design ● Design of buildings and structures for installation in changing marine 
conditions 

● Design of offshore drilling and production platforms for safe and effective 
deployment in ice-covered waters 

Safe Navigation and

● Establishing new regulations and standards, investing in new infrastructure, 
and enhancing operational capabilities in reaction to changes in the marine 
climate and its impact  

● Expeditious movement of responders and their equipment from bases of 
operation to the emergency site 

Table 5.2: Examples of marine operational activities that drive 
information requirements 

There are a number of general requirements that apply to many data types, such as 
real-time data availability, or data quality, coverage and resolution. Based on an 
analysis of the RFI responses, datasets for the following key data categories have been 
identified to be required within an effective Marine SDI at minimum. Some of the 
categories tend to be cross cutting, meaning that they may use data from other 
categories within the list. This is not an exhaustive list and the list is in no particular 
order. 



 

56 

● Hydrographic data 
○ Hydrographic data should be the foundation of any Marine SDI 

as it relates to the measurement and description of the physical 
features of oceans, seas, coastal areas, lakes and rivers within a 
given country or region. This would typically include seabed 
topography (bathymetry), marine infrastructure (e.g., offshore 
installations, pipelines, and cables), hazards (e.g., wrecks, rocks, 
and obstructions), aids to navigation, administrative and legal 
boundaries, and areas of conservation, marine habitats and 
oceanography.  

○ Nautical charting and seabed data. 
○ Possible crowdsourced hydrographic data as collected by 

shipping, cruise ship companies and other stakeholders. 
○ Horizontal and vertical datum, maritime baseline, seabed 

characteristics, marine boundaries, shoreline. 
 

● Oceanographic data 
○ Ocean currents, waves and tides. 
○ Water properties including water temperature, salinity, 

fluorescence, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, suspended 
material, chromophoric dissolved organic matter. 

○ Geology, offshore minerals, oceanographic features. 
○ Sea ice and iceberg presence, density, and velocity. 

 
● Land and coast data 

○ Topographic base maps (high and medium resolution DEM) and 
coastal mapping. 

○ Land cover, offshore cadaster, land ownership, flood hazards, and 
gazetteer. 

○ Optical and radar imagery with long term historic imagery to provide 
valuable insights into changes and near real-time imagery to monitor 
the region. 

 
● Vessel Tracking. Continual near real-time monitoring of traffic via AIS or 

remote sensing together with historic data on vessels’ voyages. Data should 
include vessel position, velocity, voyage, and historical track and position 
information. 



 

57 

● Port information and data. 

● Meteorology and Climate including wind velocity and direction, air 
temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure as well as climate 
parameters and indices.  

● Cryosphere Data such as areas of snow, ice and frozen ground to support 
research on warming permafrost, reduction in snow cover extent and duration, 
reduction in summer sea ice, increased loss of glaciers and the break-up of ice 
shelves. 

● Historical Data: such as data used for Marine spatial planning (MSP), a 
process that brings together multiple users of the marine environment to make 
informed and coordinated decisions.  

● Real-time Sensor Data: This data category includes data received in real time 
from available marine sensor systems. 

● Crowd-Sourced Data: Advances in technologies and communications, 
coupled with the rapid rise and adoption of social media applications have 
created a new category of data in the marine environment. This has now 
enabled citizens to generate real-time, georeferenced data that may be useful 
within a Marine SDI. 

It was stated in many of the RFI responses and the workshop discussions, that in 
general, all data should be available in, or transformable to, different projections using 
different datums for efficient map productions or integrated processing and analysis 
operations. 

Globally, the marine domain has very valuable data that can be leveraged in ways that 
cannot be foreseen. It has traditionally been a challenge to integrate this data from the 
many established digital data centers however efforts to do so tend to be limited to a 
particular region or theme. As part of a future pilot project the ability to deploy a 
wider integration of this data would be pursued: 

● Identify marine domain data repositories and portals; and 

● Test standards and Web services, as well as best practices of data management 
to achieve this integration. 



 

58 

5.3 Metadata and Catalogs 

Many catalogs and registries make use of OGC Services and their corresponding ISO 
TC211 documents. For example, the IHO S-100 provides the data framework for the 
development of the next generation of Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC), as well 
as other related digital products required by the hydrographic, maritime and GIS 
communities. S-100 is based on the ISO 19100 series of geographic standards. This 
means that S-100 based data is compatible with data created according to the relevant 
ISO standards. An  S-100 online registry based on the ISO 19135 standard 
(Procedures for Registration of Geographical Information Items), has been 
established for the registration, management and maintenance of the various 
dictionaries of items recognized under the S-100 framework. The registry contains 
the following principal subordinate registers: 

● Feature Concept Dictionary (FCD) register 
● Portrayal register 
● Metadata register 
● Product Specifications register 
● Data Producer Code register 

It has been recommended that metadata (or a subset of metadata) follow the ISO 
19115 (Geographic Information - Metadata) and corresponding ISO 19139 
(Geographic Information - Metadata XML schema implementation), or their 
respective profiles, CSDGM (FGDC Content Standard for Geospatial Metadata), the 
Dublin Core, or INSPIRE guidelines and implementation rules. In addition, the 
emerging DCAT standard may be analyzed in more detail for its applicability in SDIs. 
This is an idea that could be explored further as part of a future pilot. 

5.4 Data Identified 

Despite many areas still lacking sufficient data coverage (or available data is of coarse 
resolution or low quality), quite a number of data sets are already available. Appendix 
A provides an overview of data sets that have been identified in the MSDI workshop, 
RFI responses, MSDI roundtable or referenced in literature. In addition, there is a list 
of data portals online (see Appendix B for details).  



 

59 

5.5 Governance 

This section will concentrate on high level governance goals instead of the collective 
decision making process that may often get blurred by the large number of 
stakeholders that participate in a SDI and may implement very little in an overlapping, 
collective decision making processes. For an optimal performance of any SDI, it is 
highly recommended to study the lessons learned as documented, for example, in Box 
and Rajabifard, 2009, which groups the most pertinent governance lessons learned 
into institutional, business, data and service categories and ranks them based on a 
number of case studies’ results. Additionally, the United Nations Committee of 
Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) has created The 
Statement of Shared Guiding Principles for Geospatial Information Management that 
are exemplified by “a strong, successful and relevant geospatial information 
organization.” Innovation, Governance, and Compliance are the section in which all 
the Shared Guiding Principles, are organized, with Governance containing the 
majority of the Principles.  

5.5.1 High Level Governance Goals 

In the following section, a number of high level governance goals are briefly 
introduced that are of significant importance in any collaborative decision support 
system that focuses on the marine domain. These goals are shown in figure 5.2.

● Interoperability - Interoperability, the ability to easily discover, access and 
share data across systems and users, is one of the most important priorities 
identified by RFI responders and workshop attendees. An interoperable 
system must enable data accessibility that can support many different users. 
This may require visualization or other mediation such as translating 
vocabularies to make data usable by different communities. Achieving 
interoperability will require adequate resources, a certain level of 
standardization, and a connected community.  

● Standards and Specifications - The overarching purpose of many in the 
marine community is to promote and facilitate international collaboration 
towards the goal of free, ethically open, sustained, and timely access to marine 
data through useful, usable, and interoperable systems. This includes 
facilitating the adoption, implementation and development (where necessary) 
of standards that will enable free, open and timely access to data.  

● Metadata - The objective of this activity is to develop recommendations on a 
common set of metadata elements relevant across the marine domain, that 
facilitate discovery, interoperability and sharing between data repositories and 
online portals. To start, this effort should focus on identifying initiatives that 
have established a metadata template, schema, or profile. Initially, a limited 
set of disciplines or focus areas will be identified to make the scope 
manageable. Wherever possible and practical, the effort will build on and/or 
contribute to other related initiatives. 

● Data Publication - The objective of this activity is to provide a report and 
guide on data publication and citation for marine data providers and enablers. 
This would provide the marine community with a resource to help them to 
understand developments in this area, including assignment of DOIs (Digital 
Object Identifiers) to published data sets. 

● Effective Communications - Through the established bodies of the marine 
community, improved communication, outreach, and coordination is needed 
to provide improved stakeholder engagement.  

● Community Building - Improved data sharing, that is part of a broader global 
system, requires community building, collaboration, and coordination of 
efforts. To achieve this, a better understanding of the nature of the marine 
community (who is doing the work, where, and the systems and processing 



 

61 

workflows, etc.) across many scales, and what is collectively trying to be 
achieved is required. It is also important to recognize engaging with broader 
global initiatives ongoing in the marine domain.  

● Data Preservation and Rescue - Continuous reuse and re-purpose of past 
observations is key to increase current understanding. Therefore, data and all 
the necessary descriptive information must be preserved. Too often, 
preservation is forgotten, and data managers must pursue costly and time 
intensive data rescue activities. Even current data are at risk of loss. Strategic 
data rescue programs must be developed, and preservation must be prioritized 
as a long-term investment and cost-saving measure.  

● Adequate Resources - Making progress will require adequate financial, 
technical, and human resources. More focus is needed on the training of early 
career scientists and youth to ensure that they have the necessary data literacy 
to engage in intensive research while contributing to and benefiting from an 
open, interoperable system. 

In Norway, a national governmental geospatial strategy was developed in 2017 with 
a vision to improve the overall value and usefulness of geospatial information to its 
society. This framework tended to concentrate on the high level governance goals, 
discussed above, merged with the four pillars of a SDI discussed in chapter 2. The 
main goals for this strategy is to: 

● Establish a national platform of knowledge through geospatial information, in 
accordance to user priorities; 

● Incorporate technological tools and interoperability to increase efficiency and 
improve innovation; 

● Improve and further develop cross-sectorial cooperation and collaboration 
arenas; and 

● Adapt policies and framework conditions to meet the challenges within 
geospatial infrastructure, e-Governmental services and the digital society in 
general. 

Figure 5.3 illustrates this SDI strategy.

5.5.2 Recommendations for Collaboration 

Collaboration through effective communications and community building are key 
components of high level governance goals.  To emphasize these components, two 
items shall be further discussed. The first is to help attract additional stakeholders by 
enabling data access from other contributors and the second is to have starting points 
for further collaboration on the organizational level. This list serves as a starting point 
and does not make any claims of being complete. 

It is recommended that a prospective pilot reaches out to, and collaborates with the 
following. 

● the International Hydrographic Organization’s Marine Spatial Data 
Infrastructure Working Group (IHO MSDIWG). 

● National Oceanography Centre (NOC) – British Oceanographic Data Centre 
(BODC) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) designated 
data center for marine environmental data. 

● International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) of the 
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission" (IOC) of UNESCO. 



 

63 

● UN Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management 
(UN-GGIM) Working Group on Marine Geospatial Information (WG-MGI). 

● The United Nations (UN) Integrated Geospatial Information Framework - A 
UN endorsed initiative built upon the work of the UN Committee of Experts 
on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) and the World 
Bank. It is providing a roadmap to help countries develop, manage, and use 
vital geospatial data to address development challenges. 

● Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) - This legislative 
Directive of the European Parliament established an infrastructure for spatial 
information in Europe to support policies or activities which may have an 
impact on the environment.  

Global interaction at this level cannot be over-emphasized.

Chapter 6: MSDI Interoperability Reference 
Architecture 
The architecture of an SDI is a multi-dimensional concept, including software, 
hardware, deployments, networks, operations, federations and many others. Figure 
6.1 identifies a large number of aspects that play a role in architecture design and 
definition. 

 
Figure 6.1: Architectural aspects that need consideration 

The goal of any future pilot would be to demonstrate the value of an integrated SDI 
for Marine Data Management. It has been agreed that one of the best approaches to 
demonstrate value and increase stakeholders’ adoption rates is a careful and well 
planned implementation of a Marine SDI serving all stakeholders needs. The 
following sections discuss architecture requirements, perspectives, and concentrates 
on a number of key aspects to support the future development of a possible MSDI 
Interoperability Reference Architecture as a starting point for a future Pilot. 

6.1 Architecture of RFI Respondents 

There were two polar (yes/no) questions that were linked to architecture and a Marine 
SDI. The first question determined whether the respondent had or provided a marine 
data management system and the second question determined if the respondent used 
geospatial standards to access data and services. It should be noted that there was an 
84% response rate to these questions. 

As shown in figure 6.2, 81% of those that responded to the question, indicated they 
had a marine data management system and 90% of those that responded to the 
question, indicated they used geospatial standards to access data and services.  



 

65 

 
Figure 6.2: Architecture and Standards of RFI Respondents  (Source: OGC) 

These results indicate that the vast majority of those in the marine domain use 
geospatial standards. However there are still some who do not. 

6.2 Requirements 

To address stakeholder needs outlined in chapter 2, there are a number of overarching 
requirements for an optimal Marine SDI architecture. These are described in terms of 
data sharing, standards and interoperability, funding and investment, integration with 
existing systems, agility and adaptability, and security, privacy and safety. Figure 6.2 
illustrates these categories. 



 

66 

 
Figure 6.3: High level requirement categories 

The following sections will briefly examine more details on the various categories 
that ensure a robust baseline for the development of a Marine SDI architecture. 

6.2.1 Open Data & Data Sharing 

Open Data & Data Sharing addresses both legal as well as technical aspects such as 
how to enable data sharing among disparate and heterogeneous endpoints and systems 
using common data models and schemas. Open data is the idea that some data should 
be freely available to everyone to use and re-publish as they wish, without restrictions 
from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. Open Data & Data Sharing 
further addresses organizational aspects such as how to encourage data sharing with 
social or economic incentives and enforcement of rules. 

● Any Marine SDI shall broker the delivery of government and non-
governmental marine observations. 

● The architecture shall support real time observations. Traditionally, this has 
been difficult to achieve due to the proprietary nature of the sensor interfaces 
used for real time observations. New technologies such as SensorThings API 
should can be implemented to help reduce this difficulty.  



 

67 

● The architecture shall support creation and exchange of research-oriented 
synthesized data sets (i.e. simulation model outputs). 

● All data shall be accompanied by metadata. Exploration into minimizing the 
need for manually generated metadata should be continued. 

● The architecture should consider bandwidth flexibility, for situations such as 
sudden surge in users during or right after an extraordinary event (e.g., 
hurricane/typhoon, earthquake-tsunami, etc.), when the need of updated and 
authoritative information is paramount for first responders. 

6.2.2 Standards and Interoperability 

Standards and Interoperability addresses mechanisms and agreements to ensure that 
components being part of or that are loosely connected to a Marine SDI can 
communicate with each other. 

● Interoperability of SDI components across platforms is of overall importance. 

● Data in open, standardized formats should be served by Web interfaces using 
standardized encodings. 

● Standards-based Web GIS integrates and leverages all the investments that 
have already been made in GIS and hydrographic standards, data, and 
technologies. Any Marine SDI should benefit from these investments and 
should be based on these standards. 

● Detailed compliance tests shall be available to ensure interoperability across 
components. 

● Unstructured data feeds should be analyzed to determine the best format to 
enable sharing with other users for further process in the marine domain 
workflow. 

6.2.3 Funding and Investments 

The operation and maintenance of a successful Marine SDI generates substantial costs 
that need to be covered by funding agencies or invested by companies with the goal 
to generate proportionate profit in the future. In terms of business needs, the following 
aspects need to be considered. 



 

68 

● Adequate funding from the various public sectors; at least initially. 

● Funding issues may arise if the benefits to be gained from a Marine SDI are 
not sufficiently understood by funding bodies within the marine domain and 
beyond. 

● Development of relevant applications in the private sector to generate 
desirable return on investment. 

● Recognition of marine data as an investment rather than a cost, which is 
possible through geospatial consortia making the data interoperable between 
different users to be utilized in an interoperable manner for business purposes, 
to support sustainable economic development, and prevent and recover from 
disasters quickly. 

● Any Marine SDI shall consider not only one-time costs associated with 
implementing the solution but the ongoing requirements to support, maintain 
and enhance the solution over its lifecycle to ensure it continues to deliver 
value and meet stakeholder needs. 

● Individual management objectives, priorities, planning cycles and investment 
capacity are all constraints that will affect an organization's ability to 
participate in the development of a Marine SDI. 

● Cost efficiency is key and any Marine SDI should be implemented as much as 
possible out-of-the-box - meaning using existing cloud hosting and server 
based geospatial solutions and without the added expense of in-house software 
development. 

6.2.4 Integration with Existing Systems 

Integration with existing systems is a critical aspect to ensure neat integration of data 
hosted in external systems and the protection of investments in other SDIs or 
platforms that shall be conserved. Therefore, a Marine SDI must: 

● Coordinate with national and international Marine, Hydrographic and 
Oceanographic authorities that provide data for the marine domain; 

● Coordinate with international, national and regional SDIs and MSDIs; 



 

69 

● Integrate with national and regional SDIs without replicating already available 
resources; 

● Integrate with and support widely deployed geographic information systems 
(GIS); 

● Not be perceived as a competitor to local, regional, or national SDIs; 

● Integrate data platforms operated by national space agencies or other 
organizations providing satellite-derived data products; and 

● Connect (as practical) with any possible marine data provider (industry, 
academia, research entities). 

6.2.5 Architecture and Platforms 

Architecture and Platform aspects play a key role in distributed spatial data collection, 
exploration, and processing environments; and need to ensure that the targeted Marine 
SDI can keep pace with changing technologies and Internet trends. The following 
high-level requirements have been identified. 

● Development efforts for any SDI could be constrained by how prescriptive the 
architectural design is at the outset. To benefit from rapidly improving 
technology, a Marine SDI needs to remain flexible and agile. Architectural 
decisions affect costs and the ability to benefit as technology changes. Early 
architectural decision can translate into constraints if they are too rigid in their 
approach. Therefore, questions such as these must be addressed. 

○ Will the Marine SDI be a loose federation of portals and platforms 
discoverable by open specifications and standards allowing as-is 
communities to participate?  

○ Or will the Marine SDI be highly architected and all data and apps 
services be available as hosted/re-hosted services (cloud and/or on-
premise)?  

○ Or any combination of the above two approaches? 

● Technical knowledge and availability of skills is often a limiting factor in 
stakeholders adopting technical solutions, or in continuing efforts to maintain 
solutions already in place. The architecture has to cater for greatly varying 



 

70 

paces at which organizations adapt new technology and will have to bridge a 
wide variety of technical solutions of differing ages and platforms. 

● A Marine SDI shall be very dynamic and flexible because change is occurring 
at a very high rate. New data sets are continually added and a huge number of 
monitoring data sets are updated constantly. 

● A Marine SDI should consider low-bandwidth and offline capabilities for 
where Internet connectivity is limited or non-existent for users operating far 
offshore. Marine SDI designers must decide if they will provide infrastructure 
as well as data and apps. Examples of using data appliances that are loaded 
with data, software, and apps, such as GeoPackage, shall be explored. 

● Intuitively designed user interfaces and website structure/navigation best 
practices to lower the entry barrier and provide ease of access to a Marine SDI. 

● Efficient search functionality and fast or flexible download rates. 

● Preservation of the national language, support for multilingualism, and 
technical language requirements should be taken into account. 

● The architecture shall allow for future extensions and allow the integration of 
upcoming new patterns to handle e.g., Big Data or semantic annotation. 

6.2.6 Security, Privacy and Safety 

Security, Privacy and Safety includes aspects such as vulnerability to attacks, 
acceptance and assurance of privacy concerns, secure and reliable access, protection 
of intellectual property rights, and assurance of system availability in critical 
situations, e.g. emergency responses or major crises. Additionally, Data Integrity is 
crucial in secure infrastructures where the maintenance and the assurance of the 
accuracy and consistency of data persists over its entire life-cycle (Boritz, 2004). 
Users need to identify the source of the data and to be sure that the data was not 
modified in the process. Additional items mentioned in RFI responses include the 
following. 

● Many data sets are access-protected for good reasons (e.g. security 
implications or commercial or government interests). Though these reasons 
are fully acknowledged, Marine SDI design should provide for obtaining 
information about how to access datasets that are not open but may be 



 

71 

accessed through some other means. For example, industrial stakeholders who 
procure their own data collection programs often are protective of the data set 
but are willing to share them under certain circumstances. The necessary 
brokering has to be addressed. 

● Foundational data shall be provided as license-free data (public sector) for 
ease of reuse during crisis support. 

● Individual logins, firewall protection and a secure server connections capable 
of transferring and storing highly sensitive data need to be available. 

6.3 SDI Technology Approaches 

When it comes to SDI design reflected in the RFI responses, two important 
approaches must be differentiated. They are not mutually exclusive and a chosen 
approach can still be complemented by the other. In fact, both approaches represent 
the two extremes of a given continuum, with most implementations, including a 
Marine SDI, will feature some level of middle course. Nevertheless, the architecture 
design differs depending on the preferred approach. The first approach focuses on a 
closely architected infrastructure that provides data and apps as services. Thus, the 
defined architecture caters for a defined set of services (includes rehosted services) 
that are operated and maintained by a SDI control board, i.e., a group with control 
over the individual components. The second approach focuses on infrastructures, 
platforms, and geoportals as they currently exist and emphasizes their integration into 
a federation of systems.  Here, emphasis is on discoverability and integration based 
on open standards. The first approach puts more control into the hands of the control 
board, whereas the second approach provides more flexibility and distributed 
responsibilities. Key to both approaches is the strong adherence to standards to avoid 
vendor lock-in with limited flexibility and extensibility. It should be emphasized that 
both approaches can complement each other, i.e., they do not necessarily act in 
isolation, but support interfaces to allow mutual usage. 

6.3.1 Closely Architected Approach 

The first, closely architected approach is illustrated in figure 6.4. The platform itself 
consists of the infrastructure, the content, any number of Application Programming 
Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs), and application and 
content management tools. The actual applications are usually provided as external 



 

72 

components or as web-based thin clients. The key here is the fact that the entire 
system focuses on the single platform concept, which means that the individual layers 
and implemented aspects are not particular characteristics of the closely architected 
approach. It is the way they are implemented and linked with each other. 

 
Figure 6.4: Closely Architected Approach, source: ESRI (modified) 

The infrastructure includes the hardware and software needed to operate a Marine 
SDI. The infrastructure design will need to take into consideration the different user 
scenarios, data sources (either managed by the SDI or coming from third party 
sources), appropriateness of cloud technologies, current and future IT policies, and 
existing hosting capacity. The Marine SDI will need to account for offline or 
restricted bandwidth situations. To mitigate these, the SDI could consider using data 
appliances, container formats such as GeoPackage. 

The content aspect of the Marine SDI can be broken down into the following. 

● Geospatial data management - this includes the technologies and workflows 
for managing vector and raster data that will be managed and used in the 
Marine SDI. Following the best practices defined by INSPIRE and/or the 
Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) for the National Spatial Data 
Infrastructure (NSDI), the Marine SDI would define the key spatial and 
nonspatial data layers that support the needs of the use cases of the Marine 
SDI. For these data layers, data management and portfolio management 



 

73 

policies and procedures need to be defined. This includes, but is not limited 
to, data models, data update frequencies, conflation of multi-source data, data 
quality assurance, and availability assurances. 

● Real-time data management - this includes the technologies and workflows 
for ingesting and using real-time data feeds such as sensor feeds, vessel 
tracking, news feeds, and feeds from other systems relevant for the Marine 
SDI. 

● Data integration with 3rd-party systems - this allows the feeding (push) or 
consuming (pull) data from the Marine SDI. For this, a Web services approach 
using common service interface specifications that build on international 
standards from the OGC, W3C, IHO, and others are recommended. 

APIs and SDKs: If data is the fuel of an SDI, APIs and SDKs form the engine that 
powers the applications and integration with 3rd-party components. Whatever 
platform is selected, it needs to offer an effective way to create and manage geospatial 
applications to developers. The offered APIs and SDKs shall support building web, 
mobile, and desktop apps that incorporate mapping, visualization, analysis, and more. 

Application and Content Management: This component provides the tools and 
concepts that allow for organizing the content in the Marine SDI in logical and easy 
to understand groups of thematic or organizational structures. In many cases Content 
Management is performed through portals. 

Applications: The entire platform will be accessed through a number of applications 
that are tailored to the specific user audiences of the SDI. This component may 
include map applications for viewing, editing, analyzing, and collecting content. The 
applications may vary, from templates that are used to tell stories around specific 
issues in the marine domain, to advanced desktop GIS that connects to the metadata 
catalog and discovers web services and other content to consume. The important 
realization and consideration is that not all users will engage with a Marine SDI 
through the portal or through the applications managed as part of the SDI. 

6.3.2 Federated Approach 

The second approach is illustrated in Figure 6.5. This approach, shown here with 
focus on service interfaces and encodings, identifies four main components, 
visualized using different background colors. The dark components at the bottom 



 

74 

represent data sources such as geospatial feature data, geospatial raster data, map, 
sensor, and other data. This data is served by a number of services that belong to 
different classes, such as data access services, processing services, sensor web 
services, discovery services, or other services. These services make use of 
standardized data models and encodings. Visualization and decision support tools and 
applications make use of the data provided by the various services in standardized 
formats. 

 
Figure 6.5: Federated Approach, source: OGC 

This approach concentrates on service interfaces and encodings. It allows an entirely 
decoupled and loosely federated infrastructure with minimized, necessary, a-priori 
knowledge required to interact with the various components. This approach leaves 
aspects such as maintenance, service configuration etc. to the service operators, i.e., 
this functionality is not part of the architecture view, as it is irrelevant for the actual 
SDI. This contrasts with the closely architected SDI concept, where management 
tools and content tools allow control over more than a single SDI component. The 
environment illustrated here needs to be enriched with security settings, which usually 
require some sort of higher level organization if features such as single-sign on shall 
be supported (otherwise service consumer would need to register with every service, 
which works in principle, but is not very practical). 



 

75 

6.4 MSDI Reference Architecture 

The MSDI Reference Architecture must find the right balance between being 
prescriptive while remaining agile to allow for easy integration of upcoming 
technologies. This requires the Marine SDI to be implemented as a loose federation 
of portals and platforms, a federated systems of systems, discoverable by open 
specifications and standards rather than being a highly architected infrastructure with 
data and applications being available as hosted/re-hosted services. 

Independent of the chosen approach, a number of additional aspects have been 
repeatedly identified by RFI respondents and workshop attendees as being relevant 
for a successful Marine SDI. These aspects are usually complemented with the 
standing request for openness as illustrated in figure 6.6. Openness usually refers to 
a number of aspects that describe an element that is openly (in the sense of publicly 
and royalty free) available and reusable, developed in an open process, and accessible 
at minimum costs (in terms of data pure reproduction costs or even no costs). 

 
Figure 6.6: Aspects of openness 

Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination 
accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional. Open systems 
includes open source work and GitHub resources, choices in hardware, operating 
systems, Cloud, databases, developer tools, direct links to non-GIS systems such as 
CAD and BIM, etc.. Open standards include standards as provided by OGC, IHO, 
ISO TC/211, CGSB, FGDC, OASIS, W3C, ASPRS, etc.) and open specifications 
(widely used but not yet adopted by Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) and 
openly published technology such as GeoJSON, Geoservices REST API, etc.) 



 

76 

In addition to these general ‘Open’ requirements, many individual Marine SDI 
architectural requirements were described in the RFI responses and workshop. From 
this valuable input, an ideal Marine SDI architecture shall be designed to provide for 
the following. 

● Registry and Discovery 

○ Rapidly discover and access information, products and data. 

○ Architecture shall support search mechanisms that go beyond 
metadata based keyword search, as metadata is almost never complete 
and often hard to maintain. 

○ Auto-registry system for sensors (both remote and in-situ). 

○ Search engine for finding and browsing data, services, and metadata. 
It should be adaptable to allow for a range of search types from basic 
quick searches through detailed searches using multiple criteria 
including: geography, time, organization, physical parameter, etc. 

○ Users able to discover (search), view, assemble and obtain desired data 
and services for a particular area of interest without needing to know 
the details of how the data and services are stored and maintained by 
independent agencies, organizations and data custodians. 

○ Non-mapped search results (e.g. technical reports, multimedia) should 
be associated with mapped search results and viewable in the web 
browser. 

● New Functionality and Extension 

○ Easily publish/reference information, products and data into the 
Marine SDI. 

○ Integration of new functionality. 

○ A Marine SDI is, by nature, federated. It should be as transparent as 
reasonable to an end-user as to where the information being accessed 
is sourced from within the federation. 

○ Consideration may be given to adding an online information network 
with an ontology-based interface on top to visualize databases and 



 

77 

information sources content. The ontology-based approach would 
allow for efficient searches once all data and operation concepts are 
annotated. The ontology-based approach would allow for illustration 
and processing of stakeholder-data relationships, or stakeholder-
processing relationships, which could provide valuable insight for 
other stakeholders with similar requirements, as process could be 
copied or adapted more easily. 

● Low Bandwidth and Offline Usage 

○ Due to the nature of the marine environment, where access to high 
speed data infrastructures are limited, there tends to be low or no 
bandwidth available.  Applications should consider the support of both 
online and offline use of data. 

○ One of its key uses, within a Marine SDI, is the ability to exploit low 
cost mobile devices, such as Android tablets, in the marine 
environment for monitoring, gathering and updating data in areas that 
have no, or poor data communications. Workers in the marine 
environment preload data they may need on to their mobile device 
using a GeoPackager application. They can then go into the field and 
add or update current data on the device. When they return to an area 
with data communication, the GeoPackage will synchronize with the 
original data. 

○ Should allow for proxies that optimize data for transport over limited 
bandwidth connections or other specific purpose tools. 

○ Large datasets need to be made available in very efficient ways to 
support low bandwidth situations. One method suggested would be to 
create a ‘Marine GeoPackage’ that could be pre-loaded with large 
relevant datasets. 

○ Transferring of data via non-internet mechanisms, such as shipping 
hard drives/thumb drives to customers with very limited internet 
connectivity. These drive-deployed datasets shall be made available as 
being directly served from a standards-based Web service, i.e., data 
storage is transparent to the end user. Again, this can be accomplished 
using a Marine GeoPackage. 



 

78 

○ Downloadable datasets in standard formats. 

● External Systems and Formats 

○ Content may be disseminated to other global, national or regional 
networks. This increases the visibility of Marine SDI data and 
information products. 

○ Provide connectivity to legacy/heritage systems. 

○ Support for scanned documents that provide valuable historic data 
sets, including charts, maps, forms, other tabular data (both machine 
and hand written), or hand-drawn sketches. 

○ Support for documentary videos, oral histories, and other sources 
beyond purely numerical data. 

○ Enable e-visualization of information in a geospatial, data analysis 
presentation environment and temporal context. 

● Tailoring 

○ Support both the desktop and mobile environments. 

○ Support multi-lingualism and appropriate character sets. 

○ Support targeted users from a diversity of backgrounds. The efficacy 
of the portal to access information by the uninitiated, the man-of-the-
street, has been proven is key to a successful, i.e., well-used SDI. 

● Key Service Functionality 

○ A mapping interface showing search results. The map portrayal should 
be interactive: pannable, zoomable, changeable projection. Mapped 
items should be interactive: obtain metadata by clicking/hovering, get 
data values by clicking/hovering. 

○ Basic analysis and visualization tools, e.g., navigating long time series, 
statistical analysis on selected data sets or subsets.

Chapter 7: Portals, Applications and Scenarios 

The feedback on current technologies and portals used in marine management, type 
of services that should be available as part of a MSDI, or type of applications shall 
be developed that make use of MSDI was quite varied.  

To the RFI question: “Are there other national, regional or topical portals that can be 
used to support the marine domain that are currently available and serve your needs?” 
all but one respondent said yes. The general view from RFI respondents and 
workshop attendees was that there were many portals available, but no method for 
easily determining what was available in each.  

Finally, this chapter looks at possible scenarios and use cases that could be exercised 
if a Marine SDI Pilot were to be launched. 

7.1 Portals and Software Applications 

From the RFI responses, workshop, and roundtable discussions, the following list of 
current applications includes, on the abstract level, items such as: 

● geospatial portal development 
● mobile platform integration and cross platform mobile app development 
● data warehouse management 
● Internet mapping 
● metadata management 
● gateway creation 
● comprehensive data connectivity 

More detailed applications include: 

● water license management and water quality and quantity flow analysis, 
visualization and modeling 

● Infrastructure monitoring and planning 
● Decision Support Systems 
● Climate change research 

A list of possible key applications that could be made available as part of an MSDI 
include: 



 

80 

● Dashboard for marine monitoring 
● Metadata harvester/broker 
● MSDI Portal for non-technical users 
● MSDI portal for scientists 
● Oil spill tracker/forecaster 

The wide range of potential services shall support the following aspects: 

● Ease of discovery and use 
● Possibility of using in no- or low-bandwidth environments 
● Use of geospatial standards 
● Service level agreements to address business and contractual agreements. 

7.1.1 Marine Portals 

Many regions including Europe, East Asia, the USA, Australia, and Canada are 
making significant progress in facilitating the discovery, access, and long-term 
stewardship of marine data through the development, implementation, and operation 
of national, regional, or international distributed ocean observing and data 
management infrastructures commonly referred to as portals. A comprehensive list 
of marine related portals that were received from RFI respondents, workshop and 
roundtable attendees has been included in Appendix B. 

7.2  Potential MSDI Scenarios 

One of the goals of the study is to identify scenarios and use cases to drive possible 
follow on pilots. It has been agreed that this could best be done by the implementation 
and description of a number of use cases and scenarios that make use of a number of 
data sets discovered and served by the Marine SDI and visualized by Marine SDI 
client components. The following overview is intended as a starting point for the Pilot. 

7.2.1 Offshore Wind Power Site Selection in the Caribbean 

The Caribbean has the potential for a significant increase in wind-powered electricity 
production. A number of wind farm projects have implemented, making wind 
potentially the fastest growing renewable energy technology in the region over the 
next two decades.  



 

81 

For this scenario, a MSDI will be exercised to aid the decision making process to 
determine a site selection for a wind farm being deployed offshore. The following list 
provides a sample of MSDI data that would possibly be required for this scenario. 

● Bathymetry Data (Crowdsourced, Multibeam, Singlebeam, etc.) 
● Major Maritime Transportation Routes 
● Coastline Data 
● Continental Shelf Boundary 
● Digital Elevation Models 
● Marine Geology and Geophysical Data 
● Seafloor and Water Column Backscatter Data 
● Marine Meteorological Data 
● Ocean Current Data 
● Sea State Observation Data  
● Sea State Forecast Data 
● Sea Level Data 
● Tide Forecast Data 
● Marine Species and Habitats Data 
● Marine Ecosystems  
● Fisheries Data 
● Geographical Regions (Marine Names / Gazetteer) 
● Maritime Limits and Boundaries 
● Aids to Navigation 
● Pipelines 
● Ports and Harbour Facilities 
● Power Grids, and Other Structures 
● Shoreline Constructions (E.G. Tide Gauges, Jetties) 
● Underwater Transmission Cables 

A specific nation or region within the Caribbean has not been identified and would be 
determined during future pilot activities.  

7.2.2 Land / Sea boundary  

A land / sea boundary scenario would exercise a MSDI for coastal protection and 
shoreline management. In this context, coastal protection would include protection of 
land and property from erosion or encroachment by the sea, and sea/tidal defense in 
estuaries (prevention of temporary flooding events over land). Shoreline management 



 

82 

would be a long term, strategic approach to managing risk from land instability, 
coastal erosion and tidal flooding. 

The last two decades have seen a significant increase in coastal hazards such as 
storms, tsunamis, typhoons, flooding and their impact is more serious now than it 
would have been 50 years ago, not only because the events are bigger than before, but 
also because there are more people living in the coastal zones. According to the United 
Nations, about 40% of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers of a coast4.  

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), over the 1901-
2010 period, the global mean sea level rose by approximately 19 cm (7.5 inches). The 
rate of sea-level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate 
during the previous two millennia5. 

These factors have increased the importance of coastal protection and shoreline 
management for many nations.  

For this scenario, a MSDI will be exercised to aid the development of a shoreline 
management plan and coastal protection and mitigation. The following list provides 
a sample of MSDI data that would possibly be required for this scenario. 

● Bathymetry Data (Crowdsourced, Multibeam, Singlebeam, Etc) 
● Historic Marine Environment Data 
● Coastline Data 
● Continental Shelf Boundary 
● Digital Elevation Models 
● Seafloor and Water Column Backscatter Data 
● Marine Meteorological Data 
● Ocean Current Data 
● Sea State Observation Data  
● Sea State Forecast Data 
● Sea Level Data 
● Tide Forecast Data 
● Marine Ecosystems  
● Fisheries Data 
● Geographical Regions (Marine Names / Gazetteer) 
● Maritime Limits and Boundaries

83 

● Aids to Navigation 
● Pipelines 
● Ports and Harbour Facilities 
● Shoreline Constructions (e.g., Tide Gauges, Jetties) 

A specific nation or region has not been identified and would be determined during 
future pilot activities. However, suggested regions would be Netherlands, Denmark, 
Belgium area or Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar region. This last region 
could also be expanded to include Bangladesh to the west, Indonesia to the east and 
Malaysia to the south. The entire southeast Asia region contains a population of over 
50 million that may be directly exposed and affected by sea conditions due to climate 
change. 

7.2.2 Other Scenario Aspects 

There are a number of aspects that are independent on the specific scenario. Instead, 
they are applicable to almost all scenarios. One very important aspect, in this context, 
are typical issues caused by cross-boundary events, e.g., a stranded cruise ship in the 
Arctic near an international border, such as between the United States and Canada or 
the effects of sea level rise as described in the land / sea boundary scenario. This 
requires bringing together a wide variety of disparate data and cross border 
interoperability. 

Another aspect addresses the reality of dealing with low to no Internet bandwidth in 
some areas. This aspect, that was mentioned several times by respondents, should be 
addressed in at least one pilot implementation scenario.  

A Marine SDI scenario should include at least one use-case involving both public and 
private sector entities sharing a diverse array of marine data. 

The scenario should focus on integrating multiple types of data together (coverages, 
imagery, vector, sensor feeds) over a large scale to fully appreciate the value of a 
unified map service with shared semantics and a shared tiling approach. 

Crowdsourcing marine data through Mobile applications that provide real time 
geolocated visual or other sensor data should be investigated. 

Specific scenarios or use cases for future pilots will be selected by the Sponsors 
during the Pilot Collaboration Phase for each of the pilots. The scenarios or use cases 
may be chosen from the previous topics described in this report or developed 



 

84 

independently by the participants. The Sponsors will decide what possible Marine 
SDI issues or shortcomings they wish to address during the particular pilot.

Chapter 8: Other Factors and Conclusion 

8.1 Other Factors 

RFI respondents, workshop participants, and roundtable attendees discussed other 
success factors or considerations seen as needed for a successful Marine SDI. 

It was noted that a successful, international, Marine SDI may require some, or all of 
the following. 

● Well documented APIs. Support for OGC-based standards and those that use 
emerging standards like the OpenAPI specification, JSON-LD and 
schema.org. 

● Consistent access to, management of, and analysis of AIS data tends to be 
challenging. 

● The primary vulnerability of any MSDI is its reliance on internet and other 
interconnected computer networks. Therefore, the MSDI must be set up with 
high availability but it must also be built on technology that supports 
disconnected workflows and information security must also be considered. 

● Due to its complexity and scope, a future global MSDI project must be divided 
into several manageable subprojects, and develop each MSDI element “brick 
by brick.”  

● Maintenance of an MSDI in the long term (more than five years) may be a 
challenge. There are many dead web portals, not maintained and outdated, but 
still online. 

● Interoperability and harmonization of various datasets. 

● Awareness that MSDI exists and a clear vision of its added value.  

● A clear way to communicate and receive feedback from core users and 
stakeholders.  

● Agreement between data owners regarding all aspects of the MSDI 
(management, availability of data, frequency of data updates, standardization 
progress, etc.). 



 

86 

● careful attention should be paid to address issues such as, information 
technology security, privacy and confidentiality, liability, legal 
interoperability of data and services, and resource allocation.  

Many of the factors described in the following section were discussed in previous 
chapters. 

8.2 Conclusion 

This consultation process, the RFI workshop, and the roundtable were critical to 
collect the views of the marine community and wider stakeholders on Marine SDI 
development, governance and future directions. 

The results form an important step in the evolution of a MSDI. Almost all contributors 
agree on the following conclusions. These are summarized as follows in no particular 
order. 

● Coordination of SDI related activities and collaboration among the various 
organizations involved is a critical success factor for a Marine SDI. A 
successful shared SDI would be a stepping stone to other collaboration 
activities that could focus on increased data collection, introduction of robust 
monitoring programs and ideally reduced duplication of effort. Fostering early 
coordination and planning and encouraging transparency within the public 
sector so that collection priorities and data requirements are clearly stated and 
the most efficient approach can be applied to ensure that end user needs are 
met. 

● It was found that a MSDI Reference Architecture must find the right balance 
between being prescriptive while remaining agile to allow for easy integration 
of upcoming technologies. This requires the Marine SDI to be implemented 
as a federation of portals and platforms discoverable by open specifications 
and standards rather than being a highly architected infrastructure with data 
and applications being available as hosted/re-hosted services. 

● The majority of respondents considered that an MSDI should be community-
driven, fostering links across existing IHO, ocean observing and other data 
initiatives, and gaining commitment and support from the marine community, 
and regional, national and international governments and umbrella 
organizations. MSDI development in the medium-term should be facilitated 



 

87 

by the OGC and other sponsors, building on existing initiatives and support 
for longer-term coordination. 

● Building on the CDS results and the suggestions for future MSDI 
development, e.g., pilot actions, the OGC will produce a strategy to achieve 
this goal. As an ongoing activity, the OGC will seek the support from potential 
sponsors and the community by building a communications strategy to inform 
MSDI developments. 

● From all the needs presented, they can be best summarized into four, high 
level, overarching requirements of any Marine SDI.  

1. Provide stakeholders with appropriate access to the spatial data they need.   

2. Allow different stakeholders, at different locations, to access the SDI. 

3. Allow for data exchange, especially the dynamic data, in an appropriate, 
efficient and secure way. 

4. To achieve one, two and three above, will require the continued and 
increasing use of OGC and other open standards. 

● In the future, integration of near real-time observations from both satellites 
and in-situ sensors will be of increasing importance in the marine 
environment. Traditionally, this has not been easily achieved due to the 
proprietary nature of the sensor interfaces. New technologies such as 
SensorThings API should be considered to ease introduction and use the latest 
sensor / observation technology. 

● To help in remediating issues due to limited bandwidth in much of the marine 
environment, a significant portion of the base or core data can be prepared in 
advance and pre-loaded on mobile devices for field use. This can be 
accomplished by leveraging the GeoPackage standard. 

● All data should be accompanied by metadata. Exploration into minimizing the 
need for manually generated metadata should be continued. 

The above conclusions should not be regarded as a definitive list. Instead, these 
conclusions listed here may provide a focus for a future Marine SDI and a possible 
pilot phase of the CDS.

U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System 
(CMTS) 

AIS data and information is of utmost importance to the maritime community and 
should be included in any MSDI. Directly related to accessibility of AIS information, 
the following Federal data platforms/portals provide access to AIS data. 

U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN) 

The USCG is the national competent authority for AIS and operates the Nationwide 
AIS (NAIS) system, which provides AIS coverage for the coastal continental U.S., 
inland rivers, Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam for monitoring vessel traffic for safety and 
security, providing vessel traffic services, and communicating navigation safety 
information to vessels. 

USCG NAVCEN provides two core services to internal and external stakeholders, 
Data Distribution and AIS Enforcement. NAVCEN provides NAIS data in several 
formats. In 2018, NAVCEN maintained 97 ‘live’ or ‘streaming’ data feeds offering 



 

95 

government partners, USCG Programs, Vessel Traffic Services, port partners and 
other stakeholders near real-time AIS data fed directly from NAIS production servers. 
Federal and non-federal stakeholders can access NAIS information dating back three 
years through Historical Data Requests to re-create events, view trends and norms, 
and inform marine spatial planning. 

Marine Cadastre (https://marinecadastre.gov/) 

The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management jointly manage the Marine Cadastre, a GIS-based marine data 
viewer and repository that provides decision support tools for siting of offshore 
renewable energy, mineral extraction, aquaculture, and other activities. Since 2009, 
the Marine Cadastre has operated as a distributor of USCG NAIS in open and GIS 
formats, storing and providing access to coastal NAIS information from 2009-2017. 
The Marine Cadastre has also developed end-user AIS products like track lines, 
density plots, transit counts, web map services, tutorials and software for desktop GIS 
users. These data, tools, and support material are available to the public for a wide 
range of coastal and ocean management, planning, research, industry, and academic 
purposes. 

Maritime Safety & Security Information System (MSSIS) 

MSSIS is a government-to-government AIS data sharing network, developed and 
operated by the U.S. DOT Volpe Center and funded by the U.S. Navy. Through secure 
Internet-based servers, MSSIS combines AIS data from 74 participating nations 
(including USCG-NAIS as the U.S. contribution) into a single raw-AIS NMEA data 
stream which amounts to over 150 million vessel position reports per day for as many 
as 60,000 vessels or more. Through MSSIS, participating governments can upload 
their local real-time AIS data and receive back the entire combined stream. Two AIS 
data platforms are available for display and conversion of AIS data: Transview and 
SeaVision. 

Users of AIS information range from “General Users” to “Power Users” and 
everything in between. General users are those who are seeking to use limited AIS 
fields over shortened time periods and smaller regions. General users may be 
interested in standard analysis products, such as track lines or vessel density maps. 
General users also include new users entering this space who may not be familiar 
with, or have the capabilities for, technical AIS data analysis. In contrast, “Power 
Users” are those with advanced existing AIS data management capabilities and 



 

96 

familiarity working with raw data, and likely have policy and technical requirements. 
These data identities can be broadly applied to all marine data users as they directly 
influence data capacity.

for high-value environmental data and information has dramatically increased in 
recent years. NCEI is designed to improve NOAA’s ability to meet that demand. 
NCEI is the result of the consolidation of  NOAA’s existing three National Data 
Centers: the National Climatic Data Center, the National Geophysical Data Center, 
and the National Oceanographic Data Center into the National Centers for 
Environmental Information.

NOAA OneStop: NOAA OneStop provides marine domain datasets discoverable 
through a generic search and discovery. The OneStop Project is designed to improve 
NOAA's data discovery and access framework. Focusing on all layers of the 
framework and not just the user interface, OneStop is addressing data format and 
metadata best practices, ensuring more data are available through modern web 
services, working to improve the relevance of dataset searches, and advancing both 
collection-level metadata management and granule-level metadata systems to

accommodate the wide variety and vast scale of NOAA's data. This portal could be 
enhanced by providing greater marine domain specific features by leveraging the 
portal’s application programming interface (API), but such an effort has not been 
pursued yet.

Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS): OBIS is a global open-access 
data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation 
and sustainable development. Its vision is to be the most comprehensive gateway to 
the world’s ocean biodiversity and biogeographic data and information required to 
address pressing coastal and world ocean concerns. It currently has more than 20 
OBIS nodes around the world connecting 500 institutions from 56 countries. 
Collectively, they have provided over 45 million observations of nearly 120 000 
marine species, from Bacteria to Whales, from the surface to 10,900 meters depth, 
and from the Tropics to the Poles. The datasets are integrated so you can search and 
map them all seamlessly by species name, higher taxonomic level, geographic area, 
depth, time and environmental parameters.

SeaDataNet: SeaDataNet is a distributed Marine Data Infrastructure for the 
management of large and diverse sets of data deriving from in-situ of the seas and 
oceans. SeaDataNet has federated open digital repositories to manage, access and 
share data, information, products and knowledge originating from oceanographic 
fleets, new automatic observation systems and space sensors. The online access to in-
situ data, meta-data and products is provided through a unique portal interconnecting 
the interoperable node platforms constituted by the SeaDataNet data centers.

Scientific Information Systems for the Sea (SISMER): SISMER (Scientific 
Information Systems for the Sea) is French Research Institute for Exploitation of the 
Sea's (Ifremer) service in charge of managing numerous marine databases and 
information systems which Ifremer is responsible for implementing. The information 
systems managed by SISMER range from CATDS (SMOS satellite data) to 
geoscience data (bathymetry, seismic, geological samples), not forgetting water 
column data (physics and chemistry, data for operational oceanography – Coriolis -

Key Points 

The following key points were discussed during the MSDI CDS workshop. 

● U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) - Integrate all 
waterway data one of the larger jobs. Interoperability is key. 

● Arctic MSDI is also involved in the CDS 

● Data Discovery: 
○ Can we find data 
○ Can we understand certainty behind data 
○ If you don’t know where the data is you can’t find it. What do you do 

to make data more discoverable? 
○ Still have to think about the public accessibility and discoverability of 

data. 
○ Still a lot of sneaker work.  
○ Still very people centric.  
○ Still difficult. 

● MSDI cannot operate on it’s own. It will cross domains.  

● Builds a sustainable infrastructure 

● Importance of Authoritative Data - How do we trust the data we find - Web 
trust and identification.  Digitally signing ENC charts. There is a certification 
of identity. Crucial that data is authoritative and from authoritative agency. 
Whose data do you use? 

● Different communities with different policies and communications systems 
ontologies, dictionaries connect the personal world and technical world 

● Ensure data can have multiple uses.   Try to understand what / how public is 
going to use the data and the need to track usage 

● Start using AI to distill large amounts of data to better define an outcome. 
○ EG:  Distribution of deep sea corals Using machine learning to help 

explain the distribution of corals 
○ Marine and weather data to fishing companies and aquaculture 

● Ontologies and semantics.  
○ Use ontologies to make data more discoverable? 



 

106 

■ WC3 approach    
■ ISO 191XX approach.   

○ We can do a better job of describing the data. 
○ An international forum – the interoperability model NSG has been 

using has been converted into an ontology and maybe extremely useful 
to actually integrate within the MSDI.  

● Three big Questions for any MSDI  
○ Can I find it? 
○ Can I get it? 
○ Can I use it? 

The more we dive into these 3 questions the more complex things get. 
Keep in mind - Don’t have to provide everything to everyone.  

● Find a new more accessible way to use sensor data on a global scale. 

● Open data means it’s findable 

● Collect data so it’s usable to a broader audience. Think multiple uses.  
Many datasets are being used for purposes that they were not necessarily 
envisioned. Data is in high demand.  Other users find numerous ways in which 
to use this data. 

○ Make the connection between multiple datasets from multiple 
agencies. 

○ Planning data usage across borders.  
○ 3rd or 4th degree users of AIS. Using it ways now that were never 

envisioned.  
○ Distinct agencies have different diverse missions. Collect different 

data for different purposes. It may be useful for other purposes. When 
it makes sense to facilitate alternate uses do it. Find areas of common 
interest.  

● How to ensure stakeholders know you have the data? - Challenge is not 
necessarily knowing what users need but need to know end state users are 
trying to achieve.  

○ Communicate with users first hand. Talk to stakeholders what the need 
how the use data. Having different things for different types of users. 

○ Make sure data is the community standard format - interoperable! 
○ Try to move entry level users closer to power users. 



 

107 

○ Be aware of data gaps that may exist. 

● Use a centralized data model. A MSDI data model that covers every facet of 
marine data.  

● 2000 years of tradition unimpeded by progress. 

● Moving a lot of the data from flat files to dashboards and API tools. Allows 
users to manipulate data in a variety of ways.  

● Offshore oil and gas data collected by companies not currently available and 
is a source of untapped data not available to us.   

● S-100 product specification . Need to drive the adoption of this standard faster.  
Today S-57 is quite restrictive so it is more difficult to disseminate.  Not 
friendly with other applications.  S-101 is a step forward. Using cloud services 
to allow users to access S-102 data and ENC through APIs.  

● Making data available one of the key goals of a MSDI 

● MSDI needs to be a more data centric approach 

● MSDI expanding into ports and harbours. Port infrastructure security 
important. Smart Cities / Smart Ports.  3D visualizations extending into smart 
ports. Limits and Boundaries products allow hooks into cadastral 
management.   

● Goal is to make more of this data available to a broader audience. The tech 
appears to be available for this.  

● Europe is looking to harmonise catalogs, data etc.  Marine Spatial Planning 
Directive (European) may influence.  Standards a big driver. Semantic web 
will change how we do discovery.  

● Enabling data and services is the key to MSDI.  Cloud environments may play 
a key role.   

● MSDI may need aid of AI to process and create future products.  There will 
be much more machine-to-machine interaction.  

● Foundational data for a MSDI?   
○ Bathymetry first foundation. From product makers to authoritative 

data providers. User creates product from different sources of 



 

108 

information and merge them together. MSDI provide logically 
organized datasets.    

○ Raw data may work for power users but Apps will be more available 
to average users.  Combine sources of information without having to 
be an expert.  

○ Keep in mind ships have limited bandwidth. I3S format for large 
amount datasets.  

○ Foundation depends on application for different users. How easy to 
interpret and manage datasets.  

● Three Primary categories of MSDI Users 
○ Owners - Gov agencies, etc. 
○ Enablers – common global standards necessary, encodings, validation, 

catalogs 
○ Users - trust is a big thing for users 

● Other user areas for MSDI 
○ Undersea cables represent several domains. International Cable 

Protection Committee - Something that should be included in MSDI 
○ Navigation and deep-sea mining.  
○ Marine protected areas.  
○ Energy domain.   

 
● Google Dataset Search.  May make getting to geospatial datasets easier.   

Makes it easier to Find the data.

C.2  MSDI Roundtable 

Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure Concept Development Study (MSDI-CDS) 
Roundtable  

DATE: March 27, 2019 

LOCATION: NOAA, Silver Spring, Maryland 

Participants 

There were fifteen participants in the MSDI roundtable split between in-person 
attendees and those that attended online. These attendees represented a good cross 
section of stakeholders in the marine domain. These included: 

● ESRI 
● Geoscience Australia 
● IIC Technologies 
● International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) 
● Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) 
● National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 
● National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 
● Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket) 
● Open Geospatial Consortium 
● Teledyne CARIS 
● United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) 

Agenda 

To make the most of the limited time available, each attendee was asked to focus their 
comments, and/or suggestions, to an assigned section of the draft document. There 
were seven sections of focus: 

● MSDI Assessment for Various Levels (Stakeholders) 
● Currently Used and Emerging Standards 
● Marine Data Themes in a MSDI 
● Data and Governance 
● MSDI Interoperability Reference Architecture 
● Consumer Feedback and Applications 



 

110 

● Scenarios, Use Cases and Other Questions 

This format better facilitated the discussion and provided useful feedback.  

The meeting started at 8:30 AM and continued until 12:30 PM. Approximately 20-30 
minutes was allotted to each section of focus. The following is a summary of the key 
points of the roundtable. 

Summary 

As the roundtable was focused on a draft version of the report, the feedback, 
observations and recommendations concentrated on changes and additions to the 
reports content. The majority of these changes and additions were integrated into the 
final report.
