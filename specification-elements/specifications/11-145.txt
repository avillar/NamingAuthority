Introduction  
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is developing "EarthCube” - Towards a National Data 
Infrastructure for Earth System Science1.  In a new partnership between GEO and the NSF Office of 
Cyberinfrastructure, NSF seeks transformative concepts and approaches to create a sustained, integrated 
data management infrastructure spanning the Geosciences.   Meeting the challenges in geoscience research 
requires innovation and paradigm shifts in cyberinfrastructure. Information technology must advance to 
meet the emerging approaches to science. A cyber-architecture identifies repeatable patterns, reusable 
components, and open standards that provide starting point for innovative developments. 
This white paper was written by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) members and associates to contribute 
to development of the NSF EarthCube.  This document does not represent an official position of the 
OGC.  However, the discussions in this document could very well lead to NSF developments and 
subsequent OGC documents. Recipients of this document are invited to reply to the authors’ with 
notification of any relevant patent rights of which they are aware and to provide supporting documentation. 

Cyberarchitecture for Geoscience 
Cyberarchitecture represents a paradigm shift in scientific research that facilitates collaboration across 
disciplines and across great distances, and enables breakthroughs to be reached more quickly and 
efficiently.  Geospatial cyberarchitecture is a specific type of CI that synergistically integrates the 
capabilities of CI, geographic information systems, and spatial analysis for geospatial problem solving and 
decision-making [Wright 2011a].  The deluge of data from sensor networks, satellites, and cell phones 
cannot be understood or analyzed unless it can be properly managed for interoperability. The complexity of 
geographic space in which these entities are embedded (e.g., at multiple spatial dimensions and scales) 
poses significant computational and intellectual challenges in distributed spatial data mining and analysis, 
the geospatial semantic web, and spatial information infrastructures.  This paper describes elements of 
cyberarchitecture that are vital to advancement of the geosciences. The elements listed here include proven 
technology that can now be applied to geosciences as well as trends in the GeoWeb that will be enhanced 
by results of geoscience implementations. 

Key Elements of Cyberarchitecture for Geosciences 
 Location-based data management, fusion and presentation  
 Semantic and linked data for bridging gaps between geoscience communities  
 Data publication and long-term preservation services 
 Provenance and uncertainty reporting for data/model evaluation and use 
 Increasing geoscience observations from sensors and citizens 
 Environmental models and simulations of many different types 
 Geoscience workflows through mashups of web services 
 Federated resource management 
 Flexibility to operate over different distributed computing platforms 
 Cyberarchitecture based on prototype-driven standards  

 
 Location-based data management, fusion and presentation  

A participatory cyberenvironment enables collaborations that span disciplines, laboratories, organizations 
and national boundaries, and involves working with heterogeneous resources such as sensors, software 
components, databases, scientific instruments and models, and people. It is also an integration and 
presentation platform for knowledge network that requires rich contextual information, including social, 
geospatial, provenance, and semantic contexts.  
Geoscience data is almost always location based. This feature should help define the focus of geoscience CI 
architecture design. For example, for presenting (visualizing) data on a global scale, the architecture should 
allow seamless integration of sub-systems that are geo-politically accepted. That is actually a federated CI

system of regional CI systems. This feature on data visualization should be reflected in data management 
and workflow automation and therefore impose specific requirements in the CI architecture. 

“With the advent of the geospatial web or “geoweb” and community efforts such as Open 
Geospatial Consortium to promote geo-information and solution interoperability, geospatial 
context is playing an increasingly important role in knowledge network presentation and 
integration, which is critical for a participatory Cyberenvironment.” [Liu 2007] 

The ability to discover, access, integrate, analyze, and present geospatial data across a distributed 
computing environment has tremendous scientific value. Indeed, with the growing connectedness of our 
world —through data-collecting instruments, data centers, supercomputers, departmental machines, and 
personal devices — we expect a wide range of information to be instantly accessible from anywhere [Lee 
2008]. 
 

 Semantic and linked data for bridging gaps between geoscience communities  
The geosciences branch into diverse communities, which are usually weakly connected.  Each of these 
communities uses distinct terminologies, data models, environmental simulations, etc. A cyberarchitecture 
to support geoscientists must provide all means to overcome these barriers. Linked Data principles for 
spatial and environmental relationships must play a role in this endeavor.   
The GeoWeb is based on a set of standards for geospatial information. The information standards are of 
many types ranging from syntactic to semantic.  Use of the GeoWeb standards will aid EarthCube in 
responding to this ACCI Finding: 

 “A lack of standards in application programming interfaces, data models and formats, and 
interoperability of programming models makes the integration of different pieces of software 
representing different models and different phases of the workflow challenging.” [ACCI 2011] 

Similar to standards for units of measure, information standards are fundamental to the progress of science. 
Use of internationally accepted standards allows scientists to reliably access and review data and 
information gathered by other scientists in order to advance the knowledge of our world. Geospatial 
information standards provide the basis for communicating data, information and hypothesis about the 
geosciences  [Khalsa 2010]. 
Yet heterogeneity will continue to exist and be useful, requiring introduction of mediators (also termed 
brokers) as has been proposed to implement interoperability in a number of geospatial issues, 
particularly discovery services [Nativi 2009].  This approach addresses shortcomings of catalog 
services by identifying three additional functionalities: Messaging providing support for asynchronous 
communication patterns; Distribution addressing the communication between one consumer and 
multiple producers; Mediation addressing the mismatches between heterogeneous consumers and 
providers. 

 
 Data Publication and long-term preservation services 

The CI must support publication and long-term preservation not only of data references, but of access to the 
data as well.  The overall objective is simple:  make it possible for authors to create online publications that 
enable readers to access, analyze, and display the data discussed in the publication [Domenico 2011]. 
Currently available (formal and community) standard web services have made it possible to create 
rudimentary examples of such data interactive documents.   
The assumption that future scientists will be able to use data collected over long time periods and to 
integrate data from disparate sources to create new datasets is dependent upon interoperability of the data, 
software (including both data base and analytic software), and hardware. Coordination in standards 
development and the use of commonly accepted standards are needed to promote data interoperability, so 
that data collected in different countries, in different time periods, using different software and hardware 
configurations, and across different disciplines can be integrated. (ICSU 2004) 
Data curation is especially important in geoscience due to the long-term temporal features in many 
geoscience phenomena. Other sciences, such as climate change, biodiversity, phenology, can truly benefit 
from well-curated geoscience data. Proper data curation needs careful design and inclusion in the system 
from the beginning, which means extra investment for seeing potential returns many years later. 
 

 Provenance and uncertainty reporting for data/model evaluation and use 



OGC 11-145 – Cyberarchitecture for Geosciences for NSF EarthCube

As an infrastructure for science, EarthCube must address the issues of uncertainty quantification and 
reporting with an emphasis on experimentation. Quality science requires transparency.  This certainly 
includes the characterization of sensors, reporting and visualization of uncertainty, appropriate lineage 
information (used data, parameters and models), as for example requested in ISO metadata, but also 
additional information in order to ensure reproducibility of presented science results. 
This need has been studied for the ocean observing community with recommendations that apply to all 
geosciences.  Just as there are now tools for the development of text-based web content, we need to develop 
tools for observation web services that fuel our earth observing systems.  Data Centers could ingest data 
from OGC Sensor Observation Services with minimal impact on the providers operations (no additional 
software to be written, no additional data service required). These data can be pulled into an archive, 
parsing metadata on the fly and populating its data bases for discoverability. Since the data and provenance 
are fully-described and integrated as a service, the records are archive-ready. Use of SensorML would 
guide manufacturers of environmental sensors to generate fully-described sensor descriptions in a 
standards-based XML encoding [Fredericks 2010]. 
In many cases key simulation codes grow organically as a new research code is added to an existing body 
of code, resulting in unsustainable applications that cannot be easily verified, where error propagation from 
one part of the code to others may not be well understood [ACCI 2011].  Developments in UnCertML and 
the UnCertWeb project have lead to methods to characterize uncertainty propagation through algorithmic 
transforms. 
 

 Increasing geoscience observations from sensors and citizens 
Sensor observations are indispensible source to enable the vision of understanding the Earth with 
EarthCube. They are capable of providing live or near-real time data to facilitate the timely monitoring of 
the Earth system. The EarthCube needs to adopt the Sensor Web concept and systems for supporting the 
discovery and access of sensor observations and ultimately providing bi-directional live connections 
between the sensors and the rest of Earth observing system of systems.  The concept of Sensor Web carries 
different meanings due to the heterogeneous background of its developments and applications. 
Nevertheless, the consensuses are that Sensor Web will make ultimate and smart connections among 
sensors and between sensors and models in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). [Di 2011] 
Beyond the standards based approach for Sensor Web Enablement, lies new technology for collecting 
observations that can inform science research. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has become a 
major resource for understanding events observed and report by many people.   With research into the 
provenance and quality, VGI may become a resource for studying some geo-phenomena. Geoscience 
provides foundation for environmental research, which naturally involves citizen efforts worldwide. 
However, collecting geo-based environmental sensitive data from volunteers’ mobile devices, for example, 
is only meaningful when the data is integrated with research-end sensor data, satellite data, and scientific 
modeling data. The integration should be building into the infrastructure at the design phase to allow us 
benefit from Citizen Science. 
Similarly the Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that will enable access to many sensors and other 
information based on Machine-to-Machine communications scaling to and beyond current web-scale 
systems.  For example, in Germany there is a public display of radiation readings, but the raw data was not 
generally available to the public. The institution in charge (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz) may have let 
certain people access that data, but there was no publicly available download. The data has been made 
available via Pachube – an IoT pioneer – to approximately 1750 real-time radiation feeds.  This is a real 
example of not only a shift in how governments are choosing to communicate and partner with their 
citizens, but of a new class of individual that has the ability and insight to leverage the Internet of Things to 
affect society in a significant and powerful way [Steinbach 2011]. 
 

 Environmental models and simulations of many different types 
Environmental models and related techniques provide an important source of information and basis of 
research relevant to EarthCube.  Many types of algorithms are included in discussions of “Models”:  global 
circulation models, geophysical models, ecology prediction models, data assimilation, ensemble 
techniques, information fusion, and data mining.  Various “model web” or “integrated model” activities 
aim to develop clarity and interoperability to this important element of CI. Fundamental to developing 
geoscience knowledge based on predictive models is to well characterize the observations and simulations 
that make predictions of physical variables.   It has been recommended that NSF should support standards 



OGC 11-145 – Cyberarchitecture for Geosciences for NSF EarthCube

development in both application specific data formats, and generic requirements for multi-scale, multi-
model integration. [ACCI 2011].” 
The many meanings of “model” need to be clarified in order that they may be used in a distributed, 
interoperable CI. Classification of models based on algorithm type has been suggested as two main 
categories: Data-Driven Model (DDM) and Physics-based Model (PBM). Classification based on user 
interaction is needed.  Large institutional models are run on a routine basis by the institution with model 
results and provenance made accessible to user for “static interaction” similar to datasets.  Cloud-based 
models allow “dynamic access” by users who can integrate multiple runs with varying inputs into their 
research methods.  As an example of the later see the species presence prediction modeling based on 
dynamic interaction to the model using a Web Processing Service [Nativi 2011]. 
 

 Geoscience workflows through mashups of web services 
 “Scientific workflows, which provide for the expression, invocation, documentation, and exchange of 
mashups, are likely to become increasingly important as both experiments and simulations become 
increasingly complex and multidisciplinary” [ACCI 2011]. 
Processing of geoscience observations consist of data collected by satellite, surface and airborne sensors 
and processing capabilities distributed a many network accessible locations.  OGC has developed standards 
that allow for geoscience processing mashups through web services: 

“The data are of multiple types including gridded and point coverages. Processing of these data 
occur at multiple points across the sensor observation-to-knowledge information flow, including 
on-board sensor processing, data re-formatting processing, and data analysis processing.  
Conducting the data flow through web services allows components to be distributed and coupled 
to form an end-to-end processing chain of services consisting of contributions from diverse and 
distributed service providers.”  [Falke 2008] 

Making data process workflow automation as part of the CI architecture is one way to control the data 
quality. As we all agree, sharing data is only the first step in this picture. Different users may get different 
results from the same data. Sharing data as well as data process workflow via workflow automation in Web 
services allows different users get the same results from the same data. Speaking from computer science 
perspective, workflow automation brings computational thinking to a whole new level. 
 

 Federated Resource Management 
As noted above, a cyberinfrastructure (CI) for geosciences will be a federation of regional CI systems.  
Federations require some degree of resource management, depending on the federation's requirements. 
While resources may typically be thought of as data, storage, servers, or network bandwidth, resources 
can also include user identity, data access privileges, collaboration environments, and policy.  In much 
the same way that common metadata schemas are necessary for data interoperability, analogous 
metadata schemas are necessary for resource interoperability, in general.  Such schemas exist for basic 
hardware resources.  Managing non-hardware resources, however, is strongly related to security, i.e., 
authentication, authorization, etc. 
Different types of federation will require different types of federation security. Very loose, informal 
federations may be built using simple, low-security mash-ups, where data and services are openly 
available.  Other federations may want at least password protection. Federations with more strict 
security requirements could require PKI certificates, Kerberos tickets, or some other form of strong 
authentication. Both passwords and certificates require some form of Identity Management.  In the case 
of federated, regional CIs, having a different user ID and password for each institution is simply not 
scalable.  Hence, the notions of federated ID management and single sign-on (SSO) have become 
essential. 
Additional topics in this area include delegation of trust – where authority to act on one’s behalf is 
temporarily delegated to another user or site – and virtual organizations (VOs) that enable role-based 
authorization to be applied across a set of users from different institutions.  Operational VO systems – 
running hundreds of VOs – are used by the European Grid Infrastructure, the Open Science Grid, the 
German D-Grid, and others, to support various experimental science user groups. Further discussion of 
these federated resource management issues, along with a survey of six existing and in-progress 
distributed computing infrastructures for geospatial remote sensing, is given in [Lee 2011]. 
 

 Flexibility to operate over different distributed computing platforms 



OGC 11-145 – Cyberarchitecture for Geosciences for NSF EarthCube

EarthCube will need to provide seamless access to science information across distributed computing 
platforms. Some previous Cyberinfrastructure developments have been based on tightly coupled APIs. 
The GeoWeb demonstrates the success of interface and encoding standards that coexist easily with 
other interfaces and encodings in a rich and diverse ecosystem of choices and capabilities. This leads 
to something like a ‘Multi-Style SOA.’  Implementation as façades provides an inherently low 
adoption threshold.  
Examples include the developments of a Linked Data Proxy to the OGC Sensor Observation Service 
(SOS), as part of general efforts on semantic enablement.  SOS was originally developed and 
published as a “key-value pair” web service binding prior to the elaboration of REST bindings.  
Recently a RESTful proxy and data model for SOS has been developed and is under consideration 
[Janowicz 2011].  Such developments are typical of how application software evolves as the 
underlying software engineering and development platforms progress.  
The cyberarchitecture must be flexible enough to operate on various distributed computing platforms, 
including cloud, cluster, and desktop environments, and should scale up or down as needed to meet the 
needs of the data size and analysis requirements. 
 

 Cyberarchitecture based on prototype-driven standards  
Systems of Systems – like EarthCube - deal with holistic solutions to implement resources interoperability 
and metadata sharing among disparate (i.e. heterogeneous and distributed) and autonomous systems. To 
address some of these interoperability challenges, the Earth science communities have been developing 
interoperability specifications by profiling international standards according to their specific domain needs. 
This has resulted in a somewhat fragmented multi-speed geosciences community, as for digital 
interoperability. The need to compare the on-going activities for disciplinary interoperability specifications 
and promote discussion forums on multi-disciplinary interoperability is clear.  The Earth and Space 
Sciences Informatics (ESSI) sections of EGU and AGU have been a focus for these discussions [Nativi 
2010]. 
Prototype-driven standards development and consensus endorsement process is a good match to the 
cautionary prescription given by the NSF ACCI report: 

“The identification of software standards that deserve to be supported is one of the roles that 
NSF’s peer-review processes can facilitate. However, today’s ad hoc and loosely coordinated 
approaches to software infrastructure allow unanticipated breakthroughs and chances for new 
ideas to arise and influence the entire cyber-ecosystem; this must not be lost in a well-meaning 
attempt to make the ecosystem more efficient through designation of approaches as preferred or 
deprecated.”  “A balance must be preserved between standardization for efficiency and flexibility 
for innovation” [ACCI 2011]. 

The transformative impact of standards on sharing and distribution of geospatial data has already been 
demonstrated in a variety of contexts.  For example, the OGC Interoperability Program has conducted 
more than eight phases of OGC Web Services (OWS) testbeds with results now in operational Earth 
observation and geoscience systems. The OGC process is one element of the Governance process 
recommended for EarthCube in a companion white paper [Arctur 2011].

Architecting EarthCube 
 What is Architecting? 

The preceding sections described elements of a Cyber-architecture suited to meet the needs of EarthCube.  
The processes and methods to build such a cyber-architecture are the topic of architecting.  Three, non-
exclusive approaches to architecting have been defined based on multiple projects [Rechtin 1991] 

o Heuristics:  Architectural rules of thumb for structuring that brings form to function 
o Stakeholders:  Process based on governance principles to meet the needs of stakeholders 
o Normative: Use and advancement of standards and reference models to guide development 

Rechtin’s text provides a rich set of heuristics that were well honed during his time of leadership at 
Aerospace Corporation.  A companion OGC white paper describes a Governance Process for evolutionary 
development of EarthCube [Arctur 2011].  The remainder of this paper suggests some starting points for 
the normative approach.   

 Science scenarios lead the way 
In order to meet its objectives, the evolutionary development of EarthCube must be science driven. A 
companion OGC white paper defines sciences scenarios describing data-intensive, cross-disciplinary 
research that illustrate the need for an open, adaptable and integrative cyberinfrastructure [Welles 2011]. 
The scenarios cover a range of topics in the Geosciences, and target current and anticipated future problems 
faced by researchers and their support systems (research centers, libraries, data centers and archives and 
commercial service providers) working to address these challenges. 

 Cyberarchitecture and Scientific Epistemology 
Development of EarthCube must build on the rapid advances in computers and computation that define 
new ways to determining how we know what we know about our world.  Computation, along with theory 
and experiment, has become the “third pillar” of science and engineering. And making new scientific 
discoveries requires the computational ability to synthesize and analyze very large data sets, integrated 
across biological,	  physical,	  and	  social	  sciences	  and	  engineering,	  and	  across	  the	  science-­‐technology	  
interface.  Hey et al. named this “data-intensive science” as the “fourth paradigm" [Hey 2009, Wright 
2011a, Benioff 2005].  While we have attained high-performance computing at affordable cost and have 
made good progress on simulation tools, many challenges remain in effectively integrating multiple field 
observatories containing thousands of instruments, involving millions of users, and petabytes of data, built 
on a true data grid with the ability to analyze data on that grid with sophisticated data analysis [Wright 
2011a, Hey 2009]. 

 Starting places for Cyber-architecture 
This paper has described some key CI aspects needed for EarthCube to meet its objectives along with an 
initial sketch of how this architecting can be done based on science leadership. Nothing like EarthCube 
exists today but some existing developments provide some starting points for describing the structures 
needed for the Cyberarchitecture of EarthCube. These documents can be used as resources for defining a 
cyber-architecture for EarthCube: 

- The OGC Reference Model (ORM) describes the OGC Standards Baseline focusing on 
relationships between the baseline documents. The OGC Standards Baseline consists of the 
approved Abstract and Implementation Standards (interface, encoding, profile, application 
schema) and Best Practices. The ORM provides just an overview of the results of extensive 
development by hundreds of OGC member organizations and tens of thousands of individuals who 
have contributed to development of the OGC Standards Baseline [Percivall 2008].     
- The GEOSS AIP Architecture defines a multi-viewpoint architecture for the exchange and 
dissemination of observational data and information in the Global Earth Observing System of 
Systems (GEOSS) [AIP 2010]. This architecture was developed and is used in the GEOSS 
Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP).  The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is 
coordinating efforts to build GEOSS through a series of Tasks. GEO’s Members include 80 
Governments and the European Commission. In addition, 58 intergovernmental, international, and 
regional organizations with a mandate in Earth observation or related issues have been recognized 
as Participating Organizations.
