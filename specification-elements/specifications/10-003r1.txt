Preface 

The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner Operator, Phase 1 (AECOO-1) Testbed 

developed and implemented methods to streamline communications between parties in the 

conceptual design phase to get an early understanding of the tradeoffs between construction cost 

and energy efficiency. To that end, the project developed the interoperability components 

required for these analyses in collaborative team settings. These were Information Delivery 

Manuals (IDMs) for quantity takeoffs and energy analysis business processes, and used these to 

define Model View Definitions (MVDs)—standards-based subsets of Industry Foundation 

Classes (IFCs). AECOO-1 was conducted in response the felt need that overall productivity loss 

and fragmentation in the capital facilities development industries is no longer tolerable. All 

stakeholders need to practice the best way they know, and practice profitably; software 

interoperability problems must not hold them back. Non-interoperable software and data is cause 

for loss of competition across the market. 

The AECOO-1 Testbed was jointly led by the buildingSMART alliance (bSa) and The Open 

Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC®). The Testbed was conducted using the OGC 

Interoperability Program Policy and Procedures for a Testbed initiative. All results of this 

Testbed have been submitted to bSa for consideration as candidate specifications and best 

practices under the National Building Information Model Standard (NBIMS) Rules of 

Governance. 

Should bSa and other AEC-related standards bodies adopt the results of AECOO-1 as approved 

standards via their respective consensus processes, then software providers will be positioned to 

provide products and services that employ these specifications to their users to streamline 

communications and information exchanges and lower risks and costs between project 

participants during the conceptual design phase of capital projects.  

The Sponsors of the AECOO-1 Testbed were:  

Architecture Firms: HOK, Burt Hill and Ellerbe Becket  

General Contractors: Webcor and Gilbane  

Government Agencies: US General Services Administration and Statsbygg (Norway)  

Trade Associations: American Institute of Architects and Large Firm Roundtable 

The main outcomes of AECOO-1 were: 

 Application of the interoperability Testbed process to the AECOO community was 
accomplished through coordination of ten sponsoring organizations. The Sponsors and four 

affiliated standards organizations developed and issued a Request for Quotation/Call for 

Participation (RFQ/CFP) released in May of 2008.  

 Twenty-seven organizations participated in some aspect of AECOO-1, including 
Sponsors and affiliated standards organizations. 

 Two Information Delivery Manuals for Energy Analysis and Quantity Takeoff were 
developed, based on the AIA Integrated Project Delivery Process. 

 Two Model View Definitions for Energy Analysis and Quantity Takeoff were developed, 
based on the AIA Integrated Project Delivery Process

 Two demonstrations that iterate through a series of changes to a ―test building‖ highlighting 
energy cost reduction (building performance) and building materials‘ quantity and cost. The 

demonstrations used a number of different software products that interchanged IFC 

information using existing commercial off-the-shelf software. 

The use of the methods and processes developed in AECOO-1 facilitate earlier understanding of 

the tradeoffs between construction quantities take off, cost, and energy efficiency. The process 

for design change, energy evaluation, and change approval were shown to reduce timeframes 

from weeks to hours. 

Chapters 1 through 5 detail the background for and work completed over the life of the Testbed. 

In Chapter 6 of the Report, we present an analysis of the work accomplished and discuss lessons 

learned.  In addition we put forward six recommendations for future progress.  Supporting these 

recommendations are two Annexes. Annex A delves more distinctly into the means for closing 

communication gaps along the AEC lifecycle. 

In late 2009 the American Institute of Architects, one of the sponsors of AECOO-1 issued a 

position request on interoperability related to project delivery.  The request suggests 

interoperability in the AEC market is best accomplished using professional, public and private-

sector adoption of open standards.  The results of the AECOO-1 Testbed are to be seen as a 

partial contribution in meeting AIA‘s position statement. The full position statement is made part 

of this Summary Report and can be found in Annex B.

Summary of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, Owner, 
Operator Testbed 1 (AECOO-1) 

The buildingSMART alliance (bSa)
1
 (a Council of the National Institute of Building Sciences) 

and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
2
 conducted a Testbed, based on OGC‘s 

Interoperability Program (IP) to develop candidate specifications and best practices to meet 

sponsor requirements. The AECOO-1 Testbed looked at streamlining communications and 

information exchanges between project participants during the criteria design phase to get an 

understanding of the tradeoffs between construction quantity take off, cost and energy efficiency. 

The OGC Interoperability Program is a global, hands-on and collaborative prototyping program 

for rapid development of proven candidate specifications. In this Testbed, international 

technology developers and providers and sponsors teamed together to solve specific AECOO 

interoperability problems posed by the initiative‘s sponsoring organizations. Testbeds and other 

Interoperability Program modes of interaction between users and developers are designed to 

encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of open, consensus-based 

standards.  

Engagement of multiple standards organizations and professional associations in a common 

Testbed activity also helps to address increasingly challenging standards issues that could not be 

solved by one organization alone.  

1 Overview 

The AECOO-1 Testbed began in July 2008 and was formally completed on May 26, 2009. Prior 

to Testbed execution was a concept development effort as well as a published Request for 

Technology (RFT) that provided interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed 

Testbed requirements prior to releasing the AECOO-1 Testbed‘s Request for Quotation/Call for 

Participation.  

There were 2 primary focus areas for AECOO-1 Testbed activity.  

First, was to provide a demonstrable and operational set of processes and procedures for bSa take 

up - to advance their mission to develop an implementable National Building Information 

Standard (NBIMS). In this Testbed, bSa and OGC were not only focusing on specific operational 

issues for how to do standards, but also to demonstrate and transfer operational processes and

standardization, and integration of building information modeling technologies to provide for full automation of the 

entire lifecycle of buildings. The alliance, in association with the American Institute of Architects and the 

Construction Specifications Institute, develops and publishes the consensus-based United States National CAD 

Standard®. The alliance also sustains the consensus-based National BIM Standard. The alliance coordinates projects 

establishing best business practices, enterprise architecture, education transformation, research and development 

throughout the industry. The alliance acts as the North American chapter of buildingSMART International a 

consortium of 30 countries with like goals. See http://www.buildingsmartalliance.org/

procedures for bSa to use as the members move forward in advancing requirements identified in 

the National Building Information Standard, Part 1, Version 1 issued in late 2007. The specific 

processes and procedures that were designed as part of this Testbed involved developing a 

standards based approach for Information Delivery Manuals, as well as for the companion 

document for Model View Definitions. In implementing these processes, bSa and OGC used 

general guidance documented throughout Chapter 5 of the NBIMS (December 7, 2007)
3
, 

combined with procedures and processes for Testbeds within OGC‘s Interoperability Program 

(see http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/policies/ippp).  

The second focus area was to apply these processes so that bSa may establish it‘s direction about 

using rapid standards development processes to foster faster, better and cheaper information 

exchanges and best practices during collaborative work inside the NBIMS program, and that can 

readily transferred to project teams using NBIMS-based software. With this in mind we applied 

these processes and procedures to advance interoperability for three areas of business and 

technical interest by the sponsors:  

 Building Performance and Energy Analysis 

 Quantity Takeoffs for Cost Estimation 

 Requests for Information (Communications Project Delivery and Decision Support).  

The first two technical areas of interest participants received sponsor funding. The final area of 

interest was only briefly explored with in-kind participation only, and was largely dealt with 

inside demonstration planning and preparation. Within this context of the work undertaken, the 

Integrated Project Delivery Process (as designed by the American Institute of Architects (AIA)) 

was used as the business cycle platform for information exchange.

1.3  Testbed Accomplishments 

 Ten sponsoring organizations defined Testbed requirements for AECOO-1. The sponsors‘ 
requirements were first documented in an RFT that was issued in February 2008. OGC 

received 20 AECOO industry responses and those responses were used as input to develop 

and publish the Request for Quotation/Call for Participation (RFQ/CFP) documents that were 

released by the OGC in May of 2008.  

 Four affiliated standards organizations provided pre RFQ/CFP advice, technical assistance. 
During the execution of the Testbed they were provided an opportunity for their membership 

to review interim documents in their various stages of drafting. Many of the four affiliated 

standards organizations regularly attended weekly conference calls for each technical thread. 

 27 organizations (including Sponsors and affiliated standards organizations) participated in 
some aspect of AECOO-1. Roles for organizations in AECOO-1 include sponsors, 

participants and information architects, building architects, cost estimators, application 

providers and building energy analysts. Additionally, many organizations were observers, as 

provided for under the OGC‘s Interoperability Program‘s Testbed Processes and Procedures. 

 Major technical achievements and demonstrations of AECOO-1 results include the 
following:

 Communications Project Delivery and Decision Support involved development of a series 
of user scenarios that enabled users and software providers to demonstrate the 

accomplishments brought forward in the BPEA and QTO threads with a test building.

 Information Delivery Manual defines the business processes and information flows for any topical issue involved 

with the design, construction and operation of a building. IDM specifies the process definition including the context 

and purpose of the exchange, the originating and consuming actors, and the information created and consumed. An 

approved IDM standard can become the basis of a contract between two parties for data interchange, thereby, 

treating information as an asset, enabling BIM-based methods, and regulating the information sharing between 

project participants. 
6
 Model View Definitions provide information to software providers so that they may satisfy business process 

information flows that are required and defined within one or more IDM‘s. MVD‘s are usually designed to be 

stakeholder specific in regard to information to be exchanged. MVDs collectively aggregate information flows 

between a sender, a receiver along with a purpose for that particular exchange. MVDs can be generic or specific to a 

data model such as IFC 2.3.

 Demonstrations and webcast: Two demonstrations were completed as part of the Testbed. 
The demonstration comprised a number of different energy and building performance 

components of the ―test building‖, the results of energy analysis using EnergyPlus and the 

effect those changes had on quantity of building materials and cost. The demonstrations used 

a number of different software vendor products that interchanged IFC information using 

existing commercial off-the-shelf software to perform the necessary calculations and results. 

The first demonstration was held in Washington at the National Building Museum in March 

of 2009. The second demonstration was via a webinar in May of 2009.  

An on-line version of the webcast demonstration is available at:

Participants in the Demonstration included the following organizations: 

 Bentley 

 Digital Alchemy 

 Faithful and Gould 

 Graphisoft 

 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 

 Nemetschek, NA

2 Interoperability in the AEC Market 

The AEC market is closely tied to global financial and real property markets. Since 2007 the 

AEC, real property and financial markets can be described as stressed and in disarray, however 

this has not impeded prospects for innovation in these large segments of the real economy. In 

fact, it is quite the opposite as we continue to witness a consistent and overarching characteristic 

of innovation in these fields of business, which is that work is increasingly focused on 

information systems that can work together, or “interoperate”
7
. 

Much has been written about the nature of and context for interoperability in the AEC market 

and many see the fractionated nature of the market to be too large a hurdle to overcome
8
. But 

                                                 
7
 Interoperability can mean different things to different people and communities. Interoperability generally is a 

property referring to the ability of diverse information systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate). 

The term as used in this Report is a technical system engineering term as well as social, political, and organizational 

factors that impact system to system performance. A distinction must be drawn between interoperability and 

interoperation, with the former referring to creating a common fabric of interaction that everyone can connect to 

equally, and the latter being defined piecewise between particular systems (often through the creation of specific 

software adapters). It is our experience that it is far easier to do interoperation first, but it is interoperability that 

builds a real commodity with maximal benefits to the market.

again, when these doubts are parsed far enough we can begin to derive an interoperability 

quotient, or IQ that technologists and practitioners alike can see from their distinct perspectives – 

that discrete components and systems, when conjoined with the ability to speak with each other, 

constructively influences the behavior of other systems and components in that market.  

In the AEC market the tiny IQ has for some time increasingly impacted the economic value of 

information that can be used across the building lifecycle. The AEC market‘s low IQ indicates 

innovations that follow conventional norms are destined to underachieve and will continue 

fostering non-value added economic cost, lost productivity and lessened competitiveness. 

Information that plays well with other information across different and competing software 

applications is quickly becoming the new metric for innovation excellence, market take up and 

revenue growth. 

Look no further than the Internet for inspiration about interoperable innovation. The 

misunderstood genius of the Internet is that interoperability makes ―networks of networks‖ 

possible. Standards that permit diverse data and applications to mingle creatively explain why 

the Internet‘s influence as a multimedia, multifunctional and multidisciplinary environment for 

innovation remains unsurpassed. Consider ―mash-ups‖ as a model: Google Maps can easily be 

mixed and mashed with property, seismic or epidemiological data to produce novel applications 

that might launch a company or an industry. Greater interoperability invites greater innovation – 

and vice versa. It is this characteristic that this Testbed and the combined efforts and 

collaboration between bSa and OGC are addressing. 

Over the last 10 years the concept of merging CAD, data management, requirements for 

extending the shelf life of information and repurposing previously collected information helped 

to create what we now know to be Building Information Model (BIM) software. A BIM is a 

digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. As such it serves as a 

shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions 

during its lifecycle from inception onward. 

Many organizations over the past 5 years have jumped on the BIM bandwagon, and to those who 

did, suddenly realized the extent to which technology, business practice and process are jointly 

and materially impacted. The business opportunity space and production possibilities curves 

when employing BIM technologies are naturally pushed out, which implies that to receive the 

maximum benefit of the technology and new applications, the idea of paving over old cow paths 

does not suffice. Inherent in this mix of integrated application software and data sharing 

capabilities is the opportunity for AEC businesses to not automate old and outmoded processes, 

but rather to evaluate and institute processes that increase efficiencies, productivity and add 

value. If BIM, through its technological advancement facilitates realizing process improvements, 

then reasonable economic and business judgments can be made about adoption. 

BIM technological components help organizations to overhaul their business processes because 

the overall scope of the technology is broad. Currently BIM can be described as a product or as 

an intelligent digital representation of data about a capital facility. BIM authoring tools 

encompass CAD and are used to create and aggregate information, which, before BIM, were 

offered as separate software with non-machine interpretable information in a paper-centric 

process.

2.1 Interoperability Standards in the BIM Marketplace 

Users also desire to extend the value proposition of BIM beyond its role as simply a product – to 

see it and use it as a mechanism to carry out collaborative processes throughout the lifecycle of 

the facility. This value proposition covers business drivers, automated process capabilities and 

other network messaging and communications advantages. Currently, the opportunities to use 

BIM as a collaborative resource are largely dependent on project team members deciding which 

single vendor software to use for that project, and this decision customarily requires additional 

investments for transfer technology (along with related financial, training and support costs). 

Forcing AEC companies to change software on a project-by-project basis, and to continuously 

invest in new software and training negatively impacts the larger gains that BIM can offer and 

often means that businesses must continuously change the way in which they operate to 

accommodate the way that particular software works on a project-by-project basis.  

So now the market is increasingly demanding that open information standards be more broadly 

applied to BIM technologies so that each partner in a project can comfortably adapt their internal 

processes, so that they can share project information across their chosen software and other 

partner‘s chosen and possibly heterogeneous software platform(s), while preserving information 

sustainability and fidelity across the lifecycle and minimizing their and their client‘s risk. This 

demand targets software providers to offer capabilities to exchange information seamlessly.  

When BIM (and all its associated data categories and attributes) is successfully standardized 

across a set of numerous, but commonly defined data and information service levels and 

shown to work in run time conditions, the full utility of the technology as a collaborative tool 

and a facility lifecycle management tool can be realized. It involves gaining agreements about 

well-understood information exchanges, workflows, and procedures at not only the human level, 

but also the machines human use - where teams use and rely on repeatable, verifiable, 

transparent, and sustainable information throughout the building lifecycle. 

Thus, the basic premise of standards for BIM is to foster collaboration by different stakeholders 

at different phases of the lifecycle of a facility to insert, extract, update, or modify information in 

their software of choice and to support and reflect the roles of that stakeholder no matter what 

provider‘s software is used by any member in a project team. When BIM software from any 

provider can be thought of and used as a shared digital representation founded on open standards 

we then have achieved a level of interoperability like that suggested on page 7.  

The National BIM Standard promotes the idea of the market undertaking and defining business 

requirements for standards that can result in interoperable software across the market. Software 

interoperability is seamless data exchange at the software level among diverse applications, each 

of which may have its own internal data structure. Interoperability is achieved by mapping parts 

of each participating application‘s internal data structure to a standards-based data model and 

vice versa. If the employed standards-based data model is open, any application provider can 

participate in the mapping process and thus become interoperable with any other application 

provider‘s offering that participated in the mapping. Interoperability eliminates the costly 

practice of integrating every application (and version) with every other application (and version). 

The NBIM Standard maintains that viable software interoperability in the capital facilities 

industry requires the acceptance of an open data model and the use of service interfaces 

contained within provider‘s software to bring the capabilities of the data model to workflows 

within the project delivery work cycle. If the data model is accepted as the lingua franca and

  10 

industry-wide means of communication and can be represented in its appropriate parts along the 

entire facility lifecycle, then every software application used across the lifecycle can become 

interoperable. 

 

3 An Architecture for Interoperable Project Delivery 

Given the mix of technical and business issues confronting the AEC market and the potential 

benefits interoperability through standards offers, the goal of AECOO-1 was to develop a 

process for standards development whereby more efficient sharing of building information 

between participants in a project team, and between the heterogeneous software products they 

use can be realized.  

In the Concept Development stage of AECOO-1 (development of and comments on the RFT), 

we found that most of the industry that responded thought information sharing about buildings as 

an issue that involved transmitting complete information about a building between two design 

software packages. However, once a discussion on this topic was initiated during the kickoff 

meetings and later parts of the Testbed execution phase, we found that design-software-to-

design-software was the least useful information sharing case to address. In the course of a 

design project, there is little need to share all aspects of the design between project participants. 

What is more important is to exchange relevant elements of the design between the lead 

architecture firm or lead general contractor and subcontractors with specific expertise in areas 

such as lighting, energy usage, building cost, HVAC, circulation, etc.  

3.1 Elements of BIM Standards for Interoperability 

The design elements needed by these specialists are highly diverse, and so is the software they 

use to do their jobs. AECOO-1 found that there are few, if any, standard business practices 

addressing fundamental information exchange requirements between the design team and area 

specialists. Technology cannot provide solutions until the business practices are firmly in place. 

This is why the information sharing challenge has been so difficult to solve, and many in the 

industry feel that technology standards efforts have not been as successful as they should. 

Therefore, in order to make progress on the technology front, AECOO-1 also had to advance the 

process for developing business information practices associated with sponsor requirements.  

The National Building Information Model Standard, Part 1, Version 1 provided us with the 

concepts of an Information Delivery Manual (IDM), which articulates what building information 

is required to accomplish a particular specialty analysis (e.g. lighting design, energy 

performance, materials cost, etc.), and a Model View Definition (MVD), which is the smallest 

set of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) that are needed to express the information 

requirements of a particular IDM. We found that specialists do their work to varying degrees of 

specificity depending on how fully developed the building model is at a point in time. In other 

words, the accuracy of the lighting study, energy analysis, or cost estimate changes as the design 

evolves. 

It is impossible to create software that will work as needed with any building at every stage of 

design, so our task became one of limiting the degrees of freedom in the design process so that 

software designers have a reasonable expectation of how much detail and definition they can 

expect to find in a building at a particular stage of design.  



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  11 

AECOO-1 made two significant contributions in this area. First, we agreed upon a universal 

definition of project phases, and what level of detail was captured in building design at each 

project phase
9
. This was a critical first step to characterize what information could be expected to 

be present—and therefore what types of analyses could be performed—at a particular stage of 

design. Second, we brought into the discussion the groups responsible for standardizing 

nomenclature for building materials and other aspects of the design process such as the 

Construction Specification Institute‘s OmniClass and Uniformat nomenclatures. Utilizing 

standard definitions of building materials, sizes, etc., is a prerequisite for creating standardized 

design interchange files in a standard data model for AEC – Industry Foundation Class (IFC) 

format. This aspect of standardization will need to occur often within the NBIMS process going 

forward. It is a conclusion implied in NBIMS Version 1, Part 1 and now verified by work done 

in AECOO-1. 

With our analysis of information flows from the business perspective of the sponsor‘s 

requirements complete, we could then apply what was learned to the technology realm. The 

essential steps taken are graphically depicted in Figure 2. Following the figure we explore in 

more detail the actual activities that were undertaken.

being codified in IDMs and MVDs 

3.2 Interoperability Standards for Business Practices and Design Maturity 

There is currently little standardization of the stages of design maturity during a project lifecycle, 

and therefore it is difficult to develop software that can work generically with any building. 

Therefore our first task of limiting the degrees of design freedom was to pick a project stage, and

define fully what design information would be present in the IDM for the building model at any 

stage.  

We chose to work at the conceptual design stage, as this is the point in time at which significant 

changes can still be made to positively impact cost, energy performance, and other key factors 

that inform final design. This choice resulted in the following definition of early, or conceptual 

design: 

 Level of Detail 200: Approximate geometry10 

Design & Coordination (function / form / behavior): Generic elements shown in three 

dimensions (maximum size, purpose). 

Authorized use for 4D Scheduling: Time-scaled, ordered appearance of detailed 

assemblies. 

Authorized use for Cost Estimating: Estimated cost based on measurement of generic 

elements (e.g. generic interior wall). 

Authorized use for Program Compliance: Specific room requirements. 

Authorized use for Environmental (lighting, energy use, air movement 

Analysis/Simulation): Conceptual design based on geometry and assumed system 

types. 

With this definition in place, we could then begin to define the information requirements for the 

IDMs that would support our two target business cases, energy performance and materials cost 

estimation. And then it became a simple matter to create the MVDs (see Figure 3 below) that 

defined what IFCs were needed to articulate the IDMs. The software vendors could then write 

code to translate their internal, proprietary building information models into interchangeable IFC 

models for energy analysis at the conceptual design stage, and materials cost estimation at the 

early design stage.  

For perspective, creating the definition of conceptual design took about 2 project months, and the 

IDMs took 2-3 project months. The MVD creation took less than 2 weeks, and the actual 

software development amongst the participating providers took under 2 months.  

This underlines strongly the importance of having the industry agree to standardized business 

practices before we can have any hope of standardized information flows between software 

packages. This was by far the most important lesson of AECOO-1.

4 AECOO-1 Threads and Work Areas 

The development of the AECOO-1 Testbed was organized around the following 3 threads: 

 Building Performance and Energy Analysis (BPEA) 

 Quantity Takeoff for Cost Estimation (QTO) 

 Communications Project Delivery and Decision Support (CPD) 

A summary of each thread is provided below.

4.1 IDM For Building Performance and Energy Analysis (BPEA) 

Energy analysis is concerned with predicting the usage profile and cost of energy consumption 

within buildings. Conceptual design phase energy modeling is used to provide the design team 

with first order of magnitude feedback about the impact of various building configurations on 

annual energy performance. Conceptual phase energy modeling requires the designer to make 

assumptions for a wide of range of simulation input if information is not yet available. It takes 

into account as input data: 

 Building geometry including the layout and configuration of spaces, 

 Building orientation, 

 Building construction including the thermal properties of all construction elements including 
walls, floors, roofs/ceilings, windows, doors, and shading devices, 

 Building usage including functional use, 

 Internal loads and schedules for lighting, occupants, and equipment, 

 Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system type and operating characteristics, 

 Space conditioning requirements, 

 Utility rates, and 

 Weather data. 

The output results of energy analysis may include:  

 Assessment of the space and building energy performance for compliance with regulations 
and targets, 

 Overall estimate of the energy use by space and for the building and an overall estimate of 
the energy cost, 

 Time based simulation of the energy use of the building and time based estimate of utility 
costs, and 

 Lifecycle estimate of the energy use and cost for the building.  

For the purposes of this process map, conceptual phase energy analysis is considered to include 

the assessment of heating and cooling demand within a building during peak periods. 

Various types of analyses are within the scope of this process map, including: 

 Setting comfort criteria for spaces including minimum and maximum required indoor air 
temperatures (summer and winter), minimum fresh air requirements, 

 Heat loss/gain calculations using well defined analytical methods, 

 Energy performance rating system and/or energy code requirement compliance, 

 Analysis of energy consumption in meeting the building energy demands, and 

 Optimization of energy performance related to equipment or system type and related 
equipment/system performance characteristics considering lifecycle cost, environmental 

impact issues, and comfort aspects.  

4.1.1 Cyclical Design 

Energy analysis is now a critical path workflow throughout the design stages of a project. Two 

key parts of energy analysis were considered in the Testbed: 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  15 

4.1.1.1 Conceptual Design 

This is the analysis work undertaken during the programming and concept design stage of the 

project. It is about providing advice on the potential energy performance of a building and its 

systems to other design roles. The aim of this analysis is to have an impact on the overall 

building design, determine the feasibility of concepts in an energy context and to establish 

energy targets. Conceptual analysis may be undertaken in the absence of detailed geometric 

information about the building layout, though frequently general spatial layout is included during 

this stage. The designer is more concerned with relative performance values between the design 

options being considered, rather than absolute performance values. Though assumptions 

typically must be made at this stage, maintaining consistent assumptions between the options 

being evaluated allows for relative performance to be evaluated. 

4.1.1.2 Detailed Design 

This is the analysis work undertaken during the schematic and design development stages of the 

project and assumes the availability of geometric and building system information for the design. 

The overall process is the same at each stage of work, the difference being simply about the 

extent of the information available and the level of certainty that can be applied to the 

information. These factors impact the analysis methods used, which may range from relatively 

simple at the earlier design stages to detailed dynamic simulations at the later design stages. 

Within this process map, the conceptual design phase for Building Performance and Energy 

Analysis is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 - Concept Design Phase Energy Analysis 

4.1.2 IDM BPEA Information Exchanges  

For Conceptual Design, the scope of the exchange of information is primarily about spaces with 

associated energy information and about proposed energy analysis zones. The purpose of the 

exchange requirement is to support the coordination of energy analysis requirements with 

general in building zoning and spacing requirements. Information requirements were defined as 

―required‖ or ―optional‖. Data parameters and units of measurement were also defined. Also it 

was presumed that information exchanges took place between the role of Architect and a 

Mechanical Engineer and/or Energy Consultant. 

The exchange requirement assumes that a building model is available from which relevant 

geometric information required for energy analysis can be derived. It is anticipated that the 

building model will provide context information about the project including units to be used, 

coordinate systems to be adopted and the direction of true north.  

The building model will provide specific information about: 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  17 

 The building, its location, composition, overall shape and orientation 

 The shape and location of adjacent buildings to enable shading effects to be determined 

 Building stories within the building 

 Spatial configuration 

Information that is provided by this exchange is to enhance the initial set of building model 

information including: 

 Space type and function identification with type data being obtained from a project space 
type library (which is in turn derived from an industry space type library). This data will 

drive assumptions on internal loads, conditioning requirements, etc. 

 Building elements construction type data with type data being obtained from a project 
construction type library (which is in turn derived from a industry construction type library). 

This data will provide information on the thermal characteristics of the building envelope and 

internal constructions. 

 Space boundaries that define the relation between spaces and building elements and the 
geometry that describes the space boundary connection. 

 Energy targets. 

 HVAC zoning, day lighting, and the use of photovoltaics. 

For energy simulation and analysis, the scope is about the exchange of information related to 

energy demand, comfort, and annual energy consumption. The purpose of the exchange 

requirement is to enable coordination of energy analysis with other design roles based on the 

results of energy analysis and the ability to comply with set energy targets. The exchange 

requirement assumes that information about the building has been satisfied.  

Information that is provided by this exchange requirement to includes: 

 Ventilation requirements, 

 Peak thermal loads,  

 Energy demand, 

 Annual energy consumption, 

 Utility rates, and 

 Energy costs.

4.1.3 2nd Level Space Boundaries 

At the Conceptual Design level of the building process as defined by IPD, the notion of space 

boundaries
11

 plays a role in energy analysis and quantity takeoff for cost estimation. There are 

defined three levels of space boundaries. The IDM developed in the BPEA Thread accounts for 

the first level. To provide for a more complete energy analysis and cost estimation, 2
nd

 level 

space boundaries need to be calculated and work to define this component for conceptual design 

energy analysis was initiated in the Testbed.  

4.1.3.1 Ist Level Space Boundaries 

1
st
 level space boundaries are the boundaries of a space defined by the surfaces of building 

elements bounding this space (physical space boundaries) or by virtual surfaces provided by an 

adjacent space with no dividing wall. Other characteristics that are part of a 1
st
 level space 

boundary include: 

 1st level space boundaries do not consider any change of material in the bounding building 
elements, or different spaces/zones behind a wall or slab (floor or ceiling). 

 1st level space boundaries are differentiated in two ways: virtual or physical and internal or 
external.  

 1st level space boundaries form a closed shell around the space (so long as the space is 
completely enclosed) and include overlapping boundaries representing openings (filled or 

not) in the building elements (see implementers agreement below). 

 Implementers' Agreements --  

Connection geometry for 1
st
 level space boundaries may contain arcs (i.e. creating 

cylindrical surfaces), or polygons (i.e. creating extruded surfaces with orientation 

changes). 

1
st
 level space boundaries representing building elements (wall, slabs, columns, beams) 

do not include inner loops to create voids (e.g. for openings). Instead, there are 

separate 1
st
 level space boundaries representing such openings (with or without 

contained doors and windows) -- which overlap and are coplanar with the space 

boundaries representing the host wall, slab, column, or beam.  

 

 

                                                 
11

 Space boundaries are virtual objects used to calculate quantities for various forms of analysis related to spaces or 

rooms in buildings. Analyses that use space boundaries include:  Quantity takeoff for Cost Estimating – In early 

stages of design, many objects have not yet been modeled. In this phase of a project, space boundaries (and other 

measurements based on the space object) are used to estimate such things as finish materials (i.e. carpeting, tile, 

paint) and casework. Facilities Management Work Package Estimating – During the operations phase of a building‘s 

life cycle, space boundaries can be used to estimate areas for facilities management work packages such as re-

painting, carpet cleaning, and cleaning of other building element surfaces. Energy Analysis – that is, estimating the 

amount of energy that will be used by a building during operation. Space boundaries need to be calculated to capture 

more accurate energy flow between a space and other spaces or the outside air.

4.1.3.2 2nd Level Space Boundaries 

2
nd

 level space boundaries still represent building elements that bound the space, but are more 

granular in that they are subdivided in any of the following cases: 

 Contained openings (with or without fillings like doors and windows) 

 Differences in materials and/or material assemblies (e.g. a wainscote or paneling on the 
lower portion of a wall). 

 Differences in spaces or zones on the other side of the building element (or virtual boundary) 
represented by the space boundary (e.g. two different spaces on the other side of a wall) 

 Differentiation between physical / virtual boundaries and internal / external boundaries is the 
same as for 1

st
 level space boundaries.  

 2nd level space boundaries represent both sides of a heat transfer surface separated by the 
thickness of the building element. They can be used by thermal analysis software, but 

require, that the two adjacent surfaces are found and be combined to form a single heat 

transfer surface. This is required even where the two surfaces are of different length (e.g. 

non-rectangular wall connections and curved walls). See also 3rd level space boundaries. 

 2nd level space boundaries (including the 3rd level subtype described below) form a closed 
shell around the space (so long as the space is completely enclosed).  

 Implementers' Agreements -- 

The connection geometry of 2
nd

 level space boundaries is restricted to planar surfaces 

only. This means that curved surfaces must be segmented. 

The connection geometry of 2
nd

 level space boundaries of walls/slabs/columns/beams and 

included openings/doors/windows do not overlap. 

4.1.3.3 3rd Level Space Boundaries 

3
rd

 level space boundaries are special types of 2
nd

 level space boundaries.  

 Type 3a - The most common type occurs where the element behind the boundary is a 
building element, rather than a space or zone. For example: the end of a wall (wall butt) that 

divides two spaces on the other side of a wall.  

 Type 3b - a second type occurs where path based building elements intersect and overlap. 

 Type 3c - The third type occurs at non-orthogonal intersections of building elements where 
the two sides of the element have different lengths (e.g. angled wall connections). The extra 

length on one side or the other is defined to be a 3
rd

 level space boundary. 

 3rd level space boundaries are typically ignored in heat transfer calculations for energy 
analysis because the transfer in these cases is negligible. Identification of such boundaries, as 

3
rd

 level, enables energy analysis software to ignore them. 

 The combination of 2nd level and 3rd level space boundaries form a closed shell around the 
space (so long as the space is completely enclosed). 

 Similar to 1st and 2nd level space boundaries, 3rd level space boundaries are a differentiation 
into virtual or physical and internal or external space boundaries. 

 Implementers' Agreements --

only (same as for 2nd level). This means that curved surfaces must be segmented. 

The connection geometry of 3
rd

 level space boundaries of walls/slabs/columns/beams and 

included openings/doors/windows do not overlap (same as for 2

 level). 

The Implementation Guide developed as part of this Testbed and completed under further 

USGSA guidance defines a stepwise approach for calculating space boundaries in buildings. A 

companion MVD provides software developers the means for implementation in software using 

IFC structured data. 

4.1.4 MVD For Building Performance and Energy Analysis (BPEA) 

Two MVD‘s were constructed for the BPEA IDM: a Generic and a Model View Binding for IFC 

2.3 version along with an Implementation Guide. 

The Generic Model View presents a collection of diagrams documenting the concepts based on 

the Exchange Requirements defined in the Information Delivery Manual (IDM). Note that 

generic concepts are documented and cataloged in the MVD coordination database for reuse 

across multiple MVDs.  

The Model View Binding presents a collection of diagrams documenting how each generic 

concept will be represented in the IFC 2.3 information model schema to be used for the exchange 

Binding concepts are documented and cataloged in the MVD coordination database for reuse in 

multiple MVDs that will use the same schema for exchange for other MVDs using IFC 2.3.  

The Implementation Guide provides instructions for programmers about how to implement 

specific concepts defined in the IDM and includes 3 parts: 

 Data instantiation diagrams - These diagrams document the exact information model entities 
that will be used to represent the concept (e.g. IfcObject) and parameters that must be used 

(e.g. property values), 

 Implementer agreements - Generally, these are agreed limitations to be used in this 
representation of the concept where the underlying information model schema would allow a 

broader range of possibilities (e.g. agreement to use 3D facet geometry where the schema 

would allow for other types of 3D geometry). 

 Reference data - in many cases, an MVD will make use of existing industry standards to 
define value ranges (e.g. classification systems or enumerations defined in a reference 

standard). If the exchange only allows values from such a reference standard, a URL or 

information sufficient to access that reference standard will be provided.  

4.2 IDM For Quantity Takeoff for Cost Estimation (QTO) 

Quantity Take-Off is a precursor to completing a cost estimate to determine whether the design 

meets the project budget. In the early design (conceptual) design phase, quantities used for 

estimating are building or elemental level quantities as more detailed design information are not 

available. For example, the conceptual phase allows: 

 Walls and slabs by area, 

 Windows by count by size, 

 Spaces by area, 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  21 

 Structural system by facility area, 

 Heating system by facility area, 

 Cooling system by facility area, 

The output of the quantity take-off may be the result of a report produced by the cost estimating 

application, which shows quantities. Other than a valid IFC file for use by cost estimating 

applications, the QTO process does not produce any output. 

Throughout the estimating process the estimator typically communicates through various media 

with the design team, and perhaps the owner, to understand the design intent fully providing an 

appropriate estimate of building costs. Often, this post model output interaction among the 

various actors / roles is not captured formally. For Communication, Process and Decision (CPD) 

Making functionality, the BIM must be able to document the actors / roles interacting with the 

model. The various actors and roles mentioned specifically in the IDM are not indicative of all 

potential actors / roles at early design stages. 

4.2.1 Cyclical Design 

The process of outputting a quantity take-off is cyclical to match the design submittal 

requirements. It supports the cost estimating requirements to verify that the project design is 

within the established budget. The quantity take-off will have increasing complexity as the 

design progresses from early concept through final design. 

4.2.1.1 Conceptual 

This is the analysis work undertaken during the programming and concept design stage of the 

project. It is about providing advice on the potential construction cost of a building to design 

roles and the client. The aim of this analysis is to determine the feasibility of concepts in a 

capital cost context. Conceptual analysis may be undertaken in the absence of detailed geometric 

information about the building layout, though frequently general spatial layout is included during 

this stage. Assumptions typically must be made at this stage, maintaining consistent assumptions 

between the options being evaluated allows for evaluation of relative cost performance. 

4.2.1.2 Detailed 

This is the analysis work undertaken during the schematic; design development and construction 

document stages of the project and assumes the availability of geometric and building system 

information for the design. The overall process is the same at each stage of work, the difference 

being simply about the extent of the information available and the level of certainty that can be 

applied to the information. These factors impact the analysis methods used, which may range 

from relatively simple area and elemental quantities at the earlier design stages to detailed 

quantity take-off at the later design stages. 

Within this process map below, the conceptual design phase of the project is shown. The process 

map generically refers to the Design Team, Client – Client Staff and Client – Technical Staff or 

Consultants. For CPD integration, OmniClass Table 33 Disciplines provides a classification for 

the actors and OmniClass Table 34 Organizational Roles provides a classification for the roles. 

Any specific project team may require expanding the generic roles shown in process map to 

define in greater detail the actors and roles of the project.

4.4 Communications Project Delivery and Decision Support (CPD) 

This thread involved the development of a series of user scenarios and situations that enabled 

users and software providers to demonstrate the accomplishments brought forward in the BPEA 

and QTO threads with a test building. It involved the development of the test building in multiple 

provider BIMs, a charrate that involved making changes to the building that impact energy 

performance, quantities and costs.

5 Demonstrations and Webcast 

Two demonstrations were completed as part of the AECOO-1 Testbed. The demonstrations 

comprised a number of different energy and building performance components of the ―test 

building‖, the results of energy analysis using EnergyPlus and the effect those changes had on 

quantity of building materials and cost. The demonstrations used a number of different software 

vendor products that interchanged IFC information using existing commercial off-the-shelf 

software to perform the necessary calculations and results. The first demonstration was held in 

Washington at the National Building Museum in March of 2009. The second demonstration was 

via a webinar in May of 2009.  

A streaming webcast of the May 28 AECOO-1 webinar is available for review: 

http://www.opengeospatial.org/pub/www/aecoo-1/index.html.  

The webcast demonstrates results from the AECOO (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, 

Owner and Operator industry) Phase 1 Testbed.  

The demonstrations focus on early design for a new building. The owner of the new building is 

interested to explore more energy efficient design alternatives and to have the building perform 

more cost effectively for the next 30 years.  

The owner hires a design team composed of architecture firm and a general contractor, 

mechanical engineer and other professionals to conduct conceptual and early design services 

with the objective exploring these facets as part of the overall design process. In preliminary 

scoping meetings with the architect and general contractor team an established working budget 

was established. The building owner enters into an Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) contract 

with the architecture firm and general contractor to develop a schematic design package for the 

building. The architecture firm/general contractor is tasked to evaluate several design 

alternatives, providing estimates of energy performance, quantities and cost related to those 

design alternatives. This input will allow the owner to calculate a return-on-investment for the 

project, and predict long-term building operating costs. Given that this is early design, the 

schematic design package and work to be undertake is to better understand cost and explore cost 

in terms of LEED building certification with relative performance options rather than absolute 

values 

The iterative process of design, energy analysis, cost estimation and owner analysis that was 

used in the demonstration is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 – AECOO-1 Demonstration flow of events 

 

The demonstration highlighted four important conclusions of the Testbed: 

 Technology standards for interoperability provide a compelling approach for addressing 
owners' business requirements for better communication, process management, decision 

support and performance simulation of design alternatives; 

 Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is realizable with interoperable technologies that enable 
faster, cheaper, and more effective information processes; 

 Project design teams can bring both energy and economic impact analysis upstream (i.e., 
earlier phases of design) using software that can seamlessly exchange data among 

different vendors' building information model (BIM) software applications, such as BIM 

authoring tools, quantity takeoff, value engineering, energy simulation, project and 

document management, and decision support; and 

 Multidisciplinary project teams that work together with data-sharing tools and common 
information models can indeed achieve better results faster than teams each working in 

their respective stovepipe application settings. 

The exchange of data using IFCs was accomplished as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 – IFC Data Exchange in Demonstration 

The process and software of the demonstrations prove that the following are achievable today: 

a) Quantitative cost and performance justification of design decisions early in the design 

process, resulting from parallel, partially automated and near-real-time cost estimating and 

building energy performance simulation; 

b) Standardized process definition that indentifies tasks and information requirements for all 

participants and stakeholders, and unambiguously defines all data exchange requirements across 

the process; 

c) Effective electronic information management and dissemination that serves all processes 

and project participants and stakeholders; and 

d) Limited use of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC - ISO Standard 16739). 

6 Lessons Learned & Recommendations 

AECOO-1 provided bSa and OGC with a Petri dish in which to experiment with proven 

approaches to standards development that are recognized globally as efficient, capable and 

targeted and apply them to AEC market requirements. Given we were integrating a Testbed 

process designed for rapid development of web services standards to the AEC market we draw 

some conclusions for further discussion and follow-on testing by members of both organizations. 

6.1 The Dimensions of BIM – Product, File and Conceptual  

The belief that a Building Information Model is a way to organize information over the course of 

that facility‘s lifecycle is accepted in the market. The belief that BIM can and should be the 

single, unifying resource for a project is a key and essential conceptual objective going forward 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:

for market efficiency is also accepted, but the idea that a BIM for any single project or portfolio 

of projects can be explicitly represented by s single data model, file type and/or single vendor 

software or suite of software packages is unrealistic.  The AIA in its recent position statement
12

 

about interoperability aptly describes today‘s situation: 

Not all architects (or consultants, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers or owners) use the 

same software packages for their work, nor should they: each should use the best tool for 

the job in their particular business enterprise. But industry stakeholders do not work in a 

vacuum: they must share information in order to complete projects, and the amount of 

necessary information sharing is increasing at a dramatic pace…  

There are many dimensions to the data or information contained in software packages 

used in the AEC industry today. Begin by considering a building information model: 

every single object in a model has dozens or hundreds of discrete pieces of associated 

alphanumeric or geometric data. Multiply that by the hundreds or thousands of objects in 

the model. Then layer on possible other uses of the data beyond the model, like 

performance analysis of the design (structural, thermal, lighting, etc.), project 

management, estimating or facility management software, or sharing of the data between 

different BIM applications, and so on. Acknowledge that some of the data is time-

sensitive and may change over the life of the model. The complexity of ensuring those 

hundreds of thousands of pieces of data be shared between packages in an accurate, 

consistent, complete and effective fashion, especially when one acknowledges the 

proprietary nature of the software packages, is mind-boggling. 

The areas of expertise that flow into the design, development, and execution of a building project 

and/or a portfolio of properties are so diverse and distinctive that the industry must continue to 

plan for a scenario where firms use the best software for the particular job at hand, whether that 

job is design, energy utilization, project management, RFI tracking, code compliance, etc.  

We now witness products being offered as BIM by individual vendors that offer users an array of 

one-stop, integrated offerings, often tied together by a proprietary data model(s) to support the 

full range of requirements identified above.  

We also must acknowledge that due, in part to the lack of widely accepted and used application 

and data interoperability processes that are standardized across the marketplace, vendors and 

users have developed symbiotic relationships to satisfy business practice.  

Finally, we need to acknowledge that a standard information model for building information 

classes is available.  This standard, while still evolving to capture new requirements, has not 

been seen as an adoptable counter response to current vendor and user relationships and the 

perceived efficiencies of proprietary data structures. For the most part the standard is treated as 

more of an exotic framework for information exchange than as market driven best practice. The 

buildingSMART alliance and the NBIMS project exist to correct these market failures and raise 

awareness about the negative impacts and costs vendor lock-in creates throughout the market, 

and undertake necessary at the standards level for the market to gain the confidence and

experience the benefits open standards information exchange provides not unlike in other fields 

such as emergency response, geospatial information, finance and healthcare. 

We begin by accepting that BIM is a concept, not a product per se, nor a single file type that can 

be stored in a database or on a hard drive. The BIM is the digital representation of a project. 

Therefore, it is unreasonable to ever expect the whole BIM to be interoperable, and exchanged 

between software packages. The BIM is distinctive, and unique to every project.  

Recommendation: bSa and allied national and international standards bodies should clarify 

market confusion regarding the term BIM, and set out in well defined, well coordinated and 

understandable ways to define the full utility of BIM and BIM-related standards and to shift 

providers business practices to deliver market driven, standards-based collaboration and 

facility lifecycle management tools.  The next two recommendation define a way forward for 

achieving this end state. 

Recommendation: Standards for BIM exist in piece parts; there is no underlying base that 

serves as the foundation for information exchange. Architecting (in the information sense) 

where BIM standards are needed should start with abstract concepts using well-known 

methods for Reference Architecture and Reference Model
13

.  Key assumptions to be defined 

include resources that are distributed across ownership boundaries, people and systems 

interactions, security, management and governance.  Interactions between people and systems 

is primarily through exchange of messages with reliability that is appropriate for the intended 

users and purposes.  

Recommendation: The essence of information standards for BIM (and all its associated data 

categories and attributes) is based on 1) standards bodies organizational structures whose 

focus are responsibility for elements of the types of architectures listed above; and 2) 

development of “successful” standardized business practices and modeled information 

exchanges. (Successful is meant to mean that the practices and exchanges are connected 

across a set of numerous, but commonly defined data and information service levels and 

shown to work in run time condition). 

6.2 Information Interoperability and Data Exchange Across BIM 

Information interoperability needs to occur when two people using different software need to 

communicate effectively and efficiently. This idea may seem simplistic, but it helps clarify and 

constrain the problem. A structural steel cost estimator doesn‘t need the entire BIM to do his/her 

work. In fact, it would be a waste of money for the cost estimation software vendor to build 

whole BIM support into their product, and if they did, every time that BIM was delivered to the 

estimator and brought into the costing software, more money would be wasted carrying around 

information that had no bearing on the problem at hand.

Recommended Practice for Architecture Description of Software-Intensive Systems. Within IEEE parlance, this is a 

Recommended Practice, the least normative of the kinds of IEEE standards. In 2007 this standard was adopted by

faq.html. 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:

Lesson: What the industry must focus on- if an information architecture framework is agreed 

to be found necessary and then developed- is creating as part of that architecture an 

interoperability layer for major processes, or sub-tasks, that are common to every building 

project, and require information exchange between specialized software packages (whether 

between firms or within the same firm). The IDM as was constructed for topics in the 

AECOO-1 Testbed begins to fulfill this role  

The interoperability challenge can therefore be described as the ability to extract the smallest, 

most directly relevant information required to execute a particular task, and share that 

information in a manner that is understandable by a wide range of users that use a wide range of 

software packages. This information will come from a BIM, but the BIM is conceptual, and parts 

of it may (and usually do) reside in a host of different software database and application systems, 

but the BIM and its conceptual requirements are likely to be needed where combinations of 

design, project management, and communications management (e.g. email or Microsoft 

Outlook) software are in constant use. 

Lesson: Migrating the requirements of IDM into interoperability standards that can be 

implemented by providers happens in the MVD.  Once an IDM is agreed to the process for 

bringing those practices and exchanges into the world of software is fairly straight forward. 

This interoperability level for BIM information exchange is called a Model View Definition 

(MVD) level in buildingSMART parlance. MVDs match up with project functions horizontally 

and vertically in the AEC lifecycle. We do not see a need to make any one provider‘s BIM 

package and related offerings interoperable with other providers, except at the point where the 

MVDs are constructed for purposes of information exchange. When well-devised business 

practices and processes are articulated in strong Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs) as were 

developed in this Testbed, good MVDs can be created. And only then can interoperability be 

expected from software providers.  

Testing software providers‘ implementations of MVDs should be built into the standards 

development process, and should take place before an MVD is approved. The exchange 

requirements documented in one or more IDMs and their corresponding MVD may also need to 

be re-examined during testing. 

There are sets of MVDs that persist along the entire lifecycle, such as cost. Cost information is 

the business of every stakeholder along the lifecycle. However, given the latitude and approaches 

that cost estimators play at any given point, it may well be more efficient to provide a cost 

estimator with tools that best enable their individual processes and choices. The issue of 

messaging about cost information, and the ability to view that information along with supporting 

attributes in other application‘s environments is the distinguishing interoperability requirement. 

6.3 The BIM Concept Needs a Message-based, Web Services Approach 

This Testbed showed what is possible when MVDs are shared between parties using file 

exchange via project management software, or simply email. The next step is to pass messages 

that can act as a means for access, display, edit and seamless integration. So, in considering what 

needs to be accomplished by the market over the coming years are: 

1. An agreement on an information architecture that encourages stakeholders to have 
conversations among and between project team members with messaging. 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  29 

2. A standards-based means for enabling messages to pass between the systems of 
application providers in accordance with MVD requirements. 

Recommendation: IFC is currently the lingua franca of MVD. Migrating from the file-based 

nature of IFC to a messaging context about project details, management and coordination is 

what BIM information architecture is about. With this focus the enormity of the job is brought 

down several notches in scale. 

The market seems ready and willing to embrace an IT message-based architecture for the AEC 

market that is purpose based, and matches the way people in the market want to work. There is 

room for a shared vision, which resides in the databases of each provider, and provides any 

stakeholder the ability to view their concept of those databases depending on their respective 

expertise and responsibility. Conversations can then happen between organizations and 

individuals at the MVD level of detail. 

6.4 IFC Should Be XML 

The market will eventually need to decide whether it wishes to pass files via Express or pass 

messages via XML. Each requires different skill sets and industry architecture. Maintaining both 

requires providers to maintain two standards based libraries. Providers currently support both 

their internal data structure libraries as well as IFC/Express. Currently, IFC is seen as an exotic 

format for providers to maintain and is not present in their core product offerings. Continuing to 

rely on Express raises the probability that attribute data needed for information fidelity, using 

IFC will continue to be marginalized. 

The industry is already moving towards the exclusive use of XML for standards. Efforts with 

good momentum include Green Building XML (gbXML), Automating Equipment Information 

Exchange (AEX), aecXML, agcXML and Open Building Information Xchange (oBIX). XML 

encodings such as those listed above are ready made for web services integration to BIM 

software. Technically speaking, the Express language could be used to pass information in a web 

services environment, but it is a poor fit and insufficient mainstream market adoption. XML is 

designed to work with web services, and there is a wealth of mature supporting software and 

software standards to facilitate the adoption of existing AEC-based XML encodings and schema 

with existing web services standards to adapt AEC software offerings. Simply put, Express 

creates an extra cost barrier whose value is questionable at best. 

If IFC classes are to become a widely used and accepted industry standard, then the viewpoint of 

them being seen as exotic will need to end, and that signal can only come from the market. If that 

signal does appear, then interest and resources from the wider IT industry will be stimulated to 

address, maintain and further enhance interoperable open data models. 

Leadership from the IT industry will also be helpful so that the myriads of attribute data products 

from groups such as the Construction Specification Institute (e.g., OmniClass) can be rapidly 

built out for software adoption using agreed upon transport and messaging frameworks.  

In the demonstration, participants stretched their respective internal IFC toolboxes to enable 

slightly more interoperability among their proprietary BIM software applications and data 

processing engines. In doing so, the teams discovered that some aspects of the IFC data model 

are not amenable for interoperability as the word is commonly defined and practiced by 

industrial communities that rely on collaboration via network processing, cloud computing, and 

distributed data repositories to achieve results for decision support faster. 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  30 

Recommendation: The IFC structure, first developed in the 1990's, should be modernized so 

that a more complete suite of benefits from interoperability reaches critical mass and market 

adoption. With IFC modernization, a far more open, comprehensive and intelligent life-cycle 

data model for buildings can be achieved. 

IFC modernization working in parallel with highly efficient network-based communication, 

process management, decision support, and performance simulation of design alternatives is the 

sweet spot for achieving benefit in real property industry projects. IFC modernization will also 

tend to reduce the costs and inefficiencies that now result when builders and owners attempt to 

maintain consistent and unambiguous use of original project information by all project 

participants and stakeholders. 

Annex A provides additional explanation about what can be done by bSa and other AEC-related 

standards bodies to address the means to introduce messaging and web services for 

interoperability.  This annex explains and defines the mutual and supporting roles for the IT and 

AEC communities about how they may come together to work these challenges.   

6.5 Future Testbeds 

At the outset of the AECOO-1, bSa and OGC set out a number of goals for this effort.  They 

included the following: 

 Develop wide ranging and reusable technology solutions that support community business 
transformation; 

 Create a cost-effective and resource-efficient environment for industry to create standards 
and implement and adopt market driven solutions; 

 Foster a vibrant and knowledgeable AECOO community of practice that builds industry 
capacity to sustain transformation goals; 

 Induce software developers to meet broad user requirements with enhanced software 
capabilities; 

 Promote market driven targets of opportunity for academic research; and 

 Pilot a repeatable industry process that with success leads to continuous requirements 
definition and use of lessons learned. 

Industry stakeholders, driven by economic necessity and global competition, desire applications 

that can be knitted together and mate according to their individual practices and processes to 

provide client with their brand of architecture, construction and building products and services.  

Companies have also long sought to more effectively integrate information systems across their 

organization to better support business processes that cover all present and prospective 

requirements needed to run the business end-to-end.   

No one vendor has the best software for everything needed to author and/or evaluate a building‘s 

design, its cost, possible energy consumption, thermal comfort, lighting, acoustics, etc.  The 

industry requires the ability to seamlessly exchange and share building information among these 

sets of information technology tools.  These facts are what drove this testbed.  A generalized 

illustration of these problems is illustrated in Figure 8 below. 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary

Figure 8 – The Corporate Example for Authoring, Analysis and Information Exchange Across the 

Building Life Cycle 

Given the broad and well accepted, but inefficient, ways that buildings and other capital facilities 

are defined and constructed, the Sponsors have identified a few concerns about how virtual 

building models need to perform with cost estimating and energy information analysis practices 

during the iterative definition of space, design intent and construction quantities and their 

characteristics. 

Let‘s presume for the moment that the NBIMS project is operational, and there exist operating 

committees, working groups, that there are procedures for taking inputs and requirements in to 

that body for defining candidate standards, and there is in place a voting mechanism for 

consensus adoption.  Where should Testbeds (as defined by this Report) be used?  Where in the 

overall process can their use be most helpful (by that we mean addressing requirements in the 

form of IDM‘s and MVD‘s that are shown to work and seamlessly exchange information across 

vendor products)?  

Lesson: From our experiences in AECOO-1 we witnessed that many private businesses and 

public sector organizations have similar, if not the same requirements.  This lesson should be 

accounted for going forward in future work of NBIMS. 

Lesson: a more clear delineation will need to be made about the role and place of bSa 

fostering “ad hoc projects and aquariums” and formal Testbeds (that we presume will happen 

within in the NBIMS project).  We found bSa members confused by the purposes for each.  

Each does have a distinct purpose and each can and usually does involve the expense of 

resources (both cash and in-kind), however, the important difference for members to consider 

is about the payoffs, as well as the longer-term status of standards development using accepted 

consensus approaches and adoption throughout the market. 

Formal Testbeds are the best known way to address both national and international requirements 

where outcomes could result in the formal adoption of standards.  Only through standards, can 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  32 

the organizations across the AEC market reasonably address broader issues of risk.  The Testbed 

processes summarized here demonstrate that organizations can come together and work common 

areas of interest, and by pooling their resources, achieve expected results with less individual 

outlay, while providing a more rapid timeframe for success than with other means. 

Recommendation: In considering the use of Testbeds and other rapid prototyping standards 

development procedures that bridge gaps in communication across the AEC market, it is an 

imperative that bSa and associated standards bodies create an underlying framework for their 

work. This underlying framework (or architecture) needs to be tailored to identifying gaps in 

communication between AEC information systems and define what processes and tools in the 

standards bodies inventory can be applied in particular instances. Generally, in the case of 

IDM’s, AECOO-1 provides a template for future development of these kinds of documents that 

enables those specifications to be brought into the IT arenas for software development.  

However, Testbeds and other rapid prototyping activities are thought not the right venue for 

their development per se. IDM’s comprise the information requirements that are the 

specification that define what Testbeds ought to undertake with subject matter experts and IT 

specialists working together to formulate an exactified representation of those specifications in 

software. MVD’s that are shown to work in running code of provider’s software are the most 

efficient outcome of Testbeds.  Both IDM’s and their companion MVD’s should have an 

architectural framework that covers both syntactics and semantics so that interoperability is 

realized. (The reader is directed to Annex A for additional information and detail about this 

recommendation.)

Annex A: A Theory for Bridging Communication Gaps 
Among AEC Stakeholders 

Open software and data standards are the interlocking parts that enable interoperability 

standards. For standards to be risk reducers, efficient and adoptable there needs to be an 

architecture on which the standards rest. This framework is developed using reference models 

developed by non-exclusive industry consortia and task forces (like the OGC, Organization for 

the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), the World Wide Web 

Consortium (W3C), the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), the Internet Engineering Task Force 

(IETF) and others).  These organizations' frameworks guide developers and integrators in 

designing community-based and customer-specific open standard architectures for systems 

implementation, based on community open data models, information exchange standards, open 

interfaces, protocols, etc. that are intended to meet the needs of business enterprises, their user 

needs, business models and workflows.  The same must be in place for the AEC industry. 

One of the characteristics present in the AEC market today is the lack of a clear separation 

concerns between AEC business practices and domains and the means by which information 

technology is supplied. The concept of separation is necessary so that systems and applications 

meet their intended expectations.  Separation of concerns comes from exact philosophy, 

mathematics, programming and systems thinking that is the culmination of a shared exercise 

between stakeholders in the AEC market and IT experts.  These shared exercises are described 

using reference models to document the architectures that bind international information 

standards, domain information standards, and agreed to means for communication and 

messaging.  

It is time to apply disciplined approaches to BIM standard making.  As we consider more 

explicitly the build out and structural aspects for BIM standards in more disciplined manners, 

requires all stakeholders to exactifiy concepts and approaches that elicit understanding and 

specify the semantics of what are non-trivial facility design, construction and management 

practices and their respective IT system requirements. Creating these joint concepts across the 

industry is the basis for successful communication between business professionals in the AEC 

market and IT experts that build interoperable systems AEC professional want.   

Throughout the Summary Report we have used the term interoperability and have defined that 

term in its broadest sense. Now we must place adjectives in front of that term so that we can 

define more explicitly the kinds of disciplined work that lies ahead for both community 

stakeholders and the IT providers that deliver systems and applications. 

Let start with ―Syntactic Interoperability‖, which is all about parsing data correctly, and 

―Semantic Interoperability‖ which is all about the action of mapping terms and content analysis.  

These two expressions have important ramifications for NBIMS standards  -- syntactics is what 

the MVD is about, and semantics is what the IDM is about. 

Semantic interoperability requires formal and explicit specifications of domain information 

models, and agreed to definitions of the terms used, their relationships and expected behaviors of 

that information. (Note another word for these kinds of models and which is often used in the 

work to define IFD is ontology.)

These expressions may be used not only for dealing with computer-based information 

systems but also — and perhaps more importantly — for dealing with human stakeholders 

communicating with other humans with computer-based systems. 

The AECOO-1 Testbed has shown that communication gaps exist between AEC industry 

practice stakeholders and IT experts.  So, bSa‘s role and purpose in developing NBIMS can be 

exactified to correct instances where there is an absence of interoperability.  

Firstly, without syntactic interoperability AEC business stakeholders are with their choice of 

applications unable to parse data, so providers often resort to their own independent means to 

provide that capability without the community‘s agreement.  Of course, business experts cannot 

(and should not!) read code, but they also often cannot read specifications written by IT experts 

using notations (or terminology) that are overly complicated or alien to business terminologies. 

As we repeated often in the Summary Report, we need to understand the domain before 

addressing software. Business models are the basis of an organization‘s entire activity. They are 

to be understood by CEO and CFO, not just by CIO and explained without ‗method calls to 

XML representations‘. 

Using the same natural (colloquial) language as a notation is not sufficient since in order to 

preserve meaning we need also to preserve the same context, the same language experience, 

language norms, cultural tradition, and so on, and often these properties of different people 

acting in the AEC market are often implicit and different at the same time. For the information 

technologist, also at the same time, there needs to be a restrictive artificial language with 

precisely defined semantics that does not have context, cultural traditions, and so on, but still 

guarantee an adequate transmission of a message‘s semantics, provided, of course, that it can be 

adequately represented in that language.  This is both the conundrum and opportunity for the 

AEC industry to apply a level of discipline to its information handling approaches. 

An AEC Industry Architecture makes it possible (although not trivial!) to formulate 

understandable specifications in a disciplined manner. Specifications will be read by people who 

are non-experts in technology specification and especially applies to business specifications that 

are all too often reduced to ―business rules‖ encased in software code. 

Discipline means precision and abstraction. Precision means (among other things) that a 

developer will not have to invent business rules that have not been described and agreed to, or 

have been described in ambiguous or incomplete ways. Abstraction means (among other things) 

that the subject matter expert (e.g., architect, structural engineer, etc.) will not waste time and 

effort trying to understand business rules in terms of a particular computer-based 

implementation. Business rules (and a business enterprise in general) should be specified using 

abstract and precise concepts understandable to any subject matter expert, analyst, developer, 

or non-IT manager. 

An AEC Industry Architecture uses these concepts for all kinds of specifications — thus 

providing an excellent foundation for interoperability — and has been formalized by ANSI, 

IEEE, OASIS and ISO. This concept, if applied can describe the traditional businesses within 

AEC, as well as describe the essentials of any existing or to-be-created information system 

where interoperability is a requirement. In this manner, the business and IT stakeholders are able 

to use a common system of concepts and therefore to communicate in a meaningful manner. Of 

course, the syntactic representations used by different stakeholders to represent the same 

semantics may and often does differ, and also of course, different stakeholders may be interested

bSa Document:

in different levels and viewpoints when describing the same system, but the underlying semantic 

framework still remains the same. 

While using this concept for all kinds of specifications, we should explicitly separate business 

from IT system specifications because traditional business and IT ontologies are different. (As a 

well-known example, a patient is not the same as the patient‘s records.) The Architecture offers 

us the means to separate concerns. (For example, when we see that a specification becomes too 

complex for human understanding and is in danger of having ―too much stuff‖. ―Precise‖ is not 

the same as ―detailed‖, and therefore being abstract does not mean being imprecise. Good 

specifiers, in the same manner as good engineers, postpone decisions so as to not get drowned in 

details. The higher the level of abstraction the more important it is to be precise). 

Precision (exactification) is not sufficient for human understanding. Indeed, hundreds or 

thousands of pages of precise material are useless if the material is not well-structured. In other 

words, understanding requires abstraction — ―suppression of irrelevant detail‖, so that essential 

aspects of a specification are clearly separated from accidental ones. Clearly, this is not a new 

approach, but it has not been stressed in most work undertaken in the AEC market, and it is 

instructive that the concepts of abstraction, levels and viewpoints are among the first issues 

described in the application of reference models to industry architecture . 

Industry architectures use abstraction within the context of levels. Industry architecture also uses 

abstraction within the context of viewpoints — form[s] of abstraction achieved using a selected 

set of architectural concepts and structuring and sub-setting rules, in order to permit stakeholders 

the room to focus on particular concerns within a system. 

All viewpoints in any of the Reference Models are based on the same basic concepts of 

viewpoints — enterprise, information, computational, engineering, and technology. It is possible 

to define correspondences between viewpoints and Reference Models show how this is 

accomplished, but often, one viewpoint cannot be defined in terms of another. Of course, the five 

basic viewpoints are not the only ones that may be used to describe a system. In accordance with 

the definition of a viewpoint, any reasonable set of architectural concepts and structuring rules 

may be chosen to focus our attention on particular concerns within a system; and therefore we 

might simplify the work by defining business viewpoint and information system viewpoint which 

are analogous to IDMs and MVD‘s, but at higher levels of abstraction. In this manner, for 

example, we can exactify the slogan ―no requirements in terms of solutions‖ since requirements 

and solutions belong to different viewpoints. 

Creating and elucidating an AEC Industry Architecture domain model cannot be automated. 

There is no algorithm (or tool) to do that. The architecture is created and elucidated by teams 

consisting of domain subject matter experts and analysts who would work in NBIMS 

committees. Even when the subject matter experts are experienced in formulating semantics and 

ontologies of their domain in an abstract (that is, understandable) and precise manner, analysts 

are still essential to discover, elucidate and exactify tacit assumptions common to all, or some, 

subject matter experts.  (We found this particularly evident in our work on Quantity Take-off).  

Ignorance — real or perceived — of the subject matter cannot be present if a specification 

includes tacit assumptions that need or should become explicit. As early as the 1960‘s (in 

computing technology history) IT experts would comment ―Get some intelligent ignoramus to 

read through your documentation; [...] he will find many ‗holes‘ where essential information has 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:  

  36 

been omitted. Unfortunately intelligent people don‘t stay ignorant too long, so ignorance 

becomes a rather precious resource.‖ 

It is not sufficient to discover, formulate and use reference model concepts and structures 

essential for a good architecture. The intent is to start communicating these discoveries, both for 

communicating an understanding of the architecture and for its usage, but to let evolve. If we 

begin the architecture work using a concise and elegant suite of basic concepts then this provides 

the foundation for the standards that follow. 

In this context, it is instructive to reinforce the thought that ―requirements always change, and 

therefore it is useless to formulate them‖. Indeed, business processes often change. Such changes 

may lead to a competitive advantage for a segment of the industry or they may even be perceived 

as necessary for the industry to survive. Similarly, decisions about using IT systems to automate 

business processes may also change. At the same time, the basics of a business — its ontology 

— have usually remained the same for centuries. The changes due to modernity are minimal and 

are mostly additions to or refinements of the existing classical semantics and their use. 

These considerations apply to any kind of business architecture initiative as well as to 

requirements about information discovery and specification, independently of whether a 

computer-based IT system will be created, or bought to automate some business processes or 

workflow steps. As noted earlier, a crisp business architecture is used to make demonstrably 

effective business decisions only some of which are IT-related. Nonetheless, when viewed 

holistically the concepts, constructs and ultimate standards created based on that architecture 

define the art and science of effective reasoning.  

From over 50 years of systems development experience It is now well understood that attempts 

to comply with a specification that has incomplete or unclear semantics will not guarantee 

interoperability because important information will be lost. Use of reference models and their 

concepts makes it possible to completely and precisely define the essential aspects of the 

universe of discourse, be it to describe a business or an information management system.  

Using the approach suggested for NBIMS standards using the semantics of the appropriate 

domain rather than on existing products or solutions, standards can be devised based on an 

architecture that itself is defined in a clear and crisp manner. If so, then the specifications can be 

read, understood, and thus agreed or disagreed upon by all stakeholders confidently. Moreover, 

specifications of existing products or systems, including legacy systems, can be introduced back 

into architecture and lead to demonstrably justified user decisions about acquiring such systems.

Annex B: AIA Statement on Interoperability (Proposed) 

NEW POSITION STATEMENT REQUEST ON INTEROPERABILITY (Related to 

Project Delivery) 

Request for new Position Statement Submitted by the Board Integrated Practice Discussion 

Group 2009 (IPDiG) 

Interoperability Position Statement 

The American Institute of Architects believes that all industry-supporting software must 

facilitate, not inhibit project planning, design, construction, and commissioning and lifecycle 

management. This software must support non-proprietary; open standards for auditable 

information exchange (such as the building SMART International Industry Foundation Classes 

(IFC); open XML schemas; CIS/2; and other widely accepted open standards that may emerge 

over time) and allow for confident data exchanges across applications and across time. 

This is best accomplished through professional, public- and private- sector adoption of open 

standards. The American Institute of Architects recognizes that it and its members have a 

significant role in the ongoing development of open standards. 

Interoperability Position Statement Explanation 

Why Interoperability? 

Not all architects (or consultants, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers or owners) use the same 

software packages for their work, nor should they: each should use the best tool for the job in 

their particular business enterprise. But industry stakeholders do not work in a vacuum: they 

must share information in order to complete projects, and the amount of necessary information 

sharing is increasing at a dramatic pace. Transforming business processes require data 

interoperability. Data interoperability demands clear definition of necessary business information 

exchanges. Not every exchange must contain all data; however, business information exchanges 

required to facilitate the project should contain the information appropriate and necessary to 

perform the function of the exchange or task at hand. 

There are many dimensions to the data or information contained in software packages used in the 

AEC industry today. Begin by considering a building information model: every single object in a 

model has dozens or hundreds of discrete pieces of associated alphanumeric or geometric data. 

Multiply that by the hundreds or thousands of objects in the model. Then layer on possible other 

uses of the data beyond the model, like performance analysis of the design (structural, thermal, 

lighting, etc.), project management, estimating or facility management software, or sharing of the 

data between different BIM applications, and so on. Acknowledge that some of the data is time-

sensitive and may change over the life of the model. The complexity of ensuring those hundreds 

of thousands of pieces of data be shared between packages in an accurate, consistent, complete 

and effective fashion, especially when one acknowledges the proprietary nature of the software 

packages, is mind-boggling. It‘s also hugely wasteful and ineffective: a 2004 study by the 

National Institute of Standards and Technology suggests that $15.8 billion is lost annually in the 

AEC industry due to the lack of accurate and effective information exchange. The 2007 McGraw 

Hill SmartMarket Report on Interoperability states that on average, 3.1% of the cost of every 

project is waste due to lack of interoperability. The AIA must assume a leadership role in 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary 

bSa Document:

seeking a solution to this problem and should work with other organizations to reach effective 

and positive outcomes. 

Why open standards? 

Effective information exchange requirements in other technologically intensive fields such as 

emergency response, GIS, finance and healthcare are demonstrating the fundamental value of 

open standards based information exchange. The AEC industry is not an exception and may 

anticipate benefits similar to those experienced in other fields. Consider:  

Every AEC software package is based on a particular, unique data schema (data organization 

framework—how content is organized). This data schema is typically proprietary and hidden. 

To accurately exchange information between any two software packages, one of the following 

must be true: 

1) Package B must be based on the same schema as package A; or 

2) Package B must be able to directly import (map) data into its schema from the schema of 

package A; or 

3) Package A must be able to export (map) data from its schema into a transfer format or neutral 

exchange schema, from which package B must be able to import (map) the same data into its 

schema. 

Condition 1 is uncommon; schemas are typically unique to every software package, and are 

protected as proprietary information. Condition 2 involves close collaboration of the developers 

of the two software packages but limits an exchange to just those implemented. Condition 3 is 

potentially the most robust, but requires that the two developers agree to the specifics of the 

neutral exchange schema. 

If the example is expanded to include not just two packages but the larger world of software 

packages used by all project participants, and the complexity of the hundreds of thousands of 

pieces of necessary data exchange outlined above is layered on top, it becomes clear that two 

developers agreeing on a neutral exchange schema is insufficient and that the AEC industry as a 

whole needs to agree on and support a neutral transfer schema. This is most practical through 

industry-wide adoption of an open data-sharing standard (exchange schema), visible and 

transparent to all, supporting business workflows defined as much as possible by users. 

Why should AIA members care? 

Overall productivity loss and fragmentation in the capital facilities development industries is no 

longer tolerable. Architects need to practice the best way they know, and practice profitably; 

software interoperability problems must not hold them back. Potential of loss of competition in 

the software market is not acceptable. 

Without software interoperability: 

 Expense to the AEC and Owner in training and re-training in multiple platforms will 
increase; 

 Waste in time, materials, energy and money will increase; 

 AEC and Owner productivity will continue its decline as data re-entry, document versioning 
and checking, and other workflow problems increase; 



OGC Document: OGC 10-003r1  AECOO-1 Summary

 The capital facility industry may segment again, this time around software solutions; 

 Collaborative delivery models such as Integrated Project Delivery will not deliver the 
benefits the profession anticipates; 

 Architects may not be able to access files in the future without fear of loss of data or loss of 
whole file; 

 Lack of competition may yield fewer affordable software solutions necessary to support 
architects‘ business practices; 

 Architects may lose future commissions and necessary collaboration partners; 

 The software industry will not achieve the robust development of the analysis and simulation 
tools and interfaces necessary to serve the rapidly changing industry; 

 New software concepts, tools and opportunities may be marginalized if dominant software 
companies release interoperability features following their own agendas. 

A large, competitive, interoperable software market is needed for innovation to flourish.
