Abstract 

This White Paper supports development of a Smart Cities Spatial Information Framework 
based on these themes: 

 Smart Cities are high-density generators of innovation and information. 
 Location information is a major enabler of Smart City technology benefits. 
 Benefits of smart technology must be judged by benefits to residents. 
 Reuse and repurpose is vital to urban resilience 
 Open standards are needed for interoperability, efficiency, application innovation 

and cost effectiveness. 
 
Discussion of these themes and this white paper will occur at the OGC Smart Cities 
Location Powers Summit in Tokyo on December 2, 2014,1 the co-located OGC Technical 
Committee meeting, and in many other forums in the future. As described in this paper, 
there are many standards initiatives that focus on Smart Cities. Most Smart Cities use 
cases in some way involve indoor and/or outdoor location, and thus communication about 
location is an issue that cuts across the work programs most of the standards 
organizations that are involved with Smart Cities. 

This white paper builds on the OGC - Directions Magazine webinar: “Making Location 
Work for Smart Cities – the Case for Location Standards”2.

1. A Spatial Information Framework for Smart Cities?  

Today, urban population accounts for 54 percent of the total global population (World 
Health Organization 2014) with a trend to more urbanization.  Effective integration of 
human, physical, and digital systems operating in the built environment holds the promise 
of improving the quality of life of urban residents, improving the governance of cities and 
making cities prosperous, inclusive, sustainable and resilient.  Location is a primary 
method for organizing Smart City services.  Communicating anything about location 
requires standards. This paper addresses the open information technology standards 
framework that is critical to achieving the benefits of spatial communication for Smart 
Cities.  

 

Figure 1.  A Smart City uses location as an organizing principal to benefit residents, visitors, and 
businesses of all types. (Graphic from Steve Liang, University of Calgary) 

This White Paper provides a draft spatial information framework for Smart Cities.  The 
document is structured using an architectural approach for defining information systems 
organized as a set of viewpoints.  The set of viewpoints used here are based on ISO/IEC 
10746, Information Technology — Open Distributed Processing — Reference Model.   

 Section 2 of the report provides an Enterprise Viewpoint, including a definition of 
a Smart City, the Indicators for assessing the value of deploying the technology, 
and an overall set of components for the information system of a Smart City. 

 Section 3 provides an Information Viewpoint, outlining the spatial information 
and data that is needed in a Smart City. 

 Section 4 outlines the computational Services Viewpoint including interfaces and 
workflows pertinent to a achieve interoperability using a service oriented 
architecture for a Smart City. 

 Section 5 provides a Deployment Viewpoint, identifying approaches for 
deploying the Spatial Information Framework in cities. 

An Annex provides a summary of standardization activities regarding Smart Cities.  The 
architecture in the main body of the white paper aims to build on and contribute back to 
the activities of those SDOs.

2. Smart City Information Enterprise 

2.1 What’s so smart about Smart Cities? 

A Smart City provides effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in the 
built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its 
citizens3. 

While the focus in this white paper is on technology, implementing smart cities must 
consider social policy and the benefits of technology to humans. Much of the Smart City 
technology has focused on command and control approaches for emergency response and 
resource management. Command and control is a requirement but the smart city 
technology and standards must also enable and enhance citizen access to the smart city 
resources. This emphasis recalls Jane Jacobs’s revolution in urban planning4 some 
decades ago, which focused on the value of community life and social networks.  

In The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs said, “Cities have the 
capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are 
created by everybody.” Physical city architect Jan Gehl recalls that “fifty years ago 
Jacobs said – go out there and see what works and what doesn’t work, and learn from 
reality. Look out of your windows, spend time in the streets and squares and see how 
people actually use spaces, learn from that, and use it.5”  Applied to smart city 
information development Jacob’s ideas point to “Open Information ” and “Iterative 
Development. 

 Architects of Smart City information systems need to think of "openness" as a key 
technology design principle that helps developers and users of technology see 
what works and what doesn't work. 

 Low-cost, open-participation iterative experiments, testbeds and pilot projects 
based on free and open interface and encoding standards encourage innovation 
and provide insight and guidance that can optimize for improvisation and 
resilience as well as prevent expensive IT failures. 

To be successful, a Smart City must enable better choices by its citizens, organizations 
and governments.

2.2 Indicators for city services and quality of life 

2.2.1 Indicators for Sustainable development and resilience of communities  
Cities need metrics to measure their performance.  The ISO international standards 
organization is developing a series of standards to support sustainable development and 
resilience in cities.  A key standard is ISO/DIS 37120 Sustainable development and 
resilience of communities — Indicators for city services and quality of life 

ISO 37120 defines methodologies for a set of indicators to steer and measure the 
performance of city services and quality of life.  The indicators in ISO 37120 are 
organized in themes: 

 Economy 
 Education 
 Energy 
 Environment 
 Recreation 
 Safety 
 Shelter 
 Solid waste 
 Telecommunications and innovation 
 Finance 
 Fire and emergency response 
 Governance 
 Health 
 Transportation 
 Urban planning 
 Wastewater 
 Water and sanitation 

Developing and communicating data needed for most of these ISO 37120 indicators 
involves geospatial technologies and in many cases geolocated sensors. A few examples 
are provided in the next sections.  Spatial information technologies identified in this 
framework will be supportive of these indicators, not just to calculate and communicate 
measures for these indicators but to enable planning, development and public leadership 
in achieving the indicators.  

2.2.2 Recreation indicator: Outdoor recreation space 
“Square meters of public outdoor recreation space per capita” is indicator 13.2 in the 
Recreation category of ISO 37120.  ISO 37120 advises:  The information for this 
indicator can be obtained from a City Planning Department together with departments 
knowledgeable about the city. Outdoor recreation spaces may also be delineated using 
aerial photography and/or land use maps. Once the areas have been identified on a map, 
the area in square meters may be calculated using low cost Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) or, if not available, through use of hand-held measuring devices. Area 
may be calculated in hectares or acres and converted to square meters. 



 

 8  Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The value of outdoor recreation space has recently been highlight by work led by the 
architect Jan Gehl in Copenhagen6 and New York City.7   

Spatial "flows" are important in understanding recreation space. Who goes to a 
recreational space by what routes to do what in that space, and how can recreational 
space be optimized to maximize citizen benefits? What are the flows of energy, water and 
wastes associated with the space? How do these flows connect with flows in adjacent 
non-recreational spaces? Answering such questions requires collection and 
communication of diverse types of 2D, sometimes 3D, and often 4D spatial data. 

2.2.3 Energy indicator: Renewable energy sources 
“The percentage of total energy derived from renewable sources, as a share of the city's 
total energy consumption” is indicator 7.4 in the Energy category of ISO 37120. 

ISO 37120 advises that data sources for this indicator are from local utility provider, city 
energy or environment office, and from various international sources, such as the 
International Energy Agency (IEA), and the World Bank.  

"Total energy" consumed by municipal buildings and services are more quantifiable and 
manageable for renewable supply than total energy used throughout a city. Smart Cities 
will develop many ways to calculate energy needs and renewable resources at a 
"hyperlocal" scale. 

The Solar Atlas of Berlin8 identifies that approximately 220,000 rooftops in Berlin are 
suitable for the operation of photovoltaic systems – and many owners are unaware of the 
potential. They could deliver roughly 3 million megawatts of electricity per year if solar 
modules were installed on all theoretically suitable roofs.  

Integrated Community Energy Systems (ICES)9 assess and match up energy needs and 
sources at an urban district and community level and provide means for negotiating local 
owner-to-owner and owner-to-user transactions. Advances in energy storage, "cooling 
storage", co-generation of heat and electric power, and open standards for developing and 
sharing information about buildings, pipes and wires, and indoor spaces all contribute to 
the growing value and utilization of ICES. 

2.2.4 Environment indicator: Noise pollution  
“Noise Pollution” is indicator 8.7 in the Environment category of ISO/DIS 37120. 

ISO 37120 states that noise pollution shall be calculated by mapping the noise level Lden 
(day-evening-night) likely to cause annoyance as given in ISO 1996-2:1987, identifying

the areas of the city where Lden is greater than 55 dB(A) and estimating the population of 
those areas as a percentage of the total city population. The result shall be expressed as 
the percentage of the population affected by noise pollution. 

3D visualization of noise mapping based on regulations in Europe have been achieved 
using the INSPIRE Building Model based on the OGC CityGML standard.10 

Noise pollution is only one of many factors that can be used to describe a neighborhood. 
There is no open, consensus-derived international standard encoding for describing 
neighborhoods. What other characteristics besides noise level should such a standard 
describe? There is no open international standard encoding for communicating the 
characteristics of buildings in a neighborhood (though the INSPIRE Data Specification 
on Buildings described in Section 3.2 provides a model). What would be the costs and 
value of creating such standards and ensuring that they work together along with other 
open spatial standards so that information about neighborhoods and buildings could be 
easily shared and used in analyses of many kinds? 

2.3 Smart City Applications  

Smart City technologies enable a broad set of applications including: 
 Utilities - Smart Grid, Smart Water, etc. 
 Sanitation 
 Intelligent Buildings 
 Intelligent Transportation 
 Health 
 Public Safety and Security 
 Environmental Protection 
 Emergency Services 
 Education 
 Urban Planning 
 Open Data 

Each of the SDOs listed in Annex A has a variation of this list of Smart City 
Applications.  Also commercial companies, including OGC member companies, have 
multi-faceted strategies for Smart Cities.  For example, OGC members are developing 
smart city strategies11 as well as Smart City application stores.12

2.4 Smart City Enterprise framework 

Smart Cities require deployment of interoperable information system components.  The 
high-level enterprise view of Smart City Components is shown in Figure 2.  The 
components are organized in layers typical of an information system deployment.  

 

Figure 2. Enterprise Components 

The Layers in this enterprise component diagram are based on the approach defined by 
the ITU Focus Group on Smart Sustainable Cities (See Section A.1.1).  The layers are 
also consistent with the approach used in China’s Smart City Pilots13.  

Subsequent sections 3 Information Viewpoint and 4 Services Viewpoint, define details 
for implementing the enterprise components.

3. Spatial Information and Smart Cities 

3.1 Spatial information is pervasive and primary 

When organized using the concepts of space and time, information about cities can be the 
basis for many powerful services, analytics and decision-making.  This section provides 
the beginnings of an architecture for urban spatial "intelligence" based on open standards, 
such as CityGML.

The urban environment must address multiple scales of spatial information.

building information models are the basis for accurate and comprehensive spatial modeling for 
Smart Cities.

Figure 5 depicts some of the data model standards or encoding standards that make up the 
open information technology standards framework.  Members of the OGC are actively 
involved in developing best practices for integrating these approaches. Such best 
practices will become part of the Smart Cities Spatial Information Framework.

standards for use by Smart City information system architects   (Source Carsten Rönsdorf) 

 

3.2 CityGML and IndoorGML 

Smart cities require a framework of trusted/authoritative data; for example, core reference 
data in 2D and 3D (i.e. topography), identifiers and addressing, smart infrastructure 
(BIM, smart grid), and sensor feeds. Also critical is a Smart City's openness to data types, 
such as volunteered, unstructured14 and linked data15. Such a framework needs a robust 
data integration platform, which is provided, in part, by OGC City Geography Markup 
Language (CityGML). 

With CityGML, spatial data become an “operating system” for a virtual version of a city. 
Practical use cases include things such as optimization of transport and efficient energy 
use. Berlin's city model enables a variety of improved city services including economic 
development/investment, real estate, city marketing and event management. For decades, 
cities have used GIS and geospatial data to improve various services and operations. A 
good example is London’s use of geospatial data for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
Games to establish the route network and determine traffic impacts. Authorities in 
London also used geographic data to manage security operations and help direct building 
of needed infrastructure.

Smart cities require standards that enable data and apps to easily interoperate, but this 
requirement is often overlooked. A good way to begin is to develop a citywide 2D and 
3D urban data model to integrate different sources of available geospatial data. The data 
model becomes the city's open standard, a language that all actors, datasets and 
technologies use to interact.  

 
Figure 6. CityGML as an integration platform (Source: Carsten Rönsdorf) 

 
CityGML has been implemented in many cities including Berlin and Abu Dhabi, and it 
has been implemented countrywide in the Netherlands, Bahrain and Germany. CityGML 
enables semantic modeling, that is, each element in the model includes data about that 
element's meaning, structure and relationships.  

 The Berlin 3D City Model16 represents one of the world's largest municipal city 
models.  It contains 560,000 fully textured building models in Level of Detail 2 
(LoD2) and more than 200 detailed models in LoD3/4.  The city model is the 
basis of the Berlin Economic Atlas and the Solar Atlas referenced earlier. 

 INSPIRE Data Specification on Buildings17 specifies a harmonized data 
specification for the spatial data theme Buildings as defined in Annex III of the 
INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The 3D representations of buildings 
are generally described using the well-defined levels of detail of the CityGML 
OGC standard.  This INSPIRE specification is the basis of the visualization of 
noise mapping described earlier.

 The national 3D standard in The Netherlands has been established using 
CityGML as described in OGC Best Practice: CityGML ADE - Dutch 3D 
standard (OGC document 12-066)18

The OGC IndoorGML Encoding Standard specifies an open abstract data model and 
XML schema for indoor spatial information, specifically for modeling indoor spaces for 
navigation purposes.  IndoorGML is designed to work with CityGML. 

IndoorGML provides an open standard that supports easy discovery, assessment, access 
and use of data for applications that enable, for example, indoor location-based services, 
indoor route analysis, indoor geo-tagging services, and emergency control in indoor 
space. Requirements for other types of applications including indoor facility management 
may be addressed in the next version of IndoorGML.  

IndoorGML provides a framework to represent contained spaces (such as rooms and 
corridors) as cells. Connections between spaces and constraints on movement between 
spaces (such as doors) are represented as relationships between cells. This OGC Standard 
defines the following information about indoor space: 

 Navigation context and constraints 
 Space subdivisions and types of connectivity between spaces 
 Geometric and semantic properties of spaces and connectivity 
 Navigation networks (logical and metric) and their relationships

3.3 LandXML and InfraGML25 

LandXML is a non-proprietary XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) data file format 
containing civil engineering and survey measurement data commonly used in the Land 
Development and Transportation Industries.  The LandXML user community consists of over 
650 organizations with 750 members in over 40 countries and the standard is supported by 
over 70 registered software products. 
 
The OGC Land and Infrastructure Domain Working Group is developing a new candidate 
standard – the OGC InfraGML Encoding Standard. This candidate standard provides a use 
case driven subset of LandXML26 functionality, but that is implemented with the OGC 
Geography Markup Language (GML) and supported by a UML (Unified Modeling 
Language) conceptual model. InfraGML. The LandInfraDWG was chartered in 2013 to 
“focus is being designed to make it easy to use CAD-based land information with other OGC 
standards.” Both the land and infrastructure user domain and the geospatial technology user 
domain would benefit from integrated access to the two types of information. 
 
One of the initial goals of the LandInfraDWG was to gain a better understanding of exactly 
what LandXML is and does.  LandXML-1.2 contains almost 5000 lines of minimally 
documented XML code covering some 16 subject areas.  There is no formally published 
documentation, user guide, requirements definition, or underlying conceptual model. 
 
The Land and Infrastructure Standards Working Group (LandInfraSWG) was therefore 
chartered.  Its first task was to develop a UML as-is conceptual model of LandXML-1.2 to: 

 Aid in the understanding of what LandXML 1.2 is and does 
 Provide the basis for a conceptual model of what a future Land standard should do, 

based on an assessment of user requirements 
 Establish a single set of consistent concepts that could be implemented in any set of 

potential implementation-specific standards, such as a LandXML 2.0, a LandGML, a 
LandSQL, etc. 

This reverse engineering of a LandXML conceptual model revealed a number of problems 
with LandXML as well as broad disparity with the OGC standards baseline. These findings 
are summarized in the working groups’ November 5, 2013 “InfraGML Proposal (OGC 
Document 13-121r1)” plan of action. 
 
Fixing LandXML and extending it to support new technologies would result in a non-
backwards compatible version.  Consequently, the LandInfraSWG decided to embark upon 
the development of the new InfraGML standard.  Initial subject areas will include 
alignments, road, survey, terrain, and land parcels.  Use cases have been documented for 
these subject areas.  A draft UML conceptual model is almost complete and is being readied 
for public comment by the end of 2014.  GML encoding is scheduled to begin early next 
year.

26 LandXML is a non-proprietary XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) data file format containing civil 
engineering and survey measurement data commonly used in the Land Development and Transportation 
Industries. LandXML data is of value to the larger geospatial data community, but currently the format is 
not integrated with any of the OGC’s or ISO’s geospatial standards.

3.4 Building Information Models 

OGC is working with other standards development organizations (SDOs) to converge 
Building Information Model (BIM), 3D and Geospatial standards27.  ISO/TC 59 
Buildings and civil engineering works28, buildingSMART29, and the OGC are 
coordinating for the development of standards as a foundation for the convergence of 
building and civil engineering design and geospatial technology.   Other relevant SDOs 
include the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization (MISMO)30, the 
National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS)31 and OSCRE International32.

4. Interoperability Services for Smart Cities 

4.1 Geospatial Services Architecture 

Access and processing of geospatial information for smart cities is achieved in a service-
oriented architecture using open standards as shown in Figure 8.  The OGC services are 
grouped in the figure and discussed in the following sections. 

 

Figure 8. OGC Services Architecture for interoperable access and processing of geospatial 
information for decision support. 

4.2 Sensor Web Enablement and SensorThings 

The OGC's Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards enable developers to make all 
types of sensors, transducers and sensor data repositories discoverable, accessible and 
useable via the Web33. 

The OGC SWE standards are: 
 Observations & Measurements (O&M) –The general models and XML encodings 

for observations and measurements. 
 Sensor Model Language (SensorML) – Standard models and XML Schema for 

describing the processes within sensor and observation processing systems. 
 Sensor Observation Service (SOS) – Open interface for a web service to obtain 

observations and sensor and platform descriptions from one or more sensors. 
                                                
33 http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sensorwebdwg  



 

 18  Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 Sensor Planning Service (SPS) – An open interface for a web service by which a 
client can 1) determine the feasibility of collecting data from one or more sensors 
or models and 2) submit collection requests. 

 PUCK Protocol Standard – Defines a protocol to retrieve a SensorML description, 
sensor "driver" code, and other information from the device itself, thus enabling 
automatic sensor installation, configuration and operation.  

 SWE Common Data Model – Defines low-level data models for exchanging 
sensor related data between nodes of the OGC® Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) 
framework. 

 SWE Service Model – Defines data types for common use across OGC Sensor 
Web Enablement (SWE) services. Five of these packages define operation request 
and response types. 

The OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) SensorThings API candidate standard, now in 
draft will be an important standard for IoT. It builds on the OGC's comprehensive SWE 
standards suite, but it is designed to be lightweight and easily implemented. It 
incorporates a REST-like API and JSON encoding, supports standards-based location 
encodings (indoor/outdoor, mobile/stationary), is linked data ready (JSON-LD), and is 
Pub-Sub ready (MQTT). 

4.3 Data Access Services 

The Access Services include the WFS and WCS Standards. 

The OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)34 standard, also published as ISO 19142, allows a 
client to retrieve and update geospatial data encoded in Geography Markup Language 
(GML) and other encoding formats. WFS define interfaces for data access and 
manipulation operations on geographic features. Via these interfaces, a user client can 
combine, use and manage geodata from different sources. Open standards for encoding 
feature data include GML, JSON, and KML.   

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS)35 standard supports electronic retrieval of 
geospatial data as "coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing 
space/time-varying phenomena. WCS provides access to coverage data in forms that are 
useful for client-side rendering, as input into scientific models, and for other clients.   
Open standards for encoding coverage data include NetCDF, HDF, GRIB, BUFR and 
GeoTIFF. 

4.4 Processing Services 

The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS)36 Interface Standard provides rules for 
standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial processing 
services, such as polygon overlay. The standard also defines how a client can request the 
                                                
34 http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs

execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an 
interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clients’ discovery of 
and binding to those processes. The data required by the WPS can be delivered across a 
network or they can be available at the server.  

The OGC Table Joining Service (TJS)37 offers a way to expose this corporate data to 
other computers, so that it can be found and accessed, and a way to merge that data with 
the spatial data that describes the framework, in order to enable mapping or geospatial 
analysis. 

4.5 Catalogue Services 

Catalogue services (also sometimes called registry services) provide interfaces to 
discover, browse, and query metadata about data, services, and other potential resources.   
The OGC Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) is a binding defined in the OpenGIS 
Catalogue Services Implementation Standard (CAT)38.  (An OGC OpenSearch Geo 
standard is nearing adoption as OGC standard and is applicable as well.)  

4.6 Workflow 

Several SDOs define workflow standards that have been used by OGC.  Often spatial 
processing will require several steps.  The combination of workflows services and the 
OGC WPS provide a robust architecture for geospatial information processing. 

The OGC Geoprocessing Workflow Architecture Engineering Report39 provides a 
summary of Geoprocessing Workflow practices and methods that have been implemented 
in a services architecture using OGC services. 

4.7 Context Document and GeoPackage  

An OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS Context)40 can be used to organize a 
set of spatial information about a given topic and location.  The Context document is 
share with user clients that open the OWS Context, retrieve the information, e.g., map 
layers and display the information. 

This OGC GeoPackage Standard41 defines SQLite Extensions for direct use of vector 
geospatial features and / or tile matrix sets of earth images and raster maps at various 
scales. GeoPackages are interoperable across all enterprise and personal computing 
environments, and are particularly useful on mobile devices like cell phones and tablets 
in communications environments with limited connectivity and bandwidth.  

Context and GeoPackage work well together to send geospatial info to mobile devices.

4.8 Visualization and Augmented Reality  

The OGC has adopted standards that support visualization of geographic information.  These 
standards allow applications to separate portrayal functions from processing functions in a 
single device or in distributed environments. For example: 

 The OGC Web Map Service (WMS) Interface Standard provides a simple HTTP 
interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed 
geospatial databases. The images are returned in specified format such as TIF or 
JPEG.  

 The OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) standard provides for serving spatially 
referenced tile images with predefined content, extent, and resolution. WMTS trades 
the flexibility of custom map rendering – as provided by WMS – for the scalability 
possible by serving a fixed set of tiles.  

 The OGC Symbology Encoding Standard is an XML language for styling 
information and related symbology rules.  OGC SLD allows Different cartographic 
styles to be applied to the same data, enabling delivery of different map styles for 
different user populations, such as assessors and first responders.  

 OGC KML is an XML language focused on geographic visualization, including 
annotation of maps and images. Geographic visualization includes not only the 
presentation of graphical data on the globe, but also the control of the user's 
navigation in the sense of where to go and where to look. 

 The OGC ARML 2.0 candidate standard provides an interchange format for 
Augmented Reality (AR) applications to describe and interact with objects in an AR 
scene, with a focus on mobile, vision-based AR. 

 
3D portrayal standards are being finalized by an OGC Standards Working Group42.  The 
group is to progress the Candidate Web 3D Service Interface Standard and the Web View 
Service Discussion Paper to the state of an integrated, adopted OGC standard. The SWG 
will achieve this objective by processing the comments submitted during the public 
comment period and ensuring that the candidate standard is consistent with the OGC 
baseline and business plan.   

The 3D Portrayal SWG builds on the success of the OGC 3D Portrayal Interoperability 
Experiment (3DPIE)43 The 3DPIE report contains technical details on processing 3D 
information in an OGC service environment as well as best practices on how to portray 
large data sets in urban planning scenarios, taking into account architectures and 
capabilities of interactive 3D graphics. Especially Web 3D Service and Web View 
Service, two draft standards (published as OGC discussions paper), have been in the 
focus of 3DPIE. 

A demonstration at Mobile World Congress 2014 of three major AR browsers showed 
the vision of interoperable AR.44

5. Development of Spatial Information Framework for Smart Cities 

5.1 Spatial Information Architecture for Smart Cities  

This white paper is one step in a process of applying open standards to the spatial 
information vital to Smart Cities.  This white paper will be considered by the OGC 
membership with discussion of next steps.  Possible next steps include for the OGC 
Standards Program 

 Discussion of Spatial Information Framework for Smart Cities with several OGC 
Working Groups including the Urban Planning DWG and the 3D Information 
Management DWG. 

 Development of an OGC Best Practice for Smart Cities.  This white paper serves 
as input to such a best practice. 

 Identification and development of profiles of OGC standards needed for Smart 
Cities.   

 Coordination with other SDOs about standards that work together to provide an 
operational set of standards for Smart Cities.  The SDOs identified in Annex A 
are candidates for such coordination. 

The Location Powers Smart City Summit was held on 2 December 2014 in Tokyo45. The 
Summit focused on understanding the location and place needs of a Smart City. 
Participants tested assumptions of what a Smart City is, explored the role of the citizen, 
looked at the fundamental infrastructure, and looked at how we “see” a Smart City and 
understand a Smart City. This white paper benefited from the discussion at the Summit. 

5.2 OGC Smart City Interoperability Initiatives – Testbeds, Pilots etc. 

The OGC Interoperability Program provides an agile, rapid engineering environment to 
accelerate development and testing of standards based on real world use cases. Candidate 
information exchange standards are developed at the same time that OGC vendor 
members are developing prototype software solutions. The OGC has conducted more 
than 80 of these international multi-firm R&D experiments in the last 15 years, each 
based on user-supplied scenarios. OGC testbeds have repeatedly demonstrated success at 
transitioning research into operations based on open standards.   

The OGC Interoperability Program is carrying out a strategy for Smart Cities.  Activities 
relevant to Smart Cities are currently underway in OGC Testbed 11 and the CityGML 
Quality Interoperability Experiment.  Pilots for specific cities are in the planning stages.  
The pilots will carryout the deployments described in the next section and additional 
activities.

5.3 Deploying the Spatial Information Framework for Smart Cities 

5.3.1 Building a City Model 
Building a model of the urban environment using OGC CityGML is a first step for many 
of the deployments described below.  Having a CityGML representation of a city is the 
modern day equivalent of having a 2D map.  Having a 3D, semantically enabled 
information model of the city enables many functions. 

Building a CityGML model has been done in many cities.  OGC is currently preparing a 
report – “Rapid model-building for venue owners” – on the steps and costs associated 
with building a CityGML model from multiple information sources. 

5.3.2 Common Operating Picture 
Accurate, timely, and georeferenced information is vital to operational and strategic 
decision-making. The incompatibility of proprietary databases and software used by the 
in previous emergencies has been a hindrance.  Based on lessons learned, government 
agencies are requiring the private sector to support open standards based approaches in 
particular for creating a Common Operating Picture (COP) for emergency response. 

Working with government and industry, OGC has led development of a COP 
Architecture for emergencies.  Figure 9 provides the recommended services architecture 
for a COP based on Web Services.  This COP architecture has been applied in multiple 
OGC initiatives for emergencies located in urban areas.  Figure 9 identifies services and 
interfaces based on best practices and open standards.  This architecture is based on 
operational and development systems that deliver a COP for oil spill response using open 
standards. Packaging the services into components is addressed in the Deployment 
Viewpoint section of this document.

5.3.3 Recreation indicator: Outdoor recreation space 
Calculation of area for urban spaces is a mature GIS-based capability.  Key to best use of 
urban space is to have a richer semantic understanding of these spaces.  Also it’s 
important that both indoor and outdoor spaces are counted in the semantic bucket of 
interest.  

“Square meters of public outdoor recreation space per capita” is indicator 13.2 in the 
Recreation category of ISO 37120.  Calculating this indicator and related space 
calculations is easy using a CityGML model.  Additional studies can be accomplished, 
e.g., some indoor spaces would provide the same benefits as outdoor public spaces.  
Calculation of the area can be done from any open-standards client requesting a query to 
WFS-equipped database holding the CityGML model and/or could be calculated by 
request to a WPS that performs the algorithm. 

Additionally studies of spatial "flows" are important in understanding recreation space. 
Two additional OGC standards are relevant to spatial flows.   

 The OGC IndoorGML standard is for navigation and routing of indoor spaces.  
Knowing the available spatial flows for indoor mobility in different modes is key 
to such a study.   

 The OGC Moving Features standard captures the movement of pedestrian and 
vehicles through spaces.  The advance of mobile computing and internet-
connected sensors (including sensors and GPS transponders in cell phones and 
notebook computers) brings with it a rapid rise in applications for moving feature 
data. 

Crowdsourcing of data about pedestrian and vehicle movement in urban environments is 
a great source for spatial flow studies to improve the quality and safety of urban living. 

5.3.4 Energy indicator: Renewable energy sources 
“The percentage of total energy derived from renewable sources, as a share of the city's 
total energy consumption” is indicator 7.4 in the Energy category of ISO 37120. 

The Solar Atlas of Berlin46 is based on the Berlin CityGML model is an operational 
system based on open standards so that the approach can be easily set up in any city 
based on a CityGML model.  

Open standards-based are the foundation for integrating BIM, geospatial and smart 
meters for urban energy performance optimization conducted by the European 
SUNSHINE project47

5.3.5 Environment indicator: Noise pollution  
“Noise Pollution” is indicator 8.7 in the Environment category of ISO/DIS 37120. 

This indicator can be assessed using established methods based on OGC standards.  3D 
visualization of noise mapping based on regulations in Europe have been achieved using 
the INSPIRE Building Model based on the OGC CityGML standard.48 

 
Figure 10. Web 3D visualization of noise mapping using OGC standards 

 

5.3.6 Urban Economic Analysis 
Urban economic modeling and effective spatial planning are critical tools towards 
achieving urban sustainability. However, in practice, many technical obstacles, such as 
information islands, poor documentation of data and lack of software platforms to 
facilitate virtual collaboration, are challenging the effectiveness of decision-making 
processes. Li et.al. reports49 on their efforts to design and develop a geospatial 
cyberinfrastructure (GCI) for urban economic analysis and simulation. The urban GCI 
implements several OGC standards: WMS, WFS as well as WPS. The WPS is used in a 
chained flow of geoprocessing services to support effective spatial policy analysis and 
decision-making.   

5.3.7 Analytics – Science of Cities 
Analytics refers to the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data, 
particularly "big data."  Big data refers to massive volumes of data that typically include 
both structured and unstructured data that are thus difficult to process using traditional 
database and software methods.  In Smart Cities, processing of sensor feeds using big 
data analytics will be useful for many purposes.

The new science of analytics is integral to a "New Science of Cities50," the title of a book 
by Michael Batty. As stated on the publisher's web page for the book:  

"In The New Science of Cities, Michael Batty suggests that to understand cities we 
must view them not simply as places in space but as systems of networks and flows. 
To understand space, he argues, we must understand flows, and to understand flows, 
we must understand networks—the relations between objects that comprise the system 
of the city. Drawing on the complexity sciences, social physics, urban economics, 
transportation theory, regional science, and urban geography, and building on his own 
previous work, Batty introduces theories and methods that reveal the deep structure of 
how cities function. 

Use of WPS to “wrap” cloud computing has been successful for big data analytics and is 
directly applicable to the analytics considered in the new science of cities. 

5.3.8 Crowdsourcing 
Crowdsourcing and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can increase in 
accessibility by making the data open with open standards.  Many of the existing 
crowdsourcing applications are “stovepipes” from the sensor to the browser.  Application 
of OGC standards is key to making this truly open data. 

The concept of using a Web Feature Service in combination with a Sensor Observation 
Service (SOS) for handling human as sensors is has been accomplished in past OGC 
initiatives51. A developed data model for VGI for Sensor Web was presented and 
illustrated with examples from Twitter, Flickr and from mobile devices directly.

SensorThings extends the OGC Sensor Web Enablement standards to Internet of Things 
environment.  SensorThings brings the robust semantics to this new emerging world of 
sensors truly everywhere. 

 
Figure 12.  Scope of SensorThings standards SWG 

There are many great new projects providing deployed sensors in cities, e.g., AirCasting52 
for noise and air quality and Array of Things53 for weather and air quality at a city block 
level of resolution.  One approach is to work with these projects to make their data 
available through open interfaces and therefore accessible for the wider benefits of an 
Open Smart Cities approach. 

5.3.9 Open Data for Smart Cities 
Open Data is a key enabler for informed public and for informed city officials.  Public 
ability to access and use data has grown with the growth of the Web.  Spatial open data 
and open data from many cities is bringing new opportunities for people to assess the 
situation from their perspective and thereby provide better input to collective decision 
making.  

OGC works with the open source geospatial promoters, e.g., OS Geo, LocationTech, 
Apache, etc.  Open data from for example, Open Street Map and Location Tech provide 
data that have been a boon to systems based on open standard services from OGC.

Annex A.  Open Standards Coordination for Smart Cities54 

A.1 OGC coordination with other Standards Developing Organizations 

This section provides a brief review of recent Smart City Standards activities by other 
Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).  

Because the need for spatial communication arises in so many different IT contexts, the 
standards development work of the OGC cannot happen in a geospatial technology silo 
separated from the larger world of information technology (IT). Therefore, the OGC 
makes significant efforts to liaise and collaborate with other SDOs. This kind of 
collaboration is critical in establishing a Smart Cities Spatial Information Framework. 

Since 1994, the OGC has maintained a close relationship with ISO/TC 211 (Geographic 
Information/Geomatics). Standards from the ISO 19100 series comprise significant topics 
of the OGC Abstract Specification. Further, the OGC standards WMS, GML, WFS, FE, 
O&M, and Simple Features. OGC's submission of its standards to ISO in a formal 
process for ISO adoption helps many organizations meet policy requirements or 
preference for de jure international standards. 

 

Figure 13.  Where the OGC fits in the standards world 

In the years since then, the OGC has developed formal relationships with other standards 
organizations, with the details of cooperation often codified in memoranda of 
understanding. OGC works with other SDO’s to help standardize the representation, 
processing and exchange of geospatial/location information in a consistent manner 
throughout the standards community.

A.2 International Standards activities on Smart Cities 

A.2.1 ITU Focus Group on Smart Sustainable Cities 

The ITU established a Focus Group on Smart Sustainable Cities (FG-SSC),55 which 
created a dozen documents. 

The FG-SSC Roadmap for Smart Sustainable Cities (SSC) Implementation identified the 
Key attributes of an SSC, most notably: a) Sustainability, b) Quality of Life, c) 
Intelligence or Smartness. 

The FG-SSC TR on Standardization Activities and Gaps for SSC was the Source of the 
Figure that is reused in JTC 1/SC 1 Report on standardization needs for Smart Cities56 

 

Figure 14.  The FG-SSC TR on Smart Sustainable Cities Infrastructure created this figure 
describing the Technical Architecture of a SSC. 

 

A.2.2 ISO/IEC JTC 1 Study Group 1 on Smart Cities 

ISO/IEC JTC 1 created a Study Group to review Smart City topics.  The Study Group 
was a short-term group that has now completed its report.  The report is posted for the

JTC 1 Plenary that will occur in November 2014.    One recommendation by the SG 1 is 
to create a new JTC 1 Special Working Group to continue the work. Figure 15 from the 
JTC 1 report shows potential relationships for SDO coordination on Smart City Standards 
model.  The JTC 1 SG 1 Smart Cities report includes these spatial items: 

 6.4.3 Facilitating Instrumentation, Analysis, Decision-Making, and Automation  
 Geospatial Information 
 7.5 GIS (Geographic Information System).  Note the “GIS” database in the figure. 

The JTC 1 report defines a Framework for Modeling Smart Cities based on RM-ODP.

ellipses were added by JTC 1 to approximately represent the core areas of ISO (red), ISO/IEC 

JTC 1 (blue), ITU-T (purple) and the IEC (green).

A.2.3 ISO Technical Management Board Task Force on Smart Cities 

The ISO Technical Management Board (TMB) established a Task Force on Smart Cities.  
A report was complete for the TMB meeting in February 2014.  Based on the report, the 
TMB created an Advisory Group on Smart Cities - to be led by the British Standards 
Institute (BSI).    

The ISO TMB Advisory Group (TAG) on Smart Cities now underway was directed to 
deliver its final report to the TMB's September 2015 meeting.  There was a TAG Smart 
Cities meeting during the Barcelona Smart Cities Expo in November 2014. 

A.2.4 ISO ISO/TC 268 - Sustainable development and resilience of communities 

The ISO TC 268 has developed these standards relevant to Smart Cities 

 ISO 37120 Sustainable development and resilience of communities — Indicators 
for city services and quality of life 

 ISO 37101 – Management Systems 
 ISO 37120 – Indicators for city services 
 ISO 37150 & ISO 37151 – smart infrastructure 

Example indicators from ISO/DIS 37120 were provided in an earlier section. 

A.3 National Standards Activities 

A.3.1 British Standards Institute 

The British Standards Institute (BSI)57 has published two Publicly Available 
Specification (PAS) documents on Smart City Framework (SCF): 

- PAS 180 - Smart Cities Vocabulary  
- PAS 181 – Smart city framework – Guide to establishing strategies for Smart 

Cities and communities 
- PAS 182, Smart city concept model  

BSI PAS 180 defines a Smart City as an effective integration of physical, digital and 
human systems in the built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive 
future for its citizens. 

PAS 181 defines a dozen Guidance Notes.  These three are particularly very relevant for 
location: 

- Transforming the City’s Operating Model re Information 
- Empowering Stakeholder-led Service Transformation 
- Mapping the City’s Interoperability Needs

PAS 181 also advocates using a SCF “pattern language” approach based on Christopher 
Alexander’s approach.   

PAS 182, Smart city concept model is a guide to establishing a model for data 
interoperability, which will provide a framework that can normalize and classify 
information from many sources so that data sets can be discovered and combined to gain 
a better picture of the needs and behaviors of a city’s citizens (residents and businesses). 

A.3.2 DKE/DIN Smart City Standardization Roadmap 

DKE/DIN58 published The German Standardization Roadmap Smart City, Version 1.  
The document provides a general outline as shown in Figure __ below.

http://www.cencenelec.eu/standards/Sectors/SmartLiving/smartcities/Pages/default.aspx  
 ETSI (ETSI - European Telecommunications Standards Institute) 
 IEEE has a Smart Cities website (http://smartcities.ieee.org/) providing 

information and news about IEEE events in targeted cities that feature experts in 
specific areas of focus. 

Many other organizations that are not SDOs have programs that focus on Smart Cities, 
such as the NIST Global Cities Challenge59, Brookings Institute60 and the Smart Cities 
Council. The OGC is on the Advisory Board of the Smart Cities Council and contributed 
to the Smart Cities Readiness Guide61.
