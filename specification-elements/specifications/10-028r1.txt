i. Preface 

This document has been written on the basis of a methodology developed within the 

GIGAS Support Action financed by the European Commission in order to address the 

convergence of global initiatives like GEOSS and the European interoperability 

initiatives developed in the context of the GMES programme like HMA - Heterogeneous 

Missions Accessibility and the INSPIRE  spatial data infrastructure legislation. 

The GEOSS, INSPIRE and GMES an Action in Support (GIGAS) promotes the coherent 

and interoperable development of the GMES, INSPIRE and GEOSS initiatives through 

their concerted adoption of standards, protocols, and open architectures. 

The methodology has been applied in the GIGAS project for a parallel analysis of 

GEOSS, INSPIRE, GMES, FP 6/7 projects and standardisation bodies, see [RD2] and 

[RD15].

Foreword 

Statement from Hugo De Groof – European Commission: Directorate-General 

Environment – Chief Scientist, Research and Innovation Unit 

 

The European Union's 6
th

 Environmental Action Programme 2001-2010 has set the 

framework for knowledge-based environmental policy making and assessment. It was 

shown early in the process that priority policy actions related to climate change 

mitigation and adaptation, the halting of the loss of biodiversity, environment and health 

and more sustainable strategies for natural resource and waste management require 

more timely, more accurate and more interoperable sources of information. A number of 

thematic strategies on the marine environment, pesticides, soils, air quality and the urban 

environment have led to the review and development of new elements of Community law 

in these areas, such as the Marine Strategy Directive, the Soils Thematic Strategy, the 

Pesticides Directive and the Clean Air for Europe Directive to name a few. In addition, 

following the severe social and economic impacts of natural disasters such as floods and 

forest fires which occurred with increasing intensity in the last decade, the Community 

decided on a legal framework for the management of floods and the further development 

of early warning and disaster response information systems. Together with the more 

traditional measures for controlling emissions and pollution at the source, a risk 

management and communication based approach has become a prominent part of the 

Communities legal framework and initiatives. 

To support the implementation of these policies, a number of obstacles related to the 

availability and the sharing of the required data sources had to be tackled. The INSPIRE 

directive has led to a roadmap of actions through which the necessary spatial data will 

become more easily discoverable and accessible for stakeholders having to implement 

the required information services. The GMES initiative of the Commission and the 

European Space Agency tackles issues related to collection of the needed data from 

space and terrestrial observation systems as well as the development of data processing 

services, which will enrich the data holdings too which stakeholders will have access 

through the INSPIRE architecture. Both GMES and INSPIRE fit and contribute to the 

GEO/GEOSS initiative as a regional contribution to the global ambition for developing a 

Global Earth Observation System of Systems. 

The GIGAS project plays an important role in this process as many actors active in these 

processes need to align their technical developments according to a commonly agreed 

framework of standards and architectural principles. A 'global to local' shared 

environmental information space and system requires a high degree of technical 

convergence and solid guidelines for achieving this are absolutely required. 

The GIGAS methodology and comparative analysis is a major contribution to achieving 

these goals.

Statement from Jay Pearlman, Co-chair, GEO Architecture and Data Committee 

 

GMES, INSPIRE, and GEOSS, are policies and initiatives that are affecting 

environmental information management, in Europe and beyond.  INSPIRE and GEOSS 

each address a different aspect of the need to have a coherent and sustainable 

interoperable data and information system that supports informed decision-making.  

Because of their different formations and approaches, there is not a consistent approach 

to architecture and interoperability between these activities. For example, there are 

differing emphases on the degree to which recognized standards play a core role in 

architecture frameworks. 

As part of its mission, GIGAS has examined the development of a consensus process that 

facilitates communication between GMES, INSPIRE, GEOSS including other European 

and international programs participating in GEOSS. A key to the process is the 

coordination with the bodies that develop international standards for geospatial and 

observational information. However, an effective process must address not only 

standards, but also the methodologies for understanding, implementing and analyzing the 

architectures and frameworks used in systems. 

This document defines a methodology to be used for analyzing and comparing different 

information and data management systems. This methodology addresses many aspects of 

system implementation, allowing evaluations in terms of business, enterprise, information 

and engineering and technology architecture, as well as their strategic alignment. From 

this perspective, the methodology has broad implications for the architecture of systems 

of systems, systems themselves and related components. Bringing together INSPIRE, 

GMES and GEOSS through the GIGAS project addresses the broad range of application 

environments that are necessary to test and validate the many aspects of interoperability. 

As a Co-chair of the GEO Architecture and Data Committee, I am pleased to express my 

support for this initiative of the GIGAS project and consortium to promote a methodology 

for the comparative analysis of interoperable systems. This is a significant effort in 

defining methodologies that supports the path forward in the GEOSS architecture and 

interoperability developments and a valuable tool for managing composite and multi-

actor scenarios.. 

Ultimately, the existence and convergence of parallel spatial data infrastructure 

initiatives, like the ongoing definition of the implementing rules for the INSPIRE 

Directive, demands a high level of consistency and accepted methodologies, which at 

European level is addressed in the GIGAS Support Action financed by the Directorate 

General Information Society of the European Commission.

Introduction 

The methodology described into this document is one of the tools that the GIGAS 

consortium developed to examining the requirements, architectures and standards applied 

in the systems in order to provide an evaluation of them in terms of business, enterprise, 

information and engineering and technology architecture, as well as their strategic 

alignment. It has proven to be useful for analyzing and comparing different systems and 

identifying areas of convergence, technology and interoperability gaps and as a tool for 

the technical dialogue across different user communities.

GIGAS Methodology for comparative analysis of information 
and data management systems 

1 Scope 

Information, including spatial information, is needed for the formulation and 

implementation of environmental policies and other European Community (EC) policies, 

which must integrate environmental protection requirements in accordance with Article 6 

of the Treaty. In order to bring about such integration, it is necessary to establish a 

measure of coordination between the users and providers of the information so that 

information and knowledge from different sectors can be combined. 

Measures are therefore required to reduce unnecessary duplication of data collection and 

to promote their harmonisation and dissemination and use. This should result in increased 

efficiency, the benefits of which can be reinvested in improving the availability and 

quality of information, thus stimulating innovation and supporting e-Governance 

services. Spatial information plays a key-role because it allows information to be 

integrated from a variety of disciplines for a variety of uses; it is fundamental building 

block of the emerging electronic participatory approach in democracy and public 

governance. 

Measures are being put in place. Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of 

the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the 

European Community (INSPIRE) lays down general rules to establish an infrastructure 

for spatial information in Europe for the purposes of Community environmental policies, 

and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. 

Furthermore Europe is addressing global issues related to the monitoring and 

management of global change phenomena and the need for security related observations 

with the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme for the 

implementation of information services to support decisions concerning environment and 

security. GMES is based on observation data received from Earth observation satellites 

and ground based information. GMES is jointly supported and financed by the European 

Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA), which develops the Space 

Component of GMES. In COM(2005)565 "GMES: From Concept to Reality", paramount 

for the GMES service component is the development of the Spatial Data Infrastructure as 

envisaged by INSPIRE. 

According to COM(2008) 46 "Towards a Shared Environmental Information System 

(SEIS)", priority will be given to INSPIRE implementation and further development of 

GMES , as a basis for improving respectively the sharing of environment-related data and 



OGC 10-028r1

information within Europe and the provision of services to public policy makers and 

citizens. 

Moreover, INSPIRE and GMES are contributions of the European Commission to the 

Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the related Global Earth Observation System of 

Systems (GEOSS).  

It is evident that INSPIRE, GEOSS, GMES and SEIS are policies and initiatives that are 

affecting environmental information management, in Europe and beyond. It is imperative 

that the information and communication technologies (ICT) underpinning the mentioned 

policy areas be aligned in order to interoperate reliably in a single information space. The 

project GEOSS, INSPIRE and GMES an Action in Support (GIGAS) contributes to this 

aim by promoting the coherent and interoperable development of the GMES, INSPIRE 

and GEOSS initiatives through their concerted adoption of standards, protocols, and open 

architectures. 

This document is one of the tools that the GIGAS consortium developed to examining the 

requirements, architectures and standards applied in the systems in order to provide an 

evaluation of them in terms of business, enterprise, information and engineering and 

technology architecture, as well as their strategic alignment. It has proven to be useful for 

analysing and comparing different systems and identifying areas of convergence, 

technology and interoperability gaps and as a tool for the technical dialogue across 

different user communities. 

This document has been written on the basis of a methodology developed within the 

GIGAS Support Action financed by the European Commission in order to address the 

convergence of global initiatives like GEOSS and the European interoperability 

initiatives developed in the context of the GMES programme like HMA - Heterogeneous 

Missions Accessibility and the INSPIRE  spatial data infrastructure legislation. 

The methodology has been applied in the GIGAS project for a parallel analysis of 

GEOSS, INSPIRE, GMES, FP 6/7 projects and standardisation bodies, see [RD2] and 

[RD15].

6 Methodology objectives 

The proposed methodology has been developed taking into account a certain number of 

high level objectives all aiming at ensuring that convergence efforts are directed towards 

consistent objectives. 

The proposed methodology shall 

1. empower each community with a neutral tool for comparison and convergence 

2. require limited resources for its use and exploitation  

3. allow a critical analysis to be performed by the initiative owners both at 

management and technical level so that decision makers can be involved in the 

process 

4. be scalable as what concerns the number of systems and initiatives addressed 

5. allow to analyse and compare the objectives and business models of systems and 

initiatives,  

6. allow to analyse high level requirements, scenarios and use cases,  

7. provide an identification of interoperability gaps, areas of possible convergence  

8. be tuned towards high level analysis and identification of areas of convergence - 

the design of the architectures of the contributing initiatives is outside the scope 

of this methodology 

9. be based on the re-use of well known and proven methodologies  

As a consequence of the above high level objectives and on the basis of experience the 

methodology has been based on the re-use for analysis and comparison purposes (i.e. not 

for system design) of the well known Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing 

(RM-ODP).  

As an example, the applicability of the proposed methodology within the GEOSS context 

is twofold; 

 within the GEO Architecture Data Committee (ADC) it may be exploited to 

perform a characterization and high level analysis of the architectures of the 

initiatives and systems contributing to GEOSS thus allowing a more effective 

discussion on convergence issues and remedies to identified gaps

7 Description of Convergence Process  

The convergence process addressed by this methodology consists of the following steps: 

 Identification of convergence objectives 

 Technology Watch 

 Comparative Analysis 

 Convergence Management 

 

Figure 1 Process Overview 

The identification of convergence objectives is mainly a collection of the high level 

requirements aiming to identify the interoperability opportunities among the systems

under analysis. The goal is to refine the scope and targets of the activity. The activity 

involves the so-called stakeholders and user communities (e.g. users or customers or 

designers or owners etc.) of the systems under analysis, providing their inputs based on 

their needs. 

The Technology Watch consists of a parallel monitoring of the target systems in terms 

of requirements, standards, services, architecture, models, processes and the consensus 

mechanisms with the same elements of the other systems under analysis.  

The Technology Watch will be based on a study using the RM-ODP methodology and 

the related five viewpoints. 

Technology watch is followed by a Comparative Analysis on solutions, requirements, 

architecture, models, processes and consensus mechanisms of the analysed systems.  

The result of the Comparative Analysis will include: 

 A set of conclusions summarising the result of the study including the 

identification of technological gaps among the target systems to be explored; 

 A list of recommendations/issues for the target systems to be expanded and 

processed in depth in a possible following Convergence Management phase; 

 An analysis on the schedules of the target systems with Identification of key 

milestones or intervention points, in order to match the necessary deadlines, to 

provide timely inputs and to receive timely outputs. 

Technology Watch and Comparative Analysis result are presented into a technical note. 

The Convergence Management is the phase of outreach and possibly shaping. The 

results of the analysis mainly in terms of recommendations and issues are made public 

and the target systems and stakeholders are addressed. This phase is out of the scope of 

this methodology.  

The above process may be repeated in several iterations.

8 Methodology 

8.1 Overview 

8.1.1 Introduction to RM-ODP 

The RM-ODP (ISO/IEC 10746-1:1998) [RD6] is an international standard for 

architecting open, distributed processing systems. It provides an overall conceptual 

framework for building distributed systems in an incremental manner. The viewpoints of 

the RM-ODP standards have been widely adopted: they constitute the conceptual basis 

for the ISO 19100 series of geomatics standards (normative references in ISO 

19119:2005), and they also have been employed in the OMG object management 

architecture.  

In addition to the viewpoints, RM-ODP defines a language for each of the viewpoints. 

This methodology is not using the RM-ODP Languages. Consideration will be given to 

the use of UML in the various viewpoints. 

The RM-ODP approach has been used in the design of the OpenGIS Reference Model 

(OGC 2003) with respect to the following two aspects:  

 It constitutes a way of thinking about architectural issues in terms of fundamental 

patterns or organizing principles, and 

 It provides a set of guiding concepts and terminology.  

Systems resulting from the RM-ODP (called ODP systems) approach are composed of 

interacting objects whereby in RM-ODP an object is a representation of an entity in the 

real world. It contains information and offers services. 

Based on this understanding of a system, ISO/IEC 10746 specifies an architectural 

framework for structuring the specification of ODP systems in terms of the concepts of 

viewpoints and viewpoint specifications, and distribution transparencies. 

The viewpoints identify the top priorities for architectural specifications and provide a 

minimal set of requirements—plus an object model—to ensure system integrity. They 

address different aspects of the system and enable the ‗separation of concerns‘. 

Five standard viewpoints are defined: 

 The enterprise viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment that 

focuses on the purpose, scope and policies for the system. 

 The information viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment that 

focuses on the semantics of the information and information processing 

performed. 

 The computational viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment that 

enables distribution through functional decomposition of the system into objects 

which interact at interfaces. 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 11 
 

 The engineering viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment that 

focuses on the mechanisms and functions required to support distributed 

interaction between objects in the system. 

 The technology viewpoint: A viewpoint on the system and its environment that 

focuses on the choice of technology in that system. 

The distributed aspect of an ODP system is handled by the concept of distribution 

transparency. Distribution transparency relates to the masking from applications the 

details and the differences in mechanisms used to overcome problems caused by 

distribution. According to the RM-ODP, application designers simply select which 

distribution transparencies they wish to assume and where in the design they are to apply. 

The RM-ODP distinguishes between eight distribution transparency types. These 

distribution transparencies consider aspects of object access, failure of objects, location 

of objects, as well as replication, migration, relocation, persistence and transactional 

behaviour of objects. 

More recently than the initial publication of RM-ODP, the ISO 19793:2008 standard has 

been published addressing how to use UML with RM-ODP [RD11].  ISO/IEC 19793 

applies UML as an alternative to the viewpoint languages in the original ISO 

10746:1998.  The ISO 19793 UML is an improvement over the ISO 10746 viewpoint 

languages.  The UML for RM-ODP are useful for the methodology purposes but will not 

be used directly.  The UML for RM-ODP does improve our understanding and use of the 

RM-ODP viewpoints.  In particular two of the summary descriptions from ISO/IEC 

19793 are useful for the methodology (See Figure 2): 

 The engineering viewpoint addresses:  "Solution Types and Distribution - 

Infrastructure required to support distribution" 

 The technology viewpoint addresses:  "Implementation - System hardware and 

software and actual distribution" 



OGC 10-028r1

Figure 2  RM-ODP Viewpoints from ISO/IEC 19793 

The RM-ODP has been used in the FP6 ORCHESTRA Project [RD1] and in the 

Heterogeneous Mission Accessibility Project [RD5]. 

The RM-ODP including the UML version has been used in the GEOSS Architecture 

Implementation Pilot.  

8.1.2 Mapping of RM-ODP to the Methodology 

An RM-ODP-based approach has been selected as a structural framework for the 

Technology Watch step of this methodology. The reason for this choice is as follows:  

 RM-ODP is currently popular and widely used i.e. most of the systems to be 

analysed and compared may already be based on RM-ODP, 

 it supports aspects of distributed processing, 

 it aims at fostering interoperability across heterogeneous systems, and 

 it tries to hide as much as possible consequences of distribution to systems 

developers. 

However, as most of the systems to be considered have the characteristic of a loosely-

coupled network of systems and services instead of a ―distributed processing system 

based on interacting objects‖, the RM-ODP concepts are not followed literally, they 

rather have to be interpreted and tailored for the purpose. For instance, most of the 

concepts of the architectures under consideration are not specified in terms of the RM-



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 13 
 

ODP distribution transparencies as these are specified in terms of interacting objects 

instead of interacting services. 

The usage of RM-ODP for Technology Watch is two-fold: 

1. Architectural analysis: It is used as a common structural means to describe the 

major architectural characteristics of the projects and initiatives under 

consideration. This approach enables a comparison and a synopsis of the different 

architectures on a high level. It is performed for systems of systems, projects and 

initiatives. Its purpose is to identify possibilities but also major obstacles for 

interoperability. Furthermore, it identifies the major use cases to be analysed in 

more detail. 

2. Component Implementation Analysis: It is used as a structural means to describe 

how selected use cases of the projects and initiatives are implemented in the 

different architectures. This second application of the RM-ODP enables a 

comparison and a synopsis on a more detailed level. Its purpose is to identify 

technological gaps and concrete problems of interoperability. It is therefore 

performed only for selected use cases such as access control or the discovery of 

services. 

An example of GEOSS architectural analysis is presented in annex 2.  

The following table contains a mapping of the RM-ODP viewpoints to the methodology 

elements. In detail: 

 The first column provides the original RM-ODP definitions of the viewpoints.  

 The second column indicates the mapping of the viewpoints to the technology 

watch and their interpretation for the next comparative architectural analysis.  

 The third and fourth columns provide examples of what will be defined in the 

viewpoints.

8.2 Identification of Convergence Objectives  

The RM-ODP based analysis is assumed to start after a preliminary activity of 

identification of convergence objectives. This activity is expected to lead to a collection 

of high level interoperability requirements. 

These requirements shall be collected from the analysis of the technical baselines of the 

systems under analysis and from the user needs of the stakeholders and user communities 

of the systems under analysis. 

In addition a key element will be the expertise of the analysis team and the know-how on 

the systems and on the relevant interoperability issues. 

The identification of convergence objectives aims to select candidate/possible situations 

where 

 Elements/components/aspects show similarities among the different systems 

allowing an interoperability with (limited) changes 

 Aspects of single systems with interoperability barriers towards the other systems 

which can be removed or bypassed with minor or major effort yielding significant 

benefits  

A preliminary analysis based on a set of criteria should lead to identify the most attractive 

features/aspects to be analysed in the next RM-ODP study phase. Candidate criteria are: 

 Cost-benefit trade-off 

Consider the benefits deriving from the enhanced interoperability with respect to 

the estimated effort necessary to implement the (technical) solutions needed for 

removing or reducing the existing interoperability gaps and barriers. 

 Governance 

Evaluate the possibility of influencing the systems with the proposed solutions; 

take into account the level of support provided by the entities governing the 

systems.  

 Analysis team know-how 

Select features/aspects which are well known inside the analysis team, with one or 

more partners having a solid and consolidated background and expertise across 

different systems, aiming to arrive to successful interoperability solutions. 

 Schedule 

Evaluate if the solutions match with the internal schedule of the systems, i.e. if 

there are opportunities to frame the outputs into relevant milestones of the 

systems. E.g. if a system is going to choose a standardisation decision at a certain 

date, the analysis team may try to propose a solution in time to be adopted by the 

target system. 

 Previous feedbacks  



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 15 
 

Consider how the systems have taken into account (e.g. immediate adoption, 

rejection, discussion and next adoption with minor/major modifications etc) 

previous inputs coming from different sources. Sort the features/aspects giving a 

priority to those which are envisaged to be accepted by the systems. 

 Long term perspective and global scenario 

Try to understand and/or to guess what is happening at global level and what is 

going to happen not only in the near future but also in the mid-term and in the 

long term. Try to prioritise features/aspects leading to solutions with expected 

long term validity. See what happens in other initiatives at world/global level and 

the general trends in standardisation bodies. 

A further effort (if needed/relevant) shall lead to the definition of other requirements, 

filling gaps and completing the picture (e.g. performance, security, safety, operational, 

quality).

8.3 Technology Watch 

8.3.1 Overview 

The following sections describe how to collect and organize information from the 

systems under analysis using the RM-ODP.   

The critical analysis of the high level Interoperability requirements extracted at the 

previous step aims to drive a study made in parallel on the different systems identifying 

architectural issues or solutions supporting the scenario in terms of 

 removing interoperability barriers, 

 facilitating convergence, 

 leading to standardisation. 

In most cases a complete architectural design is not requested and a basic study 

identifying key aspects, solutions and design choices is expected. 

A key aspect should be surveying the technologies of the selected looking for similarity 

and differences. Of particular interest will be when systems have similar requirements but 

have chosen differing technologies that prevent interoperability. 

In order to perform a proper survey it is recommended to perform an intermediate step of 

terminology harmonisation. 

The editors are expected to provide contributions to the analysis documents according 

with the templates described into the following sections and they shall reflect the 

structure of annex 2 of this document, with the same sub-sections and the same 

framework. 

The RM-ODP study shall be made with the aim to provide an output to be compared with 

similar studies on other initiatives/projects. 

As a general rule the RM-ODP study of a system shall be focused on interoperability 

aspects with the other initiatives.  

The example in annex 2 shall be used as a valid input in terms of which structure is 

expected and what kind of information shall be provided in each section.  

The document contributions shall be organised according the five viewpoints of the RM-

ODP, i.e. 

 Enterprise viewpoint, 

 Information viewpoint, 

 Service viewpoint 

 Engineering Viewpoint 

 Technology Viewpoint 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 17 
 

The sections for each viewpoint shall be prepared using  

 the criteria outlined into the following sections ―objectives‖ 

 the templates specified into the following sections ―documentation‖. 

The example in annex 2, both in terms of structure and contents, shall be a valid support 

and starting point for the analysis.

Table 1 Mapping of the RM-ODP Viewpoints to methodology 

 

Note:  In order to highlight the fact, that the architectures under consideration have 

often the nature of a loosely-coupled distributed system based on networked services 

rather than a distributed application based on computational objects, the 

“computational viewpoint” is referred to as “service viewpoint” in the methodology. 

Note: The use of RM-ODP shall be tailored in order to take into account that each of 

the systems is predominantly, but not exclusively SOA. For example the GEOSS 

architecture includes data delivery by broadcast and by media.  

CCSDS has produced a tailoring of the RM-ODP for space data systems, the Reference 

Architecture for Space Data Systems [RD9]. RASDS provides guidelines for the 

description of space data systems that take into account the realities of operating in the 

space environment. RASDS directly addresses the fact that some elements of these 



OGC 10-028r1 

20  
 

distributed systems will be operated at great distances from one another with one-way 

light times measured in tens of minutes or hours, not milliseconds. These elements may 

only occasionally be in contact with one another, typically require use of very expensive 

and over-subscribed ground communications assets, and are strongly affected by the 

physical environment in which they have to operate. These environmental issues affect 

what must be done to provide reliable communications between elements, how control 

interactions may be designed, and how these systems may be operated.  

In addition, Annex 5 contains a mapping of the RM-ODP viewpoints on the GEO AIP 

viewpoints. 

8.3.2 Enterprise Viewpoint 

8.3.2.1 Objectives 

The Enterprise Viewpoint shall focus on the purpose, scope and policies of the system 

under analysis. 

The Enterprise Viewpoint represents the system in the context of the business 

environment in which it operates. It is represented by a community of enterprise objects 

and by their roles (e.g. users, owners and providers of information). 

The Enterprise Viewpoint starts with the critical analysis and the refinement of the high 

level interoperability requirements identified by the previous phase. The rules specified in 

Annex 3 for writing requirements are a valid support for the successful result of this 

activity. 

In addition, the chosen approach for enterprise viewpoint is to apply use cases as a 

modelling tool. The concept of use case is adopted from the UML modelling approach. 

For each system under analysis create one or more interoperability use cases. 

The use case shall: 

 describe the behavior of the initiatives, 

 identify external actors/interfaces, 

 be focused on interoperability issues. 

The following topics should be tackled by the use case description, selecting those which 

are relevant for the scenario under analysis 

 Customer identification and needs, high level objectives & requirements 

Which are the external actors of the scenario, in particular the final targets of the 

service/data; which are their requirements at user level. 

 Architecture & Interoperability Barriers 

Identify specific architecture solutions or issues relevant for the interoperability 

scenario; identify barriers preventing or reducing interoperability. 

 Operational Concepts 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 21 
 

Identify any operational issue or constraint which may affect the interoperability 

scenario.  

 Standards, Maturity, Planning, Strategy for Implementation/take-up 

Make an inventory of the existing standards relevant for the scenario, evaluate 

their completeness and maturity, as well as their or weak points; analyse their 

diffusion, scope and applicability; identify areas needing a (further) 

standardisation and sketch a possible plan and/or a strategy for implementation or 

take-up at the relevant levels. 

 IPR, Data Policies, Identity Management, Information Security, 

Dealing with interoperability of large systems/systems of systems it is of 

paramount importance the analysis of issues affecting IPR and data policies as 

well security issues in terms of user/identity management and information 

security. 

 Test Conformance, 

Identify any issue related to conformance testing, the need of a conformance test 

platform, i.e. a persistent testbed, consider sustainability and governance. In case 

of standardisation extend the concept of conformance testing to certification. 

 Governance. 

Analyse any aspect of governance also in the perspective of a future shaping. 

8.3.2.2 Documentation 

The enterprise viewpoint section of the document shall consist of the following 

subsections: 

 Summary Table: a description the system under analysis to be provided using the 

table in Annex 2.1, which is self explanatory and provides a top level description. 

The summary table is significant for analysis on systems or systems of system; it 

is not mandatory for studies at subsystem or component level. 

 Context: A description of the overall context, 

 The list of the high level (interoperability) requirements, 

 The identified interoperability use cases described with the tables based on the 

template in annex 1. 

8.3.3 Information Viewpoint 

8.3.3.1 Objectives 

The Information Viewpoint shall describe any data/metadata relevant for the scenario 

under analysis with a parallel view of what happens in the different initiatives. 



OGC 10-028r1 

22  
 

The Information Viewpoint summarises the modelling approach of all categories of 

information the architecture of a given project or system deals with. This includes the 

way how information models are specified, i.e. the set of rules and the notation that is 

used in order to define information objects and their relations among them. Sometimes 

this approach is summarised as a meta-model for information. An example of such a 

meta-model is the General Feature Model (GFM) as specified in ISO 19109 and applied 

in the OGC Reference Model (OGC 03-040). 

The resulting information models (sometimes also called application schemas) include 

object types (in the GFM called feature types) that include thematic, spatial, temporal 

characteristics as well as their meta-data. It shall be distinguished between models on the 

abstract or on concrete service platforms (to be described in the technology viewpoint). 

8.3.3.2 Documentation 

The information viewpoint of the system under analysis shall be provided by 

 Identifying the list of information models of the initiative/project which are 

relevant for the interoperability scenario under investigation 

 describing each information model with the same tables in Annex 2.2.  

The editor shall provide a description in terms of information models of his system with 

the same type of information present in the example in the annex. 

The information modelling approach of a project/initiative shall be analysed according to 

the following list: 

 model name 

 category 

o One of the following categories shall be used 

 meta-model for information (e.g. the OGC General Feature 

Model), i.e. guidelines and rules how to specify information 

models resp. application schemas 

 meta-model for services (e.g. the ORCHESTRA Service meta-

model), i.e. guidelines and rules how to specify services and 

interfaces 

 basic model, i.e. generic application schemas that need refinements 

for a specific application domain. Example: OGC Observations & 

Measurements Model 

 thematic model, i.e. an application schema for a particular 

application domain (e.g. forest fire risks), built according to the 

meta-model for information 

 meta-information model, i.e. the model used for expressing meta-

data/meta-information. Example: ISO 19115 or ISO 19119

 comment 

In addition UML diagrams may be provided on a case by case basis in order to complete 

the picture. 

8.3.4 Service Viewpoint 

8.3.4.1 Objectives 

The Service Viewpoint summarises the modelling approach of the Interface and Service 

Types. This includes the way how interface and service models are specified, i.e. the set 

of rules and the notation that is used in order to define services. Sometimes this approach 

is summarised as a meta-model for services. An example of such a meta-model is the 

meta-model for services as specified in the Reference Model for the ORCHESTRA 

Architecture (RM-OA) [RD1]. 

The resulting service models include the interfaces of the services, their operations as 

well as operation parameters and exceptions. Furthermore, it encompasses meta-

information about the services, e.g. OGC capabilities It shall be distinguished between 

services on the abstract or on concrete service platforms (to be described in the 

technology viewpoint). 

8.3.4.2 Documentation 

The service viewpoint of the system under analysis shall be provided by 

 Identifying the list of services of the initiative/project which are relevant for the 

interoperability scenario under investigation 

 describing each service with the same table used in Annex 2.3.  

The partner shall provide a description in terms of services of his project/initiative with 

the same type of information present in the example in the annex. 



OGC 10-028r1 

24  
 

Before listing the service and interface types, it shall be specified 

 if and if yes, which service meta-model is being used, i.e. which models and rules 

are applied for the specification of services and interfaces. 

Example: Reference to ―W3C Web Service Architecture‖ or ―OASIS Reference 

Model for Service Oriented Architecture 1.0‖ or ―Reference Model for the 

ORCXHESTRA Architecture (RM-OA) OGC 07-097‖ 

 if and if yes which service taxonomy has been applied for the project/initiative.

8.3.5 Engineering Viewpoint 

8.3.5.1 Objectives 

The Engineering Viewpoint focuses on the mechanisms and functions required to support 

distributed interactions between resources (e.g. services) in the system.  

The engineering viewpoint of each system should  

 allocate services and data to component types and instance  

 list all those major architectural features for which there is a defined workflow, 

policy or service interaction model and model them in UML sequence diagrams.  

The Sequence Diagrams model the systems and their external interfaces exchanging 

messages according with the interoperability schema under analysis. 

8.3.5.2 Documentation 

In the tailoring proposed by this methodology (see annex 2.4) the Engineering Viewpoint 

is assumed to describe: 

 Component Types: allocation of services and data allocated to component types. 

 Description of the distributed computing environment that supports the interaction 
between component instances 

 Engineering policies: defining a set of relevant aspects that we are interested to, e.g. 
Access control, security, etc.). Their dynamic behaviour may be described in terms of use 
cases and service interaction diagrams, e.g. as UML sequence diagrams. 

 Implementation Architecture: defining the architecture of the system and how the 
instances of the component types are allocated and implemented. 

8.3.5.2.1 Component Types 

This viewpoint describes how the mapping of abstract service specifications and 

information models to the chosen component types.   

The component types define the packaging approach for deployment. Systems have in 

some cases already defined component types so this viewpoint provides a description of 

those components by abstracting the implementation details and focusing on the 

interfaces and information content. 



OGC 10-028r1

8.3.5.2.2 Distributed Computing Environment 

This section describes the distributed computing environments used in the systems. In 

case of a service-oriented environment it describes the choices of the service platforms 

with their major characteristics (e.g. architectural styles).  

As a general guideline, the specification of a service platform shall be conformant to the 

OASIS Reference Model for Service Oriented Architecture 1.0 [RD3]. This implies that 

the platform is being described according to the SOA-RM by the following predefined 

platform properties (examples for a W3C Web Services platform as applied in the SANY 

Integrated Project [RD4] are given for the individual properties, respectively): 
 Platform Name 

Name of the platform and if applicable the exact version number of the platform 
specification. 
In the case of a standard platform, a reference shall be provided. 

Example: “W3C Web Services Platform” following the Web Service infrastructure as 
defined by the W3C specifications 

 Reference Model 

If the platform specification is based on a specific reference model, the name and the 
exact version number of the reference model shall be provided. 

Example: W3C Web Services Architecture 

 Interface Language 

Specification of the formal machine-processable language used to define Service 
Interfaces. In the case of a standard language, a reference shall be provided. 

Example: Web Service Description Language (WSDL), Version 1.1 

 Execution Context 

Specification of the Execution Context. The Execution Context is an agreement between 
service providers and consumers. It contains information that can include preferred 
protocols, semantics, policies and other conditions and assumptions that describe how a 
service can and may be used. This includes, for example, the specification of the 
transport and the security layer, the format of the messages exchanged between service 
providers and consumers, etc. In the case of a standard Execution Context, a reference 
shall be provided. 

Example: The execution context of the W3C Web Services Platform is defined by 

the following properties: 

 Transport Protocol and Message Format: 

SOAP 1.2 HTTP binding as defined in SOAP Part 1: Message 

Framework, Version 1.2 and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), 

Version 1.1. The message style that shall be used is document/literal 

non-wrapped since it is the most widely accepted and interoperable 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 27 
 

message style. 

 Security 

Session Information: The transport of session information may be 

accomplished by using platform specific mechanisms, for example the 

inclusion of a session key in the SOAP header. 

Encryption: Optional encryption of SOAP messages shall be 

accomplished by Web Services Security: 4 SOAP Message Security 1.1. 

 Schema Language 

Specification of the schema language used to define Information Models.  

Example: Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 

 Schema Mapping 

Specification of how to map the abstract level (UML) to the schema language used for 
this particular platform (if applicable). 

Example: ISO 19136 for GML 

8.3.5.2.3 Engineering policies 

This section is expected to define the engineering policies applied on a set of relevant 

aspects that we are interested to. 

The engineering policies describe rules, constraints, recommendations or (real-life) 

examples of service interactions in order to fulfil a given task, e.g. access control for 

operation calls, or monitoring of services. All these policies must rely upon specifications 

provided in the Information and/or Service Viewpoint. 

These specifications may be  

 abstract (i.e. platform-neutral) or  

 concrete (i.e. platform-specific)  

depending on the level of abstraction to which the system/component/architecture 

specification belongs to. 

For instance, a project and/or an initiative may define policies for the following aspects 

(non-exhaustive list): 

 resource discovery 

 service monitoring and management 

 access control 

 processing of quality information 



OGC 10-028r1 

28  
 

 event generation and handling 

The Engineering Viewpoint shall describe any processing relevant for the engineering 

policies, preferably if available in UML sequence diagrams. An example is a defined 

workflow for access control or for the discovery of services based on 

registries/catalogues. Each policy of the enterprise viewpoint shall be expanded into one 

or more sequence diagrams detailing the interactions among the actors. 

Sequence Diagrams model the initiatives and their external interfaces exchanging 

messages according with the interoperability schema under analysis, with a parallel view 

of what happens in the different initiatives. 

The focus shall be on the Interoperability aspects to be modelled, identifying barriers but 

also commonalities 

If necessary other type of information can be provided as integration in order to provide a 

more complete picture. 

8.3.5.2.4 Implementation Architecture 

This section describes concrete arrangements of component types following the 

engineering policies and based upon component implementations and the run-time 

environment identified and described in the Technology Viewpoint. 

The rationale of this section is to describe how the component types are combined into a 

system architecture in order to implement data and services/operations described into 

information and service viewpoints. 

For clarity sake, Section "Component types" lists and describes each type of component 

one by one; section "Implementation architecture" describes how the building blocks 

(component types) are assembled and perform the interactions described into the section 

"Engineering policies". 

Note that this section may be empty if a project or and initiative stays on an abstract 

architectural level. An alternative in this case may be to describe an implementation 

architecture of a pilot application as an example. 

8.3.6 Technology Viewpoint 

8.3.6.1 Objectives 

The technology viewpoint of the system under analysis shall be provided by defining 

 the run time environment  

 the status of the standardisation process (if any) 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 29 
 

8.3.6.2 Documentation 

The Technology Viewpoint deals with the following items relevant for the 

interoperability scenario:  

 Component Implementation 

 Run-time environment 

 Deployed Service Instances and Service Networks. 

 Standardisation processes. 

The editor shall provide a description in terms of technology baseline of his 

project/initiative with the same type of information present in the example in the annex 

2.5. 

8.3.6.2.1 Component Implementation 

This section shall give implementation details on the components types identified into the 

engineering viewpoint. Details include: 

 The tools that support the implementation of the component types; 

 The products that provide implementations of the component types. 

8.3.6.2.2 Deployed Service Instances and Networks 

This section contains the listing of the service instances and service networks deployed 

by the Initiatives. A service network is hereby considered as a set of service instances 

(also called a domain) that follows a common set of engineering policies as defined in 

section 8.3.5.2.3 

8.3.6.2.3 Run-time environment 

This section shall provide information about the software components (e.g. product 

name) that is being used as the run-time environment for the service instances and service 

networks. 

Examples: EJB Application Server for services, ESA SSE for the client applications. 

The relevance of the run-time Environment on the scope of the activities will be 

evaluated on a case by case basis. 

8.3.6.2.4 Standardisation Process 

This section shall provide information about past, ongoing or planned standardisation 

activities of a project or an initiative. The list shall be concrete in the sense that it may be 

officially referenced as a new work item, discussion paper, draft specification, 

recommendation, request for comment, depending on the rules of the standardisation 

body, respectively. Each item in the list shall include the date of the original submission 

and the current status accompanied by a date.

8.4 Comparative Analysis  

8.4.1 Overview 

The comparative analysis task consists of a critical analysis of the technology watch 

reports, i.e. a set of parallel analysis on the different initiatives of features and 

architecture aspects. The comparative analysis expected outputs are 

 A conclusion at the end of the technical note summarising the result of the study 

including the identification of technological gaps and guidelines and objectives 

for the harmonisation approach  

 (optional) A list of recommendations/issues to the target systems to be expanded 

and processed in depth in a future convergence management (shaping) phase; the 

issues are based on the analysis on the schedules of the systems in order to match 

the necessary deadlines, to provide timely inputs and to receive timely outputs. 

8.4.2 Comparative Analysis Section in Technical Note 

The Comparative Analysis section of the technical note consists of a synthesis of the 

technology watch studies performed for the different systems. 

The section shall identify the most significant gaps and commonalities coming out from 

the technology watch describing interoperability issues and opportunities. 

The section contains the following sub-sections: 

 Overview 

A summary of the previous technology watch report activity, consisting of a short 

description of the analysed systems and the most relevant issues detected. 

 Opportunity for Interoperability 

A focus on the most significant interoperability issues coming out from the 

technology watch activity. 

 Comparative Analysis 

 A parallel analysis on the systems and on the features candidate for 

interoperability. For clarity sake it is suggested to use matrixes with 

features/systems as rows/columns for an immediate view on gaps and 

commonalities. See example in table below from [RD15]  

 Open issues and future work items 

It lists issues remaining open waiting for new studies.

8.4.3 Issues and recommendations 

8.4.3.1 Overview 

The list of issues (or recommendations) may be extracted as a final result of the 

comparative analysis on the basis of a critical analysis of the technology watch reports 

based on a set of criteria used. 

Issues are suggestions addressed to relevant entities with the purpose of improved 

interoperability. 

The following types of issues are envisaged: 

 Revising existing specifications/standards 

 Perform (additional) testing on subjects 



OGC 10-028r1 

32  
 

 Further investigation about the subject 

 Communication 

 Submission for consideration as reference material 

 Funding 

 Research 

 Governance/Political 

 (Other TBD) 

The entities to be addressed are mainly the teams in charge of the target systems. 

8.4.3.2 Criteria  

The following criteria are envisaged to define issues/recommendations and to identify 

priorities: 

 Cost-benefit trade-off 

Consider the benefits deriving from the enhanced interoperability with respect to 

the effort necessary to implement the solutions in the issues removing or reducing 

interoperability gaps and barriers. 

 Governance 

Evaluate the possibility of influencing the systems with the proposed issues; take 

into account the level of support provided by the entities governing the systems.  

 Schedule 

Evaluate if the solutions specified by the issues match with the internal schedule 

of the systems, i.e. if there are opportunities to frame the outputs into relevant 

milestones of the systems.  Consider also if the study timeframe is compatible 

with the time necessary to complete or at least to start-up a successful 

standardisation process or a shaping activity. 

 Previous feedbacks from the systems 

Consider how the systems have taken into account (e.g. immediate adoption, 

rejection, discussion and next adoption with minor/major modifications etc) 

previous inputs coming from different sources. Sort the issues giving a priority to 

those which are envisaged to be accepted by the systems.  

 Long term perspective and global scenario 

Try to understand and/or to guess what is happening at global level and what is 

going to happen not only in the near future but also in the mid-term and in the 

long term. Try to prioritise issues leading to solutions with expected long term 

validity. See what happens in other initiatives at world/global level and the 

general trends in standardisation bodies.

9.2.4 Engineering Viewpoint 

GEOSS is made up of components and the components expose services. A component represents a 
modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its 
environment. Components offer business functions as services. A component is modelled throughout the 
development life cycle and successively refined into deployment and run-time. Conceptually, component 
types are design concepts that encapsulate information objects and provide services on the information 
through interfaces. Component instances are developments that have been deployed and are accessible at 
a network address. 

9.2.4.1 Component Types 

The following are GEOSS component types: 

 Main GEO Web site: Earthobservations.org 

 GEO web portals: A single point of access to information, internal or external to GEOSS, relevant 
to all SBAs and is of interest to various types of users 

 GEOSS Registry: Component and Service Registry (CSR), Standards and Interoperability Registry 
(SIR), GEOSS Best Practices Wiki, GEOSS User Requirements Registry 

 GEOSS Clearinghouse : Provides search access to high-level metadata from all catalogs 
registered in the CSR through remote harvest of metadata or provision of distributed search. 
Indexes all CSR entries

and/or Community Catalogs) to determine the protocol needed to search for resources (e.g CSW 

2.0.2 or Z39.50) and the queryable elements of each as needed. Alternatively, the Client Application 

knows a-priori the protocol needed to interact with catalog(s)/clearinghouse(s) of interest 

Step 2: Client Application presents GEOSS User with search criteria based on queryable properties 

of selected catalogs 

- Simple keyword search and area of interest/bbox search 

- Advanced search parameters such as organization, catalogs to be searched, societal benefit areas, 

resource type, etc 

- More specific earth-observation criteria such as sensor row/path, collection, subsetting/ordering 

and/or delivery mechanisms, etc 

- Value-added and/or domain/community specific search capabilities such as thesaurus matching, 

cluster matching, etc 

Step 3: Based on user selections, Client Application constructs query to each selected catalog and 

the ResultSet is returned and presented to the user with application-specific options (such as total 

number of results, basic information about each result, grouping of results, etc) 

Step 4:  GEOSS User selects resources of interest for evaluation and/or use.  

Post Condition 

The Client Application has retrieved the necessary metadata to present the GEOSS User with 

information on discovered resources matching the search criteria for further evaluation and/or use.

9.2.4.3.2 Service Monitoring 

This use case describes the conditions and steps to interact with a Service Instance within GEOSS. This use case can be 

specialized to support a variety of GEOSS services and resources such as Sensor Planning Service, Ordering Service, 

Models, Sensor Observation Service, WCS over netCDF, WMS Cascading, WFS Simple, CAP Alerts atompub 

Service, etc.

9.2.4.3.3 Access Control 

The GEOSS Implementation Plan states that  

“The societal benefits of Earth observations cannot be achieved without data sharing. 

The following are GEOSS data sharing principles: 

 There will be full and open exchange of data, metadata, and products shared within GEOSS, recognizing 
relevant international instruments and national policies and legislation. 

 All shared data, metadata, and products will be made available with minimum time delay and at minimum 
cost. 

 All shared data, metadata, and products free of charge or no more than cost of reproduction will be 
encouraged for research and education. 

 



OGC 10-028r1 

42  
 

Use of data or products does not necessarily imply agreement with or endorsement of the purpose behind 

the gathering of such data.” 

Based on the requirement in the implementation plan, it can be expected that GEOSS access control will 
primarily be for authentication of users. However,the use of OGC web services within GEOSS implies that 
OGC GeoRM (formerly GeoDRM) will play a key role in GEOSS access control as it develops. 

9.2.4.3.4 Development Policies 

The GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) develops and deploys new process and infrastructure 
components for the GEOSS Common Infrastructure and the broader GEOSS architecture.  AIP is a core 
task (GEO Task AR-09-01b) of the GEO Architecture and Data Committee. Results of the AIP are 
transitioned to GEO Task AR-09-01a and the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI).  The OGC coordinates 
the AIP.  Progress of AIP development is listed at http://www.ogcnetwork.net/AIpilot 

9.2.4.4 Implementation Architecture 

Services can be classified into client, business process and access tiers. Client tier services provide the user 
interface of the system; the services include the GEO web site, GEOSS Web Portal, various community 
portals and client applications. The business process tier provides the computational and management 
functionality of the system; the services include the GEOSS registries, clearinghouse, alert servers, 
processing servers, portrayal servers, workflow management servers and other services. The access tier 
offers various data acquisition and dissemination services; for example GEONETCast, product access 
services, sensor web services, model access services and others. The following figure depicts these tiers. 

 

Figure 3 GEOSS Tiers 

Collectively all these services form the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI). Within the GCI, the web 
portal, registry and clearinghouse are the principal components for resource discovery. The web portal is the 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 43 
 

main application for accessing GEOSS services. The clearinghouse provides search capability across a 
distributed network of catalogue services. The registry publishes metadata describing components and 
services registered in GEOSS.  

An instantiation of the above architecture is being deployed under the Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility 
[RD5] initiative of the European Space Agency as shown on the next figure.  The Community Clients are the 
main applications for accessing the EO services. The EO Community Clearinghouse accessible from the 
GEO Web Portal provides search capability across a distributed network of catalogue services. The EO 
Community Service and Collection catalogue publishes ISO metadata describing Community resources e.g. 
EO dataset series (i.e. collections) and services registered and their interrelationships.  Types of service 
registered include catalogues, ordering services, sensor planning services and Web mapping services.  In 
addition, conformance test capabilities are available based on the OGC CTL language and the TEAM test 
engine. 

 

Figure 4 Example of GEOSS Tiers Instantiation for the European Union 

9.2.5 Technology Viewpoint 

The GEOSS Registry provides a catalogue of all registered components and services.  The following requirements 

apply to technologies contributed to GEOSS: 

 Upon registering a service, a service provider must specify the length of time for which the service will be 

offered (preferably ‗unlimited‘).   

 Experimental services will be registered and exempt from the level of service requirements. 

 Services are expected to be available at least 99% of the time, except when otherwise required by the nature 

of the service. This allows for approximately 7 hours of down time a month. Adequate network service must 

be utilized in order to provide this level of availability. 



OGC 10-028r1

 Non-functioning components of the Network will diminish the operational and marketing value of the 

Network in general for all participating organizations. Therefore, GEO may remove a listed server from the 

registry 

9.2.5.1 Component  Implementation 

It should be noted that GEOSS is a system of contributed systems, components and services. Therefore, contributors 
have adopted a variety of technologies for implementing the components contributed to GEOSS. In this sub-section we 

have selected some of the components and instances that have been used in the AIP and associated tasks. 

 Community portals: A community-focused portal (website) that provides a human user interface to 
identified content. Some of the component instances used include ESRI GIS Portal toolkit, 
Compusult, ESA/FAO portal products. 

 Client applications: Application hosted on users computer to access remote services and provide 
manipulation of the data in the client application. Clients may be specific to a user community or 
may be more generic geospatial data applications. Some of the clients that have been used to 
interact with GEOSS components during AIP-2 included web browsers (Internet Explorer, Mozilla 
Firefox), UDig (used as WPS client), Google Earth and ERDAS TITAN. 

 Community catalogues:  Collection of community-organized information descriptions (metadata) 
exposed through standard catalog service interfaces. Example component instances used include 
catalogue services(CSW) bundled with ESRI GIS Portal toolkit and another developed by George 
Mason University.  

 Workflow management: Encapsulates an engine capable of managing workflows, services, 
activities, and workflow execution instances. An example instance is BPELPower developed by 
George Mason University. GMU BPELPower BPEL engine is a generic BPEL workflow execution 
engine. Another workflow engine is Oracle BPEL Process Manager used by ESA Service Support 
Environment (SSE). 

 Processing services: Components that accepts requests to process data using an algorithm hosted 
in the component. The data is accessed from a remote service. The processing services used in 
AIP-2 were offered through instances of the 52North WPS. 

 GEONETCast: Global network of satellite-based data dissemination systems to distribute data via 
broadcast. The GEONETCast multicasting allows different datasets or EO products to be 
transmitted in parallel from satellites or in-situ sensors. Access to data is controlled and targeted to 
specific groups of users through a key access capability. The multicast capability uses a global 
network of communications satellites that includes direct-to-home (DTH) telecommunication 
satellites and Digital Video Broadcast (DVB). GEONETCast is describes in detail by Wolf L. and 
Williams M. (2008) "GEONETCast—Delivering Environmental Data to Users Worldwide" IEEE 
Systems Journal, pp. 401-405, 2(3) DOI 10.1109/JSYST.2008.925978 

9.2.5.2 Run-time Environment 

There are no requirements in GEOSS for specific run-time requirements. Components and Services within GEOSS are 

implemented in a variety of run-time environments.  

9.2.5.3 Deployed Service Instances and Networks 

The following are lists of Components and Services currently registered in the GEOSS Registry.

9.2.5.4 Standardisation Process 

During service registration, service providers enter references to interoperability arrangements adopted by their 

contributed services and components. Interoperability arrangements can include international standards such as those of 

the OGC, IEEE or W3C; but may also be special arrangements based on application-specific business rules. 

If the standard is not already a registered specification, it is assessed by the Standards and Interoperability Forum (SIF) 

then registered. The main purpose of the SIF is to ensure that GEOSS components can interoperate through one of the 

registered standards or other interoperability arrangements.  The SIF facilitated interoperability through technical 

analysis, advocacy, education and the provision of impartial advice on issues regarding standardisation and 

interoperability within GEOSS. The following figure illustrates the role of the SIF. 

 

Figure 5 SIF Role 

All registered standards are entered in the Standards and Interoperability Registry. The architectural role of the 

Standards and Interoperability Registry is depicted in the GEOSS Common Infrastructure described in the GEOSS 

Engineering Viewpoint sub-section of this chapter. 

The SIF promotes to form Regional Teams to have true global representation in supporting GEOSS interoperability.  A 

SIF European Team was promoted (see http://www.thegigasforum.eu/sif/ ). In this framework, the purpose of having a 

European Regional Team is to increase efficiency in carrying out the work of the SIF, addressing issues such as: 

 bring local knowledge and reach out multi-disciplinary and regional science Communities;

9.3 Annex 3 Requirements on Requirements 

The following requirements define a set of basic rules on how to write requirements. The 

rules are derived from ECSS E-10 6C [RD7] which can be used as a reference for writing 

requirements. 

 Each requirement shall be separately stated.  

 A requirement shall be self-contained. 

 Each requirement shall consist of a single sentence with ―shall‖ or ―should‖,  

Note: notes like this can be used to clarify the sense of the requirement  

 The verbal form ―shall‖ shall be used whenever a provision is a requirement. 

 The verbal form ―should‖ shall be used whenever a provision is a 

recommendation. 

 The verbal form ―may‖ shall be used whenever a provision is a permission. 

 The verbal form ―can‖ shall be used to indicate possibility or capability.  

 Requirements should be stated in performance or ―what-is-necessary‖ terms, as 

opposed to telling a supplier ―how to‖ perform a task, unless the exact steps in 

performance of the task are essential to ensure the proper functioning of the 

product. 

 Requirements should be expressed in a positive way, as a complete sentence (verb 

and noun). 

  The entity responsible of the technical requirement shall be identified. 

 All technical requirements shall be backwards-traceable and forwards-traceable. 

 Any detected ambiguity in a requirement shall be removed. 

 Each requirement shall be unique.  

 Each requirement shall have a unique identifier 

 A proposed syntax for the requirement identifier should be 

<project-acronym>-XXX-YYY-NNN 

Where  

 <project-acronym> is something like GEO 

 XXX is an identifier of the topic/working group, e.g. CAT for 

―‖Catalogue‖ 



OGC 10-028r1 

48  
 

 YYY is a 2nd level acronym e.g. FUN for functional, GEN for general, 

OPE for operational.. 

 NNN is a counter, it is suggested to start numbering requirements with a 

step of 10 (e.g. 010, 020 etc, in order to be able to insert new requirements 

later (e.g 011, 012 etc.) 

 The requirements should be grouped by type or in accordance with the different 

situations of the product or system life cycle in regard of the needs, the 

environmental conditions and the constraints. 

 The requirements shall be unambiguous and not in conflict with the other 

associated requirements in contractual documentation. 

 A priority should be identified for each requirement. 

 Each (performance) requirement shall be described in quantifiable terms. 

 Each (performance) requirement should include an attribute that defines the 

method used to determine the required performance. 

 A requirement shall be verifiable using one or more approved verification 

methods. 

 The following items (and similar ones) should not be used in a requirement 

o ―and/or‖, 

o ―etc‖, 

o ―goal‖, 

o ―shall be included but not limited to‖, 

o ―relevant‖, ―necessary‖, ―appropriate‖,

Summary 

“It is recommended 

 to GIGAS to define a sustainable model for a permanent test environment ('persistent research test-bed'), 

 to initiatives and organizations like INSPIRE/GEOSS/GMES/OGC/AGILE/EuroSDR and existing and future 

research projects to design, develop and test new types of interoperable geospatial services and interfaces in 

the context of this testbed, and 

 to the EC/EU and related organisations to foster research by offering this sandbox environment.

Additional information 

Context 

It is recommended to define a sustainable model for a persistent test-bed so that uptake of standards by industry and 

institutions is eased.The envisaged testbed is assumed to provide 

 An open, permanent infrastructure in which organisations or external projects can integrate their 

(compliant) services. 

 A permanent test environment to design, develop and test new services and service interfaces and to foster 

related research by to offering a sandbox for not yet established service types. 

 Optionally conformance test tools (as for example CITE). 

 A set of tools supporting the target interfaces (ideally offered as freely available open source tools). 

Full recommendation text 

It is recommended 

 to GIGAS to define a sustainable model for a permanent test environment ('persistent research test-bed'), 

 to initiatives and organizations like INSPIRE/GEOSS/GMES/OGC/AGILE/EuroSDR and existing and future 

research projects to design, develop and test new types of interoperable geospatial services and interfaces in 

the context of this testbed, and 



OGC 10-028r1 

Copyright © OGC 2010 51 
 

 to the EC/EU and related organisations to foster research by offering this sandbox environment. 

Rationale 

Although multiple and diverse testing activities exist among the initiatives and standardisation organisations, none of 

them provides a sustainable and persistent environment to test and develop new standards and data specifications. 

Each testing activity has to set up an own environment. This includes redundant time and effort from scratch, because 

in most cases, the same kinds of data and processing services are used. A persistent testbed could help to minimize 

these efforts by offering such services for a sustainable time period. More time can be spent for solving the real 

research problem. Besides, the services could be used to reliably serve teaching purposes and the various research 

outcomes can be offered for a longer time period instead of vanishing after a project is finished. This would improve 

the work of the whole geospatial interoperability research community in Europe. 

Dependencies 

Main discussion points 

To enable the persistent characteristics of the testbed, the maintenance of the offered services and the according 

management activities are a critical issue. Although this requires only a modicum of money and manpower, the funding 

has to be assured over years. 

Further background information 

The development of the business model for the testbed is carried out in strong cooperation with the 

AGILE/EuroSDR/OGC Persistent Testbed for Research and Teaching in Europe (PTB). A lot of information can be 

acquired from their website at http://plone.itc.nl/gitestbed. 

Roadmap 

The business model for the Persistent Testbed is tackled by the deliverable D3.5 “GIGAS Persistent Testbed Business 

Model”. Details can be found there as soon it is published (first draft in the end of September 2009). 

Follow-up

9.5 Annex 5 RM-ODP in GEO Architecture Implementation Pilot 

The GEO Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) is using the RM-ODP approach for its 

design. This approach has the advantage that the proposed methodology can be used 

as a tool to identify gaps and areas of convergence in parallel to the AIP design. 

The AIP is developing RM-ODP viewpoints using UML in accordance with the 

following principles: 

1. ―Creating explicit models of a system‘s design is the step leading from art to 

practice‖ is the approach taken by Christopher Alexander‘s Notes on the 

Synthesis of Form, and Eberhardt Rechtin‘ System Architecting.‖  The principal 

is that explicit models are needed for the community of interest for the system to 

inspect and critique in order to have an optimum development practice. 

2. ―Architecture practice requires description of the system from multiple 

viewpoints‖ is consistent with almost all International standards for architecture 

which consistently require a set of viewpoints, e.g., IEEE 1220, ISO/IEC 10746,  

ISO/IEC 19793  

3. ―System-of-system development requires iteration of design synthesis with 

existing implementations‖. There is no ―blank sheet‖ starting point for system 

development in a system of systems. The models can begin with abstracting the 

key design aspects from the deployed system.  Optimization is achieved through 

iterations of deployment analysis, design refinement and refinement of the 

deployments. 

The GEO AIP makes use of ISO/IEC 19793.  The following table summarizes the 

content of the viewpoints used in AIP:
