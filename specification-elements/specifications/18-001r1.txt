i.  Abstract 
Improving discoverability of open geo-data and information is vital to increasing the 
use of these data in- and outside the geospatial expert community.  

In this document we start to compare existing metadata standards, e.g., Dublin Core, ISO 
19115/57/19, and INSPIRE, in the geospatial- and open data context. We also describe 
related linked open data initiatives such as RDF, SPARQL, and metadata publication 
initiatives, e.g., schema.org and Atom feeds. GeoDCAT is an initiative with the potential to 
integrate DCAT metadata as they are used in the open data and e-government community 
with EN ISO 19115/57/19 standards and INSPIRE metadata as they are used in the 
Geospatial community. GeoDCAT has - because it is based on RDF- the ability to publish 
metadata directly on the web without open and geospatial data portals. 

To respond to the interest of different communities to preserve geospatial metadata resources 
and to support the uptake of GeoDCAT-AP implementations, best practices from different 
countries were identified and studied. The best practice cases focus on four domains (focus 
areas): metadata input (manually or automatically harvested), metadata publication into an 
integrated geo/open data portal, publication of metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD), and 
information mapping (ISO 19115, INSPIRE, DCAT, etc.). 

GeoDCAT-AP is a mature solution for mapping metadata from the open data and geospatial 
domain. GeoDCAT helps to integrate and to publish metadata in data portals and directly on 
the world wide web. To conclude a GeoDCAT alignment exercise has been done with ISO 
19115/19 and INSPIRE to improve the open data and geospatial metadata alignment in the 
future.

iii. Preface 
Improving the discoverability of (open) geo-information is one of the most important 
approaches to increasing the use of geospatial data in- and outside the geospatial expert 
community. Nowadays metadata are often published on open data portals and geoportals. 
Both type of portals are using different standards to describe metadata. 

Integrating data portals and publishing metadata on the web in a linked open data format is a 
first step in making data more discoverable. Several communities that develop and/or use 
geospatial data along with other information have expressed their interest in DCAT based 
solutions for geospatial datasets. These communities want to preserve their methods and 
formats for managing and publishing metadata, while at the same being able to make them 
discoverable in other environments.

This Discussion Paper was initiated with the help of a number of underlying initiatives such 
as the EU Open Transport Net project and the activities on DCAT under the EU ISA² 
programme1. 

The EU-funded “Open Transport Networks” project (OTN)2 (2014-2017) tried to find 
solutions to integrate open transport and mobility data coming from open data portals and 
(INSPIRE) geo-portals without losing information. OGC and W3C, associated partners in 
OTN, were both aware of the lack of integration of metadata standards between the open data 
'universe' and the geo 'universe.' 

The EU-funded H2020 project “Policy Development based on Advanced Geospatial Data 
Analytics and Visualisation” project (PoliVisu)3, (2017-2020) changes the way urban policy 
making is created by supporting cities (with limited resources) in making effective, informed, 
data-driven decisions. Metadata integration of geospatial and non-geospatial resources is one 
of the primary concerns of the project. DCAT metadata integration including “SensorDCAT” 
should be one of the desired achievements. 

The ISA² programme supports the development of digital solutions that enable public 
administrations, businesses and citizens in Europe to benefit from interoperability across 
borders and sectors through public services4. One of the ISA initiatives is the DCAT 
Application Profile (DCAT-AP) for data portals in Europe5. Specific profiles for the 
geospatial and statistical communities have been developed as well. 

Information Flanders and KU Leuven, with the support of OGC, took the initiative to 
organize an ad hoc meeting at the OGC Dublin TC in June 2016 to discuss the issue based on 
interest shown from the OGC members during the OGC TC in Sydney (December 2015). The 
meeting in Dublin attracted more than 50 experts. It was decided to organize a ‘DCAT 
Geospatial’ subgroup under the OGC Metadata DWG. During the Taichung TC in December 
2016, the subgroup decided to collect examples of GeoDCAT-AP implementations and write 
a Discussion Paper as a first outcome.

1. Introduction 

Building a metadata catalogue requires answers to a series of questions: 

●     Which metadata standards are available? 

●     Which metadata standards are suitable for my needs? 

●     Which metadata standard should I use? 

●     How can I present metadata to my users (professionals, occasional users)? 

●     How can I exchange metadata between different catalogues (formats)? 

The answers to these questions will be different for an e-government or a GIS department, 
even when working with the same datasets. 

From a data provider perspective (typically a government agency), it looks obvious to make a 
distinction between dataset types: geographical data, open data, statistical data, sensor data, 
etc. This difference sometimes depends on the purpose of the data, but also on the software 
used and the availability of appropriate standards. The difference made between open 
datasets and geospatial datasets, despite the possible overlap, is a typical example of an 
organization and software-based approach. In reality it is quite difficult to overcome this kind 
of problem because of the strong link between thematic-oriented organizational thinking, 
available software and standards.  

Metadata is often described as “data about data .” ISO speaks about information about a 
resource. “Resource” is a purposely general term aimed at emphasizing the generality of the 
ISO metadata standards (and models). A resource can be a service, a collection site, software, 
a repository, or many other things. The NISO based Wikipedia definition “Metadata is data 
[information] that provides information about other data”6 describes distinct metadata 
types: descriptive metadata, structural metadata and administrative metadata7. The difference 
between these metadata types is important as they can make discussing metadata more 
complicated than needed when people have different definitions of metadata in mind. 

Metadata for spatial data and spatial services are nowadays mostly created according to some 
standard. However, descriptions concerning titles, abstracts, publication dates, formats, and 
publishers, etc. are the same across all standards. It may be even stated that the basic set of 
metadata items is the same for geographical data/services as for any human product known in 
daily life, as depicted in Figure 1.

The three NISO based distinct types of metadata descriptive metadata, structural metadata, 
and administrative metadata9 are defined as follow: 

• Descriptive metadata describe a resource for purposes such as discovery and 
identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords. 

• Structural metadata is metadata about containers of data and indicate how 
compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form 
chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of 
digital materials. 

• Administrative metadata provide information to help manage a resource, such as 
when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can 
access it. 

In practice, metadata are not only relevant for describing data, but also for other resources 
that allow access to those data (e.g., web services) or resources that allow data processing 
(e.g., software tools). 

                                                
9 In the context of INSPIRE and SDI implementation, distinction is made between discovery metadata (used to 
search and find data/service resources), evaluation metadata (to evaluate whether the data/services are ‘fit-for-
purpose’) and usage metadata (for understanding the data/services correctly when using them).

In this Discussion Paper, we are focusing on descriptive metadata used for resource 
discovery and identification. 

 

The NISO, Wikipedia based typology focuses on the different types of metadata that exist but 
misses a link with metadata use cases. Four use cases are of particular importance: 
discovering metadata, accessing metadata, metadata usage and evaluation. 

• Discovering data: The automatic detection of devices and services offered by these 
devices on a computer network10;  

• Accessing data: The steps, processes, tools and authorizations needed to use data; 

• Using data: The terms of use and licensing, the appropriateness of the dataset;  

• Evaluating data: Evaluating the data quality and usefulness to the purposes described 
in the metadata. 

The figure below gives an overview of some tools and formats that people are using in 
different communities (Geo, Open-data & E-GOV, Developers, and Archiving) to handle 
descriptive metadata. The figure below is a typical result of a sectoral organization-oriented 
approach.

Figure 3: Overview scheme (metadata elements) 

What strategies can be used to overcome the current sectoral oriented situation? 

Theoretically, there are several options. The list below describes a number of single approach 
solutions. 

1. Integrating software solutions that make use of the different standards, so that 
different types of metadata can be published in one single portal; 

2. Defining one “new” comprehensive metadata standard and build an integrated portal 
to publish metadata using this new standard; 

3. Publish the metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD) so that the data is easily 
discoverable on the web (e.g., Via Search Engine Optimization techniques); 

4. The application of mappings to translate metadata from one standard to another so 
that the metadata can be (re-)used in existing software solutions. 

Integrating software solutions (1) and defining new comprehensive standards (2) can be 
considered as long-term solutions. Direct publishing as linked open data (3) and making use 
of mapping techniques (4) are valuable solutions that can be used in the short term. 
Publishing metadata as linked open data requires metadata mapping and using ontologies and 
vocabularies.

Sharing of geospatial metadata via data mapping techniques appears to be the most 
achievable approach to meeting the goal of metadata integration. From a geospatial 
perspective, mappings from ISO 19115 (worldwide standard for geospatial metadata) to RDF 
using general-purpose vocabularies makes sense. The added value of RDF based vocabularies 
lies in its ability to publish metadata directly on the web by using e.g., JSON-LD and to 
exchange information between data portals supporting DCAT based RDF documents. 

GeoDCAT-AP defines mappings from ISO 19115 to DCAT-AP and other general-purpose 
RDF vocabularies that can be used to produce Linked Open Data (LOD). In an EU context, 
GeoDCAT-AP can also be used to map INSPIRE metadata. GeoDCAT-AP is well described 
and already implemented in Geodata portals today. This makes GeoDCAT-AP an interesting 
best practice candidate. Another interesting aspect is the fact that GeoDCAT-AP doesn't 
stand on its own. First of all, it is built on the well-known DCAT W3C recommendation 
(which is the synonym of a standard in W3C terminology)11. On the other hand, there are also 
similar initiatives in the statistical domain such as StatDCAT-AP. Other DCAT based similar 
initiatives can be added in the future. 

DCAT together with GeoDCAT and StatDCAT are using a multidomain approach 
covering Geo, Open-data, Statistical and potentially metadata from other communities. 
This document will describe best practices to combine metadata on the input side by 
using harvesting and/or manual input. The Discussion Paper will also look for 
standards that can be used to make the combined metadata more discoverable via data 
portals and search engines.  

To improve the discoverability of geo-information, GeoDCAT-AP provide an extension on 
the DCAT-Application profile. GeoDCAT-AP makes it possible to publish INSPIRE12 
metadata as RDF. The underlying standard is DCAT, which became a W3C 
recommendation1314 in January 2014. 

 

DCAT is an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues 
published on the Web. This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use. 

                                                
11 At the time of writing (March 2018), a new version of DCAT is under preparation (version 1.1)  by the W3C 
Data Exchange Working Group (DXWG) - https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/charter. 

12 The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a European Union spatial data infrastructure for the purposes of EU 
environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. This European 
Spatial Data Infrastructure will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector 
organisations, facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe and assist in policy-making across 
boundaries. - http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/  

13 W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) - W3C Recommendation 16 January 2014 - 
https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/  

14 The World Wide Web Consortium, W3C, publishes documents that define Web technologies. These 
documents follow a formal, open process designed to promote consensus, fairness, public accountability, and 
quality. At the end of this process, W3C publishes Royalty Free Web standards as Recommendations. Like 
OGC, W3C has submitter status with ISO, meaning its standards are of equal weight.

By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogues, publishers increase discoverability 
and enable applications to easily consume metadata from multiple catalogues. It further 
allows decentralized publishing of catalogues and facilitates federated dataset search across 
sites. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file to facilitate digital 
preservation. 

DCAT-AP15 (Application Profile) is the de-facto EU standard metadata interchange format. 
Most of the EU (open) data portals are using DCAT-AP. DCAT-AP does not support 
necessary metadata elements needed for geospatial datasets. The EU Programme 
“Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations” (ISA) developed DCAT-AP 
as a generic core set of metadata that can be extended to more specific uses. 

 

Figure 4: DCAT overview (relation between DCAT initiatives). 

GeoDCAT-AP extends DCAT-AP to enable descriptions of geospatial datasets. GeoDCAT-
AP translates most of the ISO 1911516 elements necessary for INSPIRE. GeoDCAT-AP does 
NOT replace the actual geospatial metadata standards but allows the exchange of the most 
relevant metadata elements between different domains. 

DCAT-AP can also be extended to other domains. Other extensions of DCAT-AP also exist. 
StatDCAT-AP17 is another extension on DCAT-AP for statistical use. Figure 2 provides an 
overview of the different profiles and how they build upon DCAT.

16 ISO 19115 Geographic information - ISO 19115-1:2014 defines the schema required for describing 
geographic information and services by means of metadata. It provides information about the identification, the 
extent, the quality, the spatial and temporal aspects, the content, the spatial reference, the portrayal, distribution, 
and other properties of digital geographic data and services. 

17 StatDCAT-AP aims at providing a commonly-agreed dissemination vocabulary for the documentation of 
statistical data.StatDCAT-AP defines a certain number of additions to the DCAT-AP model that can be used to 
describe datasets in any format, for example, those published in the Statistical Data and metadata eXchange

2. Overview of relevant metadata standards and related initiatives 

2.1 Open metadata standards 

2.1.1 Dublin core 
The Dublin Core Schema is a small set of terms that can be used to describe documents, web 
resources (video, images, web pages, etc.), physical resources such as books or CDs, and 
objects like artworks. Dublin Core Metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple 
resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different metadata standards, to 
providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in Linked Data Cloud and Semantic 
Web implementations. 

The Dublin Core standard has almost no strict regulations. Each Dublin Core element is 
optional and may be repeated. There is also no prescribed order for presenting or using the 
elements18. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms provides an 
abbreviated reference version of the fifteen element descriptions that have been formally 
endorsed in the ISO Standard 15836:200919. We also may identify 18 metadata terms, 55 
metadata terms respectively, designated as qualified Dublin Core, full Dublin Core 
respectively.  

2.1.2 DCAT 
DCAT is an RDF20 vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues 
published on the Web. By using DCAT to describe datasets in data catalogues, publishers 
increase discoverability and enable applications to consume metadata from multiple 
catalogues. It further enables decentralized publishing of catalogues and facilitates federated 
dataset search across sites. Aggregated DCAT metadata can serve as a manifest file to 
facilitate digital preservation. DCAT makes extensive use of terms from other vocabularies, 
in particular, Dublin Core. 

DCAT uses a layered concept: Catalog, consisting of one or more datasets and one or more 
distributions for each dataset. 

                                                
(SDMX) format, a standard for the exchange of statistical data. The StatDCAT-AP specification is available at: 
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/stat_dcat_application_profile/

19 https://www.iso.org/standard/52142.html 

20 RDF Schema (Resource Description Framework Schema, variously abbreviated as RDFS, RDF(S), RDF-S, 
or RDF/S) is a set of classes with certain properties using the RDF extensible knowledge representation data 
model, providing basic elements for the description of ontologies, otherwise called RDF vocabularies, intended 
to structure RDF resources. See for more details on RDF section 2.2.2

Figure 5: DCAT data-structure 

A dataset in DCAT is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, 
and available for access or download in one or more formats." A dataset does not have to be 
available as a downloadable file. For example, a dataset that is available via an API can be 
defined as an instance of dcat:Dataset and the API can be defined as an instance of 
dcat:Distribution. DCAT itself does not define properties specific to API descriptions. These 
are considered out of scope for this version of the vocabulary. Nevertheless, this can be 
defined as a profile of the DCAT vocabulary. 

Although DCAT (1.0) was only released in January 2014, a revised version (1.1) is currently 
being prepared by the W3C Data Exchange Working Group (DXWG)21. The revision is a 
response to a new set of Use Cases and Requirements submitted on the basis of experience 
gained with the DCAT vocabulary from the time of the original version, and new applications 
originally not considered. The new version may deprecate, but will not delete existing terms. 
The work of the DXWG also looks into the development of guidance for the publication of 
application profiles of vocabularies as well as in the principle of content negotiation by 
application profile. It is expected that DCAT 1.1 and the work of the DXWG in general will 
have an impact on the derived profiles such as DCAT-AP and GeoDCAT-AP.

2.1.3 DCAT-AP 
The DCAT Application Profile (DCAT-AP) 
for data portals in Europe is a specification 
based on DCAT for describing public sector 
datasets in Europe. It is used to enable cross-
data portal search for data sets and improve 
public sector data search across borders and 
sectors. 

The DCAT-AP consists of a set of metadata 
elements, policies and guidelines defined for a 
particular application. An application profile is 
not complete without documentation that 
defines the used policies and best practices 
appropriate to the application. 

DCAT-AP is very common in many European 
data portals, including the EU data portal. 
DCAT-AP suggests the use of specific 
categorizations and describes which fields are 
mandatory, recommended, or optional. 

A good example of a DCAT-AP profile 
defining the policies is the Belgian DCAT-AP 
profile: http://dcat.be/ where the Federal level, 
the regions and individual cities are using the 
same DCAT-AP profile to describe their 
datasets. 

 

Figure 6: DCAT-AP example EU data portal 

Other European countries like Italy, Netherlands, UK, Germany, Sweden, and Norway have 
also implemented their own DCAT-AP profiles.  

A formal definition of DCAT-AP and related extensions is underway22.  

The DCAT-AP profile is vital to make sure that the data portals can harvest metadata from 
other portals without losing information. 

An application profile typically arranges: 

- Mandatory, Recommended and Optional fields in the dataset and distribution; 
- Controlled input of mandatory fields.

To enhance the harvesting process a thesaurus mapping is available for the EU member state 
languages23. Also, alignments are available between the controlled vocabularies used in ISO 
19115 / INSPIRE metadata and those used in DCAT-AP24. 

2.2 Linked (Open) Data 
In addition to the open data metadata standards, other relevant non-thematic initiatives have a 
strong link with metadata standards and metadata publication. Linked Open Data (LOD) and 
Schema.org are related initiatives to make metadata more discoverable on the web.  

The term Linked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing structured data on the 
Web. These principles have been coined by Tim Berners-Lee in the design issue note Linked 
Data. The principles are: 

1. Use URIs as names for things; 

2. Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names; 

3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information; 

4. Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things. 

The idea behind these principles is, on one hand, to use standards for the representation and 
access to data on the Web. On the other hand, the principles propagate to create hyperlinks 
between data from different sources. These hyperlinks connect all Linked Data into a single 
global data graph, as the hyperlinks on the classic Web connect all HTML documents into a 
single global information space. Thus, Linked Data is to spreadsheets and databases what the 
Web of hypertext documents is to word processor files25. Linked Open Data allows access to 
entire datasets on a metadata level and on the level of the data itself.  

2.2.1 Linked data versus open data 
Linked data is per definition open, in a way that the data is available under an open data 
license. "Linked data" refers to data that is machine-readable, semantic data or in other words 
data that a machine can 'understand'. The "semantic meaning" comes from the links to other 
data that provide context to your data. "Open Data" refers to data that is accessible to anyone 
with a permissive license on reuse.  

The 5 star linked data rating system by Tim Berners-Lee (especially Star 1 and 3) describes 
the relation between open data and linked data26.

★ make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license 

★★ make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table) 

★★★ use non-proprietary formats (e.g., CSV instead of Excel) 

★★★★ use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff 

★★★★★ link your data to other data to provide context 

Figure 7: Tim Berners Lee, 5 star open data deployment scheme27 

2.2.2 RDF, SPARQL and OWL Standards to create linked open data 
RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a W3C recommendation and standard model for 
data interchange on the Web. The purpose of RDF is to provide a structure for describing 
identified “things.” To make meaningful descriptions of "things," an open structure called 
triples is used. A triple is made up of a resource (the thing that you want to describe), a 
property (explain the relation between things), and the class (the bucket used to describe 
things). RDF uses URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to represent things. RDF makes it 
possible to describe almost every object e.g., public transport stops, books, postal addresses, 
etc. in a structured way.  

Using this simple model, RDF allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, 
exposed, and shared across different applications. This linking structure forms a directed,

labelled graph, where the edges represent named links between two resources, represented by 
graph nodes. This graph view is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used 
in easy-to-understand visual explanations28. 

As mentioned before, DCAT is an example of an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate 
interoperability between data catalogues with metadata on resources, published on the Web. 

SPARQL is also a W3C recommendation and is used to query data stored in RDF. SPARQL 
can be used to express queries across diverse data sources, whether the data is stored natively 
as RDF or viewed as RDF via middleware.29 OGC has developed GeoSPARQL which 
supports representing and querying geospatial data on the Semantic Web. GeoSPARQL 
defines a vocabulary for representing geospatial data in RDF, and it defines an extension to 
the SPARQL query language for processing geospatial data. In addition, GeoSPARQL is 
designed to accommodate systems based on qualitative spatial reasoning and quantitative 
spatial computations. 

The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed to 
represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between 
things. OWL is a computational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in 
OWL can be exploited by computer programs, e.g., to verify the consistency of that 
knowledge or to make implicit knowledge explicit. OWL documents, known as ontologies, 
can be published in the World Wide Web (WWW) and may refer to or be referred from other 
OWL ontologies. OWL is part of the W3C’s Semantic Web technology stack, which also 
includes RDF and SPARQL. 

To provide context to your objects, you can make use of your own or existing OWL 
vocabularies. You can connect your object to other objects using existing ontologies. The 
more popular the used vocabularies30 are, the more your data objects become Linked Open 
Data (LOD).  

2.2.3 SHACL - Shapes Constraint Language 
SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is a language for describing and constraining the 
contents of RDF graphs. SHACL groups these descriptions and constraints into "shapes," 
which specify conditions that apply at a given RDF node. Shapes provide a high-level 
vocabulary to identify predicates and their associated cardinalities, data types and other 
constraints. Additional constraints can be associated with shapes using SPARQL and similar 
extension languages. These extension languages can also be used to define new high-level 
vocabulary terms. SHACL shapes can be used to communicate information about data 
structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user 
interfaces31. SHACL became a W3C Recommendation in July 2017.

2.2.4 DQV - Data Quality Vocabulary meta-information 
The Data Quality Vocabulary32 is a recommendation from the W3C Data on the Web Best 
Practice Working Group. The Data Quality Vocabulary defines concepts such as measures 
and metrics to assess the quality for each quality dimension. The Web Best Practice Working 
Group states that: “Data quality affect the suitability of data for specific applications, 
including applications very different from the purpose for which the data was originally 
generated. Documenting data quality significantly eases the process of dataset selection, 
increasing the chances of reuse. Independently from domain-specific peculiarities, the quality 
of data should be documented and known quality issues should be explicitly stated in 
metadata.”33 

The goal of DQV is to provide a standard useful for humans and software agents to assess the 
quality and suitability of a dataset for their application. The Data Quality Vocabulary 
(DQV)34is foreseen as an extension to the DCAT vocabulary [vocab-dcat]35 to cover the 
quality of the data, how frequently it is updated, whether it accepts user corrections, 
persistence commitments, etc. When used by publishers, this vocabulary will foster trust in 
the data amongst developers. 

The DQV vocabulary is based on DCAT [vocab-dcat] that it extends with a number of 
additional properties and classes suitable for expressing the quality of a dataset36. 

The quality of a given dataset or distribution is assessed via a number of observed properties. 
For instance, one may consider a dataset to be of high quality because it conforms to a 
specific standard while for other use-cases the quality of the data will depend on its level of 
interlinking with other datasets. To express these properties an instance of a dcat:Dataset37 or 
dcat:Distribution38 can be related to five different types of quality information represented by 
the following classes: 

● dqv:QualityAnnotation39 represents feedback and quality certificates given about the 
dataset or its distribution; 

● dcterms:Standard40 represents a standard the dataset or its distribution conforms to;

● dqv:QualityPolicy41 represents a policy or agreement that is chiefly governed by data 
quality concerns; 

● dqv:QualityMeasurement42 represents a metric value providing quantitative or 
qualitative information about the dataset or distribution; and 

● prov:Entity43 represents an entity involved in the provenance of the dataset or 
distribution. 

2.3 Metadata publication 

2.3.1 Schema.org 
Schema.org describes itself as “a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, 
maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email 
messages, and beyond.” 

Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, 
Microdata, and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities 
and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model.”44 

Schema.org makes your data more discoverable on the web by adding more contextual 
information interpretable by search engines like google, bing, yahoo, and yandex. The search 
results can also be displayed in a better way by using new visualizations like Rich Snippets 
and Rich cards. This can lead to a better visualization of your dataset metadata. 

To publish your DCAT metadata on the web using schema.org a mapping is needed. The 
W3C, OGC supported ‘Spatial Data on the Web’ working group has a draft document 
describing the mapping between ISO 19115, DCAT and Schema.org45. The JRC also 
published a draft report describing the mapping from DCAT-AP to Schema.org46.

Figure 8: Metadata presentation by using schema.org as a basis for Rich Snippets and 
Rich cards 

The power of schema.org lies in its vocabularies developed by an open community process. 
The schema.org core plus extension vocabularies contain already specific properties for 
describing data sets, data feeds, data catalogues and digital documents.  

2.3.2 Atom feeds 
Atom refers to a pair of related web standards. The Atom Syndication Format is an XML 
format used for web feeds, and the Atom Publishing Protocol is a HTTP-based protocol used 
for web feeds. Atom is used to create web feeds that allow software programs to check for 
updates published on a website. The feeds can be downloaded by programs that use it, e.g., 
Websites that syndicate software from the feed or reader programs that allow internet users to 
subscribe to feeds.  

Feeds are composed of items, known as "entries," each with an extensible set of attached 
metadata. For example, each entry has a title. Atom was developed as an alternative to RSS.  



OGC 18-001r1 

30 

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Atom was a proposed standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)47 as RFC 
428748 in December 2005, and the Atom Publishing Protocol was published as RFC 502349 in 
October 2007. 

An Atom feed typically exists of a feed that acts as a container for metadata associated with 
the feed. An Atom entry represents an individual entry, acting as a container for metadata and 
data associated with the entry. The atom content element contains or links to the content of 
the entry and is also language-sensitive.  

Compared to DCAT and Dublin Core, Atom contains most of the metadata elements. The 
Atom elements match almost one on one to the DCAT and Dublin core terms. Atom also has 
the opportunity to add extensions by using simple- and structured extension elements. 

It is worthwhile noting that in the context of INSPIRE, Atom feeds can be used for providing 
downloads of the data50.

2.4.1.1 ISO 19115:2003 and ISO 19115:2014 - Geographic information metadata 
ISO 19115 is a standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The 
standard is part of the ISO geographic information Suite of Standards (19100 series). ISO 
19115 and its parts define how to describe geographical information and associated services, 
including contents, spatial-temporal purchases, data quality, access, and rights to use. 

The objective of this International Standard is to provide a clear procedure for the description 
of digital geographic datasets and services so that users will be able to determine whether the 
data in a holding will be of use to them and how to access the data. By establishing a 
common set of metadata terminology, definitions, and extension procedures, this standard 
promotes the proper use and effective retrieval of geographic data. 

ISO 19115 was revised in 2013 to accommodate growing use of the internet for metadata 
management, as well as to add many new categories of metadata elements (referred to as 
code lists) and the ability to limit the extent of metadata use temporally or by the user. 

In 2016 ISO/TS 19115-3:2016 was adopted. It defines an integrated XML implementation of 
ISO 19115‑1, ISO 19115‑2, and concepts from ISO/TS 19139.

50 The other way is through the setup of WFS. 

51 Most of the standards of the ISO 19100 series were also adopted as CEN standards, they are usually indicated 
with EN and then the ISO name.

2.4.1.2 ISO 19119:2005 and ISO 19119:2016 - Geographic information services 
ISO 19119:2005 identifies and defines the architecture patterns for service interfaces used for 
geographic information, defines its relationship to the Open Systems Environment model, 
presents a geographic services taxonomy and a list of example geographic services placed in 
the services taxonomy.  

It also prescribes how to create a platform-neutral service specification, how to derive 
conformant platform-specific service specifications, and provides guidelines for the selection 
and specification of geographic services from both platform-neutral and platform-specific 
perspectives52. 

ISO 19119:2005 was revised and resulted in ISO 19119:2016. The 2016 version defines 
requirements for how platform neutral and platform-specific specification of services shall be 
created, in order to allow for one service to be specified independently of one or more 
underlying distributed computing platforms. Is also defines requirements for a further 
mapping from platform neutral to   service specifications, in order to enable conformant and 
interoperable service implementations53. The service metadata model and requirements have 
been moved to ISO 19115-1: 2014 (clause 6.5.14). So this new version only speaks in very 
general terms about the need for service metadata. 

The INSPIRE Metadata specifications or Implementing Rules and the ‘INSPIRE Metadata 
Technical Guidelines’ are based on EN ISO 19115 and EN  ISO 19119:2005 for describing 
metadata for data sets, data sets series and services54. 

2.4.1.3 ISO 19110:2005 and 2016 Geographic information methodology for feature 
cataloguing. 
ISO 19110:2016 the successor of the 2005 version defines the methodology for cataloguing 
feature types. This document specifies how feature types can be organized into a feature 
catalogue and presented to the users of a set of geographic data. This document is applicable 
to creating catalogues of feature types in previously uncatalogued domains and to revise 
existing feature catalogues to comply with standard practice. This document applies to the 
cataloguing of feature types that are represented in digital form. Its principles can be 
extended to the cataloguing of other forms of geographic data55.  

2.4.1.4 ISO/TS 19139:2007 Geographic information - Metadata - XML Schema 
Implementation 
Defines Geographic MetaData XML (gmd) encoding, an XML Schema implementation 
derived from ISO 1911556. Geographic metadata is represented in ISO 19115 as a set of UML 
packages containing one or more UML classes. ISO 19115 provides a universal, encoding-
independent view of geographic information metadata. ISO/TS 19139 provides a universal

implementation of ISO 19115 through an XML schema encoding that conforms to the rules 
described in ISO 19118 (Encoding). 

ISO/TS 19139 is currently under review and will be replaced by ISO/NP TS 19139-1. Also 
here, the specific metadata XML encoding will be removed and is now part of ISO/TS 
19115-3: 2016 which defines an integrated XML implementation of ISO 19115-1 and ISO 
19115-2 (for gridded data). 

2.4.1.5 ISO 19150 Rules for developing ontologies in the Web Ontology Language 
(OWL) 
ISO/TS 19150-1:2012 defines the framework for semantic interoperability of geographic 
information. This framework defines a high-level model of the components required to 
handle semantics in the ISO geographic information standards with the use of ontologies57. 

ISO 19150-2:2015 defines rules and guidelines for the development of ontologies to support 
better the interoperability of geographic information over the Semantic Web. The Web 
Ontology Language (OWL) is the language adopted for ontologies. 

It defines the conversion of the UML static view modeling elements used in the ISO 
geographic information standards into OWL. It further defines conversion rules for 
describing application schemas based on the General Feature Model defined in ISO 19109 
into OWL. 

It does not define semantics operators, rules for service ontologies, and does not develop any 
ontology58. 

2.4.2 INSPIRE specification 
The INSPIRE Directive aims to create a European Union spatial data infrastructure for the 
purposes of EU environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact 
on the environment. This European Spatial Data Infrastructure will enable the sharing of 
environmental spatial information among public sector organizations, facilitate public access 
to spatial information across Europe and assist in policy-making across boundaries. 

The INSPIRE Directive also emphasizes priorities for the development of the European 
spatial data infrastructure: “the infrastructures for spatial information in the Member States 
should be designed to ensure that […] it is easy to discover available spatial data, to 
evaluate their suitability for the purpose and to know the conditions applicable to their use.” 

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information established and operated by 
the Member States of the European Union. The Directive addresses 34 spatial data themes 
needed for environmental applications.

The Directive came into force on 15 May 2007 and is implemented in various stages59, with 
full implementation required by 202160. 

To make the thematic information sources coming from the 28 EU member states 
interoperable on the metadata level, INSPIRE established metadata implementing rules (= 
legislation) and metadata technical guidelines.  

The 'INSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules’61 is a EU Regulation62 which establishes the 
obligations under which public sector bodies in the EU should publish descriptive metadata 
on geographic data sets (series) and services. It describes a set of twenty-one metadata 
elements to be used to describe geographic datasets, dataset series and services. Such set of 
INSPIRE metadata elements was extended by five in 2010 and one more in 201363. In order 
to further harmonize the implementation of these obligations, the (non-binding) 'INSPIRE 
Metadata Technical Guidelines'64 were defined. These technical guidelines show how the 
metadata elements in the Regulation match metadata elements in ISO 19115: 2003 and ISO 
19119: 2007. The specification also contains examples how metadata records can be 
transformed into XML. Although the Technical Guidelines are not binding, it is strongly 
advised to follow them as otherwise it is very difficult to demonstrate that the metadata 
provided in a different model / format is in accordance with the INSPIRE Metadata 
Implementing Rules (which themselves are binding)65. 

These technical Guidelines prescribe the use of ISO19115:2003. However, a metadata record 
that complies with the ISO19115: 2003 core elements is not fully compliant with the 
INSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules and its derived Technical Guidelines. There are 
some additional metadata elements that INSPIRE requires on top of the ISO19115: 2003 core 
profile, e.g., the (degree of) ‘conformity’ of spatial datasets with the INSPIRE Data 
specifications. 

2.5 Conclusion and overview 
Closing the gap between open data standards and geospatial standards isn’t an easy process 
because of the organic growth of standards over the past decades. Because of a lack of 
knowledge of each other’ standards, there is a lot of redundancy between metadata 
information, and there is a need for data mapping to allow re-using metadata and to make

data and other resources discoverable over the web, independently of the portal that hosts the 
metadata of the resource.  

The figure below gives an overview of the most important standards and initiatives in the 
Geospatial and Open-data fields. The standards section (metadata specifications) below, 
shows that these initiatives are clearly divided between specific geospatial oriented metadata 
standards (ISO 19115 & 19) and non-geospatial standards as Dublin Core. The ISO 19115 
based EU oriented INSPIRE data specifications are also part of the family of Geospatial 
metadata standards.  

The machine to machine communication layer contains standards and initiatives to exchange 
information between data portals or business software with a data catalogue included. The 
most common formats are XML and RDF including JSON-LD. Where ISO 19139 and DCAT 
are respectively geospatial and open-data oriented formats, the very general RDF triples and 
more particular GeoDCAT-AP format are multisectoral. (Meta)data publication as linked 
open data and GeoDCAT-AP can integrate open non-geospatial metadata and geospatial 
metadata in a way that it can be used for publication on the web. Both initiatives (GeoDCAT-
AP and more general the publication of RDF triples) are intermediary formats/technologies. 

 

 

Figure 9: Metadata standards Quadrant overview 

The web publication of geospatial and open datasets is nowadays done by using geodata 
portals or open data portals. The latter have in some cases also a basic geo-visualization 
function often displaying a bounding box. Another technique is using information feeds like 
Atom. The most commonly used feeds don’t have a geospatial element included. Schema.org

is an interesting format to publish all the metadata directly on the web. Schema.org can also 
contain some basic geospatial data. The power of Schema.org lies in the fact that data can be 
found directly using a search engine.  

GeoDCAT-AP as an extension on DCAT-AP is a very powerful intermediary format to 
translate ISO 19100 or Inspire stored metadata into an RDF compatible format that can be 
used to publish metadata on (geo)data portals and on the web. GeoDCAT-AP as an 
intermediary format today can exchange open data and geospatial data in a well-defined 
format. 

In the next chapter, we will elaborate some best practices examples of the use of GeoDCAT-
AP. We will look at how GeoDCAT-AP handles the information mapping, the publication 
and exchange between systems and publication on the web using LOD.  

3. GeoDCAT-AP best practices implementations 

3.1 Intro 
The GeoDCAT-AP best practices describe successful GeoDCAT-AP initiatives. These 
initiatives could be a full implementation in production, a pre-production implementation 
with test results or just a test or proof of concept. Pure theoretical cases without any 
implementation are excluded.  

We are focusing on two elements divided into four focus areas: 

● Integrated metadata management: Management of open data- and Geo metadata 
via one interface (harvesting interface and/or manual input interface); 

● Integrated publication: Publication of open data- and geo metadata via one interface 
(data portal or publication on the web). 

Four focus areas are of particular interest. Each of the pilots covers at least one of the focus 
areas as a primary goal. 

● Metadata input (manually or automatically harvested); 

● Metadata publication into an integrated geo/open data portal; 

● Publication of metadata as Linked Open Data (LOD); 

● Information mapping (ISO 19115, INSPIRE, DCAT, etc.). 

In this chapter, you will find a brief best practice story describing the goals and final results 
in a nontechnical way. The primary focus lies on the role GeoDCAT-AP has played in the 
implementation process. More information for each of the best practices is available in the 
annexes.  

In the conclusion section we compare each of the best practices in a form of summarizing 
table. This table allows us to elaborate if and how GeoDCAT-AP implementations cover the 
focus areas.

3.2 ESA FedEO/OBEOS - GeoDCAT-AP implementation 
The ESA OBEOS (Ontology Based Earth Observation Search) project aimed to extend the 
operational ESA FedEO (Federated Earth Observation) Gateway with Linked Data interfaces 
compliant with W3C LDP 1.066 and W3C DCAT and GeoDCAT-AP interfaces to facilitate 
discovery of Earth Observation Collection Metadata. Through the additional RESTful FedEO 
API, all EO collection metadata accessible through FedEO become immediately accessible as 
Linked Data. For product metadata discovery, a similar approach was implemented. The 
original W3C DCAT encoding evolved recently to a GeoDCAT-AP encoding. 

The objectives of the OBEOS demonstrator included: 

● Publication of EO metadata for collections and products using the Linked Data 
paradigm; 

● Provision of a fully standards-based implementation and use commonly accepted 
vocabularies; 

● Link to recognized authorities providing Linked Data URI for satellites, instruments, 
science keywords, coordinate reference systems etc.; 

● Investigation enrichment of EO collection metadata landing pages using schema.org 
annotations (JSON-LD); 

● Provision of selected components of the demonstrator as open-source; and 

● Being easily integrated in the operational FedEO Clearinghouse at ESA. 

 

The OBEOS Project showed the feasibility of Linked Data encoding (JSON-LD) of EO 
collection metadata  using W3C DCAT and the evolution towards GeoDCAT-AP.  
GeoDCAT-AP allowed for the main EO Collection properties to be mapped. 

Further work and possibly changes are needed to GeoDCAT-AP 1.0.1 and/or OGC 14-055r2 
to allow specifications to be based on both simultaneously and use a JSON-LD @context 
document for interpretation of JSON as JSON-LD (RDF)67.  

3.3 OGC Testbed 12 
OGC Testbed-12 developed a crosswalk to evaluate interoperability between different 
metadata specifications. The metadata specifications included the OGC I15 (ISO19115 
Metadata) Extension Package of the CSW ebRIM Profile 1.0, NSG Metadata Foundation 
(NMF), DGIWG Metadata Foundation (DMF), DoD Discovery Metadata Specification 
(DDMS) and the W3C Data Catalog (DCAT) specification. 

The OGC Testbed-12 metadata crosswalk was developed within a work package focusing on 
Catalogue and SPARQL services. The goal of the Testbed-12 work was to:

● Improve understanding of the potential for semantic enablement of OGC catalogue 
services; 

● Improve interoperability between OGC catalogue standards and open search standards 
currently adopted by several general search engines; 

● Increase awareness of registry capabilities such as change control management, which 
are supported by specific profiles of OGC catalogue standards. 

The testbed found that DCAT on its own has a limited geospatial vocabulary. However, when 
integrated with GeoSPARQL to create GeoDCAT-AP it provides a geospatial vocabulary 
capable of supporting catalogue federation. The testbed recommended that the OGC should 
standardize the GeoDCAT-AP specification. The testbed also found that the metadata 
returned by the different catalogues ranged from ISO 19139 XML, NMIS, DDMS, ebRIM 
ExtrisicObjects etc. The testbed recommended that catalogue services should be enabled to 
offer a GeoSPARQL service endpoint that publishes metadata in GeoDCAT-AP and can 
receive federated SPARQL queries from other GeoSPARQL services. 

3.4 OTN Open Transport Net - GeoDCAT-AP implementation 
Open geospatial data is the focus of the OTN (Open Transport Networks) EU funded project. 
OTN aims to integrate (metadata) of INSPIRE compatible transport related geospatial 
datasets with open transport related datasets. To integrate and display open and geospatial 
(meta)data OTN has built a so-called OTN hub that allows cities to manage and display their 
open and geospatial transport related datasets in one single catalogue. 

The OTN Hub has several non-trivial requirements. The Hub is dealing with a mix of spatial 
and non-spatial data, and these data need to be discoverable through its metadata. 

The metadata must be easily searchable using one single and easy to use interface. The most 
important element to achieve this goal is the metadata harmonization of spatial and non-
spatial datasets and services. These are essential to enable a uniform way of querying 
metadata. GeoDCAT-AP was an obvious choice due to the combination of geospatial and 
open data practices. 

The combined solution used in OTN combines the open data portal CKAN and Micka. 
CKAN is used as the entry point for new datasets (spatial or non-spatial), either as a file 
upload or as a harvest from other data portals. Webhooks, a CKAN extension scans for 
changes and notifies an intermediate CKAN2CSW module, which was created for the scope 
of OTN. This module requests the full details of any changed dataset and translates these into 
CSW transactions that are pushed to Micka. In this way, Micka is kept synchronized with 
CKAN. Micka serves as metadata catalogue and is the single point of entry for the portal. 
GeoDCAT-AP can be generated on the fly for the various queries. Following existing 
standards is vital for interoperability. Both the open data and the geospatial world have stable 
standards, and GeoDCAT-AP is the first attempt in combining the two. Combining several 
software packages seems to be the best approach until GeoDCAT-AP gets better adoption in 
metadata management tools. 

3.5 Data Bio metadata visualization project 
“Traditional” ways of metadata visualization represent a burden for a user who would like to 
focus on his/her work, however, needs to deal with metadata in a special application. The 
Data Bio project approach aims to a more user-friendly work with metadata in a commonly 



OGC 18-001r1 

38 

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

used application, Google Earth (in the KML format). The idea behind this metadata approach 
is that “The best/most user-friendly metadata platform is the one not shown to a user.”  

The main goals are: 

● Define transformations from GeoDCAT into the KML; 

● Develop mechanisms for user-friendly visualizations of (Sentinel-1, Deimos and 
Cryosat-2) dataset series in the Google Earth application; 

● Make the converter for GeoDCAT to KML publicly accessible for further re-use; and 

● In general, user-friendly visualization of satellite images collections (dataset series). 

The main achievement was the developed converter that transforms GeoDCAT into KML 
format that is publicly available (https://dev.bnhelp.cz/projects/dcatconv/). The result is a 
user-friendly visualization of GeoDCAT metadata from earth observation satellite data 
without the necessity of a metadata platform. 

3.6 Czech National Inspire Geoportal 
The Czech National INSPIRE Geoportal is a single access point for INSPIRE based spatial 
data and make use of GeoDCAT-AP. Beside INSPIRErelated datasets the portal can also 
handle metadata coming from other open- and geo- related datasets. 

The GeoDCAT-AP implementation has several goals:  

● Testing the GeoDCAT-AP implementation on the existing metadata catalogue (CSW 
2.0.2); 

● Online tool for transformation INSPIRE metadata to GeoDCAT-AP; 

● Platform for automatic translation between Czech INSPIRE geoportal and Czech 
Open Data Portal (harvesting INSPIRE metadata as Geo-DCAT-AP feeds); 

● CENIA (Czech Environmental Information Agency) is responsible for portal 
operation; and 

● The portal is intended for INSPIRE support at national level. 

In the future the Czech National Inspire Geoportal will be extended with: 

● Continuous updates according to changes in INSPIRE metadata profiles, services, 
etc.; and 

● Communication with Czech national Open Portal. 

The Czech INSPIRE Geoportal make extensive use of GeoDCAT-AP.  

● The Czech geoportal has included a CSW client with GeoDCAT-AP RDF/XML 
output (available on the top bar at metadata detail panel). 

● A RDF compatible HTML page is available for every dataset. This page offers a 
structured overview of the metadata. 



OGC 18-001r1 

39 

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● On-line tool for data conversion from INSPIRE metadata format to the GeoDCAT-AP 
metadata format. 

● A connection to the Czech Open Data Portal is needed as well. Therefore, the Open 
Data Portal should support GeoDCAT-AP as well. 

3.7 Dutch testbed Geonovum 
The central question of the spatial data on the web test setup was how to use the power of the 
World Wide Web to make geo-information more accessible? This testbed was organized in 
2015-2016. Starting with some relevant research questions, commercial parties began to 
experiment with publishing geodata on the web.  

GeoDCAT-AP was tested as one of the tools/techniques to translate INSPIRE, ISO 19139 
metadata records to a format that can be picked up by the most commonly used search 
engines on the web. 

Finding, accessing and using data disseminated through spatial data infrastructures (SDI) 
based on OGC web services is difficult for non-expert users. The Geonovum research has 
investigated how to improve this while keeping the current spatial data infrastructures intact: 
i.e., “we have been exploring ideas how to realize synergies between the existing spatial data 
infrastructures and the developments on the Web of data.” 

Different techniques have been tested. One of the work items was to transform ISO 19139 
records to GeoDCAT-AP compatible RDF. 

The focus of the testbed can be summarized as a number of test implementations to test and 
improve: 

● The crawlability and linkability, i.e., making each resource available via a persistent 
URI and ensure that all resources can be reached via links from a “landing page” for a 
data set; 

● Classification of the resources using vocabularies supported by the main search 
engines on the Web; 

● Discovery of spatial data by search engines; 

● Representations of data for consumption by humans (HTML), web-developers 
(JSON) and search engine crawlers (HTML with annotations); and 

● Establishing and maintaining links between data. 

To a large extent the Geonovum testbed was successful implementing the intermediate proxy 
layer as an interface between the Dutch SDI and open data portals, search engine crawlers 
and the web developers community. The main results are: 

● The (meta)data resources were made available by the used proxies; 

● The mapping of the data and metadata resources to the schema.org vocabulary (plus 
the GeoDCAT-AP vocabulary for metadata) are achieved with a minimum of lost 
metadata elements; 



OGC 18-001r1 

40 

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● The strategy for assigning URIs to the resources was achieved and tested; 

● The representations (formats), in which each resource are available; 

● New experiences with establishing links across data sets and between data and 
metadata; and 

● New experiences with search engines crawling and indexing the resources. 

There are still some challenges to improve the data findability on the web: 

● Improve existing infrastructure to support dynamic linking between resources 
(features) in the dataset and to avoid incomplete and inconsistent metadata; and 

● Web related challenges to make search engines more open in a way to understand 
how you can deliver your data in the best possible way and the implementation of a 
scheme-based content negotiation besides a media based content negotiation. 

3.8 Information Flanders (IV) implementation 
Information Flanders (Belgium) is integrating their open-data metadata and geo metadata in 
one single end-user portal and one integrated metadata management system. As EU member, 
Belgium and Information Flanders as one of the regional public agencies, must apply the 
INSPIRE metadata profiles. This means that IV is dependent on different metadata standards 
(DCAT-AP) for open data and (Geo DCAT-AP, ISO19115) for Geodata. 

This section describes how Information Flanders integrates Open Data metadata records 
(DCAT-AP) and SDI (the Spatial Data Infrastructure of Flanders) metadata records (Geo 
DCAT-AP, INSPIRE, ISO 19115) using a schema-based approach. 

● DCAT-AP support based on the ISO19139 Scheme; and 

● DCAT-AP support DCAT based on a new scheme. 

The general approach used in both experiments is to start from a GIS metadata management 
system and adapt this system to handle open metadata in a way that is also convenient for 
open data specialists without encumbering the system with extra geo-related fields. The two 
implementation scenarios were tested in the context of a metadata study68. 

The idea behind was to make metadata editing as simple as possible for the data provider. 
The ‘once only’ principle whereby data must be inputted one single time is a critical element 
in this simplification approach. The idea behind both experiments was to use the same 
metadata management system to bridge the gap between geographic- and open data and to 
elaborate methods to reduce costs and to increase efficiency compared to wholly separated 
geo- and open-data metadata systems.

Figure 10: Bridging the gap between metadata standards, systems and portals69   

More specific, two different experiments to store and export metadata based on ISO19139 
Geographic information -- Metadata -- XML schema implementation were carried out to test 
a smooth metadata management. 

● Experiment 1: Support of GeoDCAT-AP metadata based on the existing ISO 19139 
scheme; and 

● Experiment 2: Support of GeoDCAT AP schema based on a new developed 
GeoDCAT-AP based schema plugin.  

The first experiment shows that it is technically feasible to manage both GeoDCAT-AP 
metadata records and metadata records for SDI Flanders using a Geo Metadata management 
solution. The GeoDCAT-AP metadata records can also be made available as Linked Data.  

When using the ISO option metadata schema, it is less easy to reconstruct a pure DCAT 
based graphical user environment for open data metadata.  

To avoid discouraging Open Data users who need an input interface that is adapted to the 
information they need (without GIS specialist related fields), preference was given to 
implement “GeoNetwork Schematic Plugin for DCAT-AP” as described in the second 
experiment. 

The second experiment shows that it is technically feasible to manage both GeoDCAT-AP 
metadata records and metadata records for SDI Flanders using a single metadata management 
solution. The DCAT-AP metadata records can be made available as Linked Data. 

As indicated above, this option offers the advantage of having a high degree of freedom 
regarding the customization of the graphical user environment. Therefore, this option was

preferred. A minor disadvantage is the fact that the metadata database stores different XML 
schemas. This requires some attention when a bulk update of, e.g. address information or 
licenses would occur. But here too, the use of code lists that refer to a set of predefined 
organizations and licensing conditions is the best solution. 

3.9 Outcomes and conclusions 
The cases shows a broad interest in GeoDCAT-AP. Several independent international and 
national organizations and research initiatives have already tested GeoDCAT-AP in several 
domains (metadata input, portal integration, linked open data publication and information 
mapping). Each of the 4 domains are at least once considered as the primary focus area of the 
implemented or tested solution.

3.9.1 Focus & goals 
The Information Flanders and Open Transport Net (OTN) cases both focus on metadata 
input. Where OTN is primary focusing on automatic harvesting data from open- and 
geospatial portals to integrate the metadata in one single searchable catalogue, the

Information Flanders best practice focuses on inputting metadata using DCAT and Geospatial 
metadata using INSPIRE/ISO by implementing tailored input schemes. 

Metadata publication on an integrated geo/open data portal is a focus area of the Czech data 
portal, Information Flanders, Open Transport Net & dataBio project. The Czech best practice 
focuses on the automatic data exchange and transformation between the Czech Inspire 
geoportal and the Czech open data portal by harvesting the INSPIRE metadata as Geo-DCAT 
feed. The OTN best practice integrates INSPIRE/ISO metadata and DCAT metadata into one 
single portal where DCAT contains the basic information about each dataset. The 
Information Flanders best practice also focuses on metadata publication in an open data and 
compatible geospatial format based on GeoDCAT-AP/INSPIRE. The DataBio best practice 
goal is to gather and display metadata without the need for a specific metadata catalogue 
integrating metadata directly into GIS tools.  

The Dutch Geonovum testbed has a strong focus on publishing metadata as linked open 
data (LOD) by transforming ISO 19139 records to GeoDCAT-AP compatible RDF and by 
assigning URI’s and establishing links across datasets and metadata. OTN focusses on 
defining and loading SPARQL endpoints for the OTN (meta)data as a first step towards the 
publication of linked open data. The ESA OBEOS (Ontology Based Earth Observation 
Search) project aimed to extend the operational ESA FedEO Gateway with Linked Data 
interfaces compliant with W3C LDP 1.0 and W3C DCAT and GeoDCAT-AP interfaces to 
facilitate discovery of Earth Observation Collection Metadata. The focus is on the publication 
of EO metadata for collections and products using the Linked Data, more specific to link 
recognized authorities providing Linked Data URI for satellites, instruments, science 
keywords, and coordinate reference systems. 

Information mapping towards GeoDCAT-AP has been primarily tested in the Information 
Flanders best practice case and the Czech best practice. Information Flanders used schemas to 
support GeoDCAT-AP metadata based on ISO19139 and a DCAT-AP schema plugin while 
the Czech case worked with an online tool for data conversion from Inspire metadata format 
to GeoDCAT. The OGC testbed 12 was primarily focusing on aligning OGC catalogue 
services and SPARQL services to improve semantics and adoption by search engines. 

3.9.2 Outcomes 
The primary outcomes on metadata input were the implementation of two schemes to 
handle DCAT based open data metadata and ISO 19115/INSPIRE based metadata in Flanders 
(Information Flanders best practice). Both schemas make it possible to input DCAT and ISO 
19115/INSPIRE metadata in the same portal adapted to the specific DCAT and ISO/INSPIRE 
standards. A significant advantage is that DCAT records can be entered without the extra 
ISO/Inspire requirements. The OTN best practice case shows that it is possible by integrating 
an open data metadata solution and a geospatial metadata solution to build an integrated 
catalogue using automated harvesting mechanisms. Both best practices prove that metadata 
coming from different sources (open data DCAT feeds and Geospatial ISO 19115/INSPIRE 
feeds) and that was manually entered, or automatically harvested, can be used to publish 
metadata in GeoDCAT-AP. 

On the Metadata publication side, the Czech geoportal achieved to build a CSW client that 
produces a GeoDCAT RDF/XML output. The RDFa compatible output has been used to 
create HTML pages containing metadata and/or KML visualization as depicted in Figure 8. 
Search engines index these pages and make them directly available on the web. OTN uses the 
same approach to produce GeoDCAT RDF/XML from existing ISO 19139/INSPIRE 
metadata in the catalogue according to the rules defined by the GeoDCAT-AP specification.

Information Flanders achieved to successfully implement two schemes that make it possible 
to publish DCAT-AP and ISO 19119/INSPIRE metadata in a single publication environment. 
The Dutch SDI testbed achieved to map and publish data and metadata resources to the 
schema.org vocabulary and the GeoDCAT-AP vocabulary for metadata with a minimum loss 
of metadata elements. The DataBio convertor transforms GeoDCAT into KML that can be 
directly displayed in a GIS application without the need of a specific metadata catalogue. 

 

Figure 11: KML visualization of INSPIRE metadata for Sentinel-1 dataset series, 
originally published in the GeoDCAT/RDF70. 

Publication of metadata as linked open data was the primary goal of the Dutch GDI 
(Geonovum). The strategy for assigning URIs to the resources was achieved. The 
representations (formats) for each resource are available. New experiences with establishing 
links across data sets and between data and metadata and new experiences with search 
engines crawling and indexing the resources were successful. OTN was able to set up a triple 
store and SPARQL endpoint for the datasets. Relevant datasets were linked to Datex II, and 
GTFS based semantic catalogues to publish the dataset as linked open data. The Linked Data 
interface of the ESA FedEO Gateway was fully implemented and deployed at ESA and 
Spacebel. It provides access to all metadata available through the operational FedEO 
Gateway but uses Linked Data RDF metadata encodings instead. Several encodings were 
tested, and the GeoDCAT-AP turns out as very relevant for the EO Collection Metadata 
encoding. 

Last but not least, there are several interesting outcomes on information mapping towards 
GeoDCAT-AP. The Information Flanders best practice proves that it is feasible to transform 
Metadata records from ISO 19119 and INSPIRE and translate these to GeoDCAT-AP with a

minimum loss of information and to publish DCAT-AP records as GeoDCAT-AP. The Czech 
GeoPortals have managed to automate the conversion of INSPIRE & ISO 19119 records to 
GeoDCAT-AP. The Geonovum testbed achieved a successful mapping of ISO 19139 
metadata records to GeoDCAT-AP by using an XSLT. 

And the OGC testbed was able to align OGC catalogue services and SPARQL services to 
improve semantics and adoption by search engines. 

3.9.3 Conclusions 
The best practice cases show satisfactory results in each of the four focus areas using 
GeoDCAT-AP. At least two best practice cases have a primary focus on each of the focus 
areas. The added value of GeoDCAT-AP was proved to integrate metadata from open 
datasets using DCAT-AP and geospatial datasets using ISO 19115/19119 and INSPIRE. The 
cases are showing the added value of GeoDCAT-AP and the mature implementation status. 

GeoDCAT-AP is a recent initiative (version 1.0.1 is available at the time of writing this 
Discussion Paper) and needs further integration and alignment. This is a logical evolution for 
every standardization initiative. In chapter 4 we describe the results of a comparative analysis 
between GeoDCAT-AP and ISO/INSPIRE XML. We also focus on future requirements and 
issues. 

GeoDCAT-AP plays an important and unique intermediate role connecting metadata 
standards and metadata publication and connecting Geospatial data and (open) non-geospatial 
data71. 

4. GeoDCAT-AP alignment and future integration 

The first three chapters focus on the existing GeoDCAT-AP initiative and study the role of 
GeoDCAT-AP in the metadata landscape. The best practice cases describe some successful 
GeoDCAT-AP implementations. Some of the cases formulate also future improvements and 
requirements. In this chapter, we focus entirely on how GeoDCAT-AP fills the gap between 
the ISO metadata, in particular the ISO metadata elements used by INSPIRE, formats and the 
exchange of metadata between portals and the publication of ISO/INSPIRE metadata on the 
web.  

The first part of this chapter describes a comparative analysis between GeoDCAT-AP and 
ISO/INSPIRE XML. The second part discuss future requirements of GeoDCAT-AP.

4.1 Comparative analysis between GeoDCAT-AP and ISO XML 
This part describes the results of the comparative analysis between GeoDCAT-AP and 
ISO/INSPIRE XML reference implementations based on ISO 19139 (and ISO 19115, ISO 
19119)72. Where relevant, the ISO 19139 XML can be converted automatically to 
GeoDCAT-AP, via the XSLT script ‘xslt script ‘iso-19139-to-dcat-ap.xsl.’  

A recent article73 from the EU ISA program explains how DCAT-AP can be implemented. 
This article also addresses a number of ISO/INSPIRE specific issues.

4.1.1 Multi language support 
The use of multiple languages is mentioned in the GeoDCAT-AP specification, and its 
reference implementation supports it74.Recognizing different metadata documents, in 
different languages, is supported by DCAT-AP and ISO 19139 XML. 

The way in which different languages for the text values are used is encoded as follows in 
XML and RDF: 

● In RDF it’s arranged at attribute level by annotation of literal values.  The RDF Data 
Model provides for language-tagged strings. 

● In the ISO 19139 XML Schema implementation, it is done by using a special textual 
type (gmd:LocalisedCharacterString) that allows multiple languages. 

The xslt script ‘iso-19139-to-dcat-ap.xsl’ provides an automated conversion of multilingual 
text fields from an ISO 19139 record into a DCAT record. 

The distinction between the language of the metadata and the language of the actual resource 
and of its distribution is done differently but is supported by GeoDCAT-AP (through the 
distinction between meta-metadata along: primaryTopicOf and the resource itself). 

4.1.2 Access Rights, Legal Constraints, Access Limitations 
In DCAT-AP licensing is specified at the level of data catalogs or at dataset distributions 
level, but not at the dataset level itself.  

This way different dataset distributions can have different licensing terms. 

DCAT-AP proposes to work with Access Rights (dct:accessRights) to specify those 
conditions and uses  dct:license (from Dublin Core) for use limitations related to intellectual 
property rights. 

Since the range of those properties is not a literal but a resource (of type 
dct:LicenseDocument or dct:RightsStatement) respectively, a URI is preferably used to 
identify the resource: 

[] a dcat:Distribution; 
dct:license <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>. 

In the absence of a URI, RDF allows a resource to be represented as a blank node. A blank 
node in combination with the use of an rdf:label property allows to map a literal, this is a free 
text field, which is commonly used in ISO19139 
(identificationInfo//resourceConstraints//accessConstraints).  For example:

       rdfs:label "CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication"@en; 

            ] 

 

4.1.3 Dataset, Dataset Series, and Services 
GeoDCAT-AP considers both ISO data sets and ISO data sets series as DCAT data sets 
(rdf:type). 

Therefore, it is impossible to derive from the DCAT description whether this rdf:type, is a 
dataset or a dataset series. 

To address this problem, an additional term has been added to GeoDCAT-AP dct:type (from 
Dublin Core terms) in which it is explicitly stated whether it is a data set or a data set series. 
So, two types are needed to correctly identify a resource in GeoDCAT-AP. 

As far as the INSPIRE notion of service is concerned, DCAT and DCAT-AP foresee a single 
class, namely, dcat:Catalog, which only matches the notion of ‘discovery service’ in 
INSPIRE. GeoDCAT proposes to encode other service types with the term dctype:Service 
from the DCMI Type Vocabulary. Additionally, the spatial data service type can be specified 
by using dct:type with the corresponding code lists operated by the INSPIRE Registry.  

<rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Catalog"/> 

AND 

<dc:type rdf:resource="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-
codelist/ResourceType/service"/> 

<rdf:type rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Service"/> 

<rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset"/> 

<dct:type rdf:resource="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-
codelist/ResourceType/dataset"/> 

         OR 

<dct:type rdf:resource="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-
codelist/ResourceType/datasetseries"/> 

 

 



OGC 18-001r1

A separate code list has been provided by INSPIRE75  

Within ISO / INSPIRE, there is a fairly strict distinction between services and data sets 
(series) while DCAT-AP works with different types of resources; And two attributes are 
required to enable the mapping: 'rdf:type' and 'dct:type'. 

In a guidance document by the EU ISA Programme76, the following way of working is 
proposed: 

● When interested in the individual parts of the dataset series: 

○ Describe these as separate data sets; 

○ DCAT and DCAT-AP do not have a mechanism for expressing relationships 
between data sets. GeoDCAT-AP suggests: A data set description is created 
using http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ResourceType/series as' 
dct: type ', linking to the components with' dct:hasPart ;' and 

○ The individual members of the series link back to the series with 'dct:isPartOf'. 

● When interested in the series as such, it is recommended to describe the members as 
multiple distributions of the same dataset. To provide distribution coverage 
information spatial (Spatial) or temporary ('dct:temporal') metadata may be provided 
to the distribution. 

If it is not clear that it concerns a data set or whether it is a data set distribution, then it is best 
to combine the two ISA methods as described above. 

To indicate sequences, DCAT-AP suggests to work with 'dct:hasVersion / dct:isVersionOf' 
and through the underlying 'owl: versionInfo'. The "adms:versionNotes" element can then 
indicate the difference between the different versions77. 

4.1.4 Coordinate reference systems 
In ISO/INSPIRE metadata, the coordinate reference system is not guaranteed to be expressed 
as a URN or HTTP URI, as opposed to the srsName attribute in GML78. 

<gml:Polygon srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:26986">  

<gml:exterior>  

<gml:LinearRing> 

    <gml:posList> 45.256 -110.45 46.46 -109.48 43.84 -109.86 45.256 -110.45

    </gml:posList>  

</gml:LinearRing> 

  </gml:exterior> 

 </gml:Polygon>  

 

In ISO/INSPIRE metadata it often occurs like a text blob. For example: 

 

<gmd:RS_Identifier> 

<gmd:code> 

<gco: CharacterString> Belge_Lambert_1972 (31370) </gco:CharacterString> 

</gmd:code> 

<gmd:codeSpace> 

<gco:CharacterString> EPSG </gco:CharacterString> 

</gmd:codeSpace> 

</gmd:RS_Identifier> 

 

 

While it seems appropriate to use the HTTP URI definition corresponding to a recognized 
coordinate reference system.  

For example, for the Belgian Lambert72 this should be noted as 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/31370. GeoDCAT-AP provisionally uses the 
(overloaded) property dct:conformsTo to denote the coordinate reference system.  

[]  a dcat:Dataset ; 

 dct:conformsTo <http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/31370> . 

4.1.5 X Spatial extent 
The encoding of spatial extent is metadata vocabularies requires further attention.  

The 'gmd:extent' is not always formatted in the same way, usually in 
'EX_GeographicBoundingBox'. 

 



OGC 18-001r1 

51

<gmd:geographicElement> 

<gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox>

<gmd: northBoundLatitude> 

<gco:Decimal> 51.5 </gco:Decimal> 

</gmd:northBoundLatitude> 

</gmd:EX_GeographicBoundingBox> 

</gmd:geographicElement> 

 

For example: 

If a "BoundingPolygon" is given instead of "GeographicBoundingBox," the metadata may 
originate from a source conforming to the American model NIEM79. 

As there is no agreement on a preferred format for encoding geometries in RDF, GeoDCAT-
AP adopts the approach taken by GeoSPARQL and the W3C location vocabulary (locn) to 
encode them as literals. Geometry literals can be provided in one or more encodings, at least 
one of which must be GML or WKT. The above bounding box can for example be 
represented as a WKT polygon or a GML envelope. 

[] dct:spatial [ a dct:Location ; 
       locn:geometry "POLYGON((2.4 50.6,2.4 51.5,5.9 51.5,5.9 50.6,   
                       2.4 50.6))"^^gsp:wktLiteral ; 
       locn:geometry "<gml:Envelope srsName=\"http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326\"> 
                        <gml:lowerCorner>2.4 50.6</gml:lowerCorner>

                      </gml:Envelope>"^^gsp:gmlLiteral ] . 

 

It sometimes occurs that no information about the coordinate reference system has been 
provided. In principle, this only occurs when the coordinates are in 'WGS84'. 

GeoDCAT-AP also caters for the concept of geographic identifier, which could be 
represented for example as   

[] dct:spatial  <https://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/CZE>  

in RDF.  

4.1.6 Metadata status 
For mapping the status codes, there is the option in (Geo)DCAT-AP to map on the controlled 
vocabulary for status80 defined in the context of the Asset Description Metadata Schema81 
(ADMS), which is a metadata application profile to describe data models and reference data. 
The URIs for these statuses are no longer dereferenceable. Furthermore, not all (exactly) 
overlap with the ISO / INSPIRE statuses:  

http://xml.fmi.fi /namespace/woml/swo/2011/11/15/index337.html. 

For example: 

<gmd:status>  

<gmd:MD_ProgressCode codeList = 
"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/resources/Codelist/gmxCodelists.xml#MD_ProgressCode" codeSpace 
= "ISOTC211 / 19115" codeListValue = "" /> 

... 

</ gmd:status> 

ADMS status vs. ISO status: 

● http://purl.org/adms/status/1.0 (4 possibilities) 

● http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ISO_19139_Schemas/resourc
es/codelist/gmxCodelists.xml (at least 7 possibilities)

GeoDCAT-AP uses an 'adms:accrualPeriodicity' property here.  

The range of this property is a resource (often identified with a URI) and not a mere codelist 
value.

4.1.8 Spatial representation type 
In ISO / INSPIRE, the 'SpatialRepresentationType' uses different code lists. In ISO / 
INSPIRE, these are recognized code lists. In GeoDCAT, the lists are proposed by the EU, but 
strictly speaking, not binding, as other possibilities may occur. 

See also: https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/issue/geodcat-ap-how-
encode-spatial-representation-type. 

Example: 

 

The "spatialRepresentationType" is usually defined at ISO / INSPIRE dataset level, while it 
is defined in GeoDCAT at the Distribution level. 

4.1.9 Distributions

about: 'offline access', 'order' and 'search'). 

The conversion through the standard XSLT procedure has problems with the distributions, 
especially if no "function" has been provided for a specific distribution. For services (i.e. 
"dcat: catalog") this problem does not occur. 

4.1.10 Spatial resolution 
In GeoDCAT-AP, spatial resolution is only available under "human-readable" format while 
in ISO / INSPIRE, it is primarily machine-readable format.

Example: 

 

If the resolution represents a scale, this may be converted. But when the resolution shows a 
distance, it is not clear whether this can be converted in a standardized manner. 

In the GDI-Vlaanderen Best Practices for Metadata, the following is prescribed: 

● Scale: is always the denominator of the fraction (1: xxx); and 

● Distance: we take Best Practices-wise in meters. 

Because no existing terms were found at the time of writing GeoDCAT-AP and no new RDF 
terms are minted by GeoDCAT-AP, it has also been chosen to represent scale (spatial 
resolution) as a 'rdfs: comment' property in GeoDCAT-AP, which has little semantics. 

The spatial resolution property of http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19115/2003/metadata 
# d4e2105 offers more possibilities for the Resolution class. But this term/representation is 
currently not part of GeoDCAT-AP. 

4.1.11 Metadata codelists 
Some code lists have been released for GeoDCAT-AP lists through the EU portal. These 
code lists82 are compatible with ISO / INSPIRE. These lists contain mappings to the official 
ISO code lists. 

This may cause compatibility issues if changes occur in the official lists that are not 
immediately implemented in the mappings to the ISO / INSPIRE metadata code lists.  

                                                
82 http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/

These lists are used, among other things, for roles, themes, etc. 

4.1.12 Additional information 
For additional information from ISO / INSPIRE, no direct mapping is provided to 
GeoDCAT-AP. 

Example: 

<gmd:supplementalInformation> 

<gco:CharacterString> DOV -Geology - Geological 3D Model of Flanders, version 2 | http:  

//dov.vlaanderen.be/dovweb/html/2geologisch3Dmodel.html and ... / gco:CharacterString> 

</gmd:supplementalInformation> 

 

In order to get this up, it is possible to use a vocabulary: 
http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19115/2003/metadata#d4e3338. 

This vocabulary has made an OWL / RDF representation of a selection of elements contained 
in the ISO / INSPIRE standards. 

However, this vocabulary is not used in GeoDCAT-AP and thus has no "official" character. 

4.1.13 Format 
In GeoDCAT-AP, the format may be a URI that redirects to the description of the format or a 
blank node with a label that describes the format. 

4.1.14 Contact information 
Contact information is optional in RDF, but required in ISO INSPIRE. Through validation 
against the ISO XSDs contact information can be enforced. In the case of GeoDCAT-AP, or 
DCAT for that matter, SHACL is a standardized way of validation (see 2.2.3). At present, 
only a SHACL expression of DCAT-AP83 exists.

4.2 Conclusions 
The GeoDCAT-AP specification does not replace the INSPIRE Metadata Regulation nor the 
INSPIRE Metadata technical guidelines based on ISO 19115 and ISO19119. Its purpose is to 
give owners of geospatial metadata the possibility to achieve more visibility by providing an 
additional RDF syntax binding. There is a huge interest from different communities 
(meteorologic, statistics, defense because of NATO) and the EU Member States alike. The 
major use case is indeed the fact that EU Member States/organizations want their spatial data 
sets to be visible within geospatial and open data portals. 

GeoDCAT-AP is developed under the EU ISA Programme and needs to be compliant with 
the ISO/INSPIRE regulation (ISO 19139, 19115, 19119). This compatibility is essential for 
the implementation of GeoDCAT-AP by the 28 EU Member States. For the non-EU Member 
States, it is essential that GeoDCAT-AP is also compatible with ISO 19139, 19115, 19119 
and DCAT.   

The comparative analysis between GeoDCAT-AP and ISO/INSPIRE/XML makes clear that 
it is possible to encode metadata records according to the GeoDCAT-AP that can describe 
ISO and INSPIRE metadata records with only a partial loss of information. 

Because there is no complete coverage from GeoDCAT-AP to deliver all possible ISO or 
INSPIRE metadata elements in an exact 1 to 1 conversion in both directions, it is only 
possible to have a 100% mapping for a subset of ISO/INSPIRE metadata. Nevertheless, 
GeoDCAT-AP is a very mature initiative to bring metadata on the web and to integrate the 
metadata semantics used in the open data sector and the Geospatial sector.

The ESA OBEOS (Ontology Based Earth Observation Search) project aimed to extend the 
operational ESA FedEO Gateway with Linked Data interfaces compliant with W3C LDP 1.0 and 
W3C DCAT and GeoDCAT-AP interfaces to facilitate discovery of Earth Observation Collection 
Metadata.

Through this additional RESTful FedEO API, all EO collection metadata accessible through 
FedEO (based on various formats including OGC 11-035r1 and ISO 19139-2), including 
metadata from NASA CMR, NASA CWIC, JAXA, DLR, EUMETSAT, VITO, CNES and many 
other EO data providers behind FedEO become immediately accessible as Linked Data.  For 
product metadata discovery, a similar approach was implemented, but the CSIRO OM-Lite 
vocabulary (See OGC 15-100r1) was used to model Observation and Measurements product 
metadata based on OGC 10-157r4.  The original W3C DCAT encoding evolved recently to a 
GeoDCAT-AP encoding through additional developments performed during an INSPIRE 
Hackaton (September 2017) in the context of the H2020 DataBio84 project.  

The OBEOS project also implemented an open-source CKAN extension able to interact with the 
above FedEO API.  

 

5.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

The objectives of the OBEOS demonstrator included: 

● Publication of EO metadata for collections and products using the Linked Data paradigm. 
● Provision of  a fully standards-based implementation and use commonly accepted 

vocabularies 
● Link to recognised authorities providing Linked Data URI for satellites, instruments, 

science keywords, coordinate reference systems etc. 
● Investigation enrichment of EO collection metadata landing pages using schema.org 

annotations (JSON-LD) 
● Provision of selected components of the demonstrator as open-source. 
● Being easily integrated in the operational FedEO Clearinghouse at ESA. 

 

5.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages) 

- Description of the approach followed to achieve the pilot goals.  
- Description of the implementation and reasoning why decisions were taken.  
- The implementation details like detailed code lists or extensive data model descriptions 

can be integrated into the annexes. 

 

A W3C LDP 1.0 and LDP 1.0 Paging compliant interface was defined allowing for two-step 
search (EO Collections followed by EO products). It has the same capabilities as the operational

FedEO interfaces which are SRU-based and return Atom responses. It allows specifying the 
expected media type as a request parameter or via content-negotiation. The interface was wrapped 
in OpenSearch Description Documents compliant with OGC 10-032r8 and OGC 13-026r8, and 
the “void” vocabulary was used to provide the information about the product search interface 
inside the EO collection metadata. It supported the media types RDF/XML, Turtle and JSON-LD. 

The metadata for an EO collection is encoded as a dcat:Dataset and mappings of the other 
attributes can be found in OGC 16-074. Also RDF encodings for OpenSearch responses and EO 
Product metadata are proposed in this document and implemented in the demonstrator. 

Information in the metadata about topic category, science keywords, satellite or instrument refers 
by URI to the corresponding definitions (in RDF) by GEMET, GCMD and other authorities.  

No metadata harvesting is performed. The various RDF encodings are generated on-the-fly as-
needed based on the legacy metadata provided by the distributed catalog endpoints in response to 
OpenSearch requests (which can be a single URI).  

5.7 Results 

Results: (Max 1 page) 

Description of the achieved results. Description of the importance. Pros and cons (Because this is 
a best practice it is important that the pros are more prominent than the cons). 

 

The Linked Data interface of the FedEO Gateway was fully implemented and deployed at ESA 
and Spacebel. It provides access to all metadata available through the operational FedEO 
Gateway, but uses Linked Data RDF metadata encodings instead. 

The RDF encoding implemented as part of the demonstrator/project was documented in the OGC 
document OGC 16-074 “EO Metadata Discovery using Linked Data” available on the OGC 
Pending documents list.  Some of the project software was published as open-source software85. 

The encodings presented in the above document served as input to actual implementation 
specifications (in JSON and JSON-LD) for EO Product Metadata (OGC 17-003), EO Collection 
Metadata (OGC 17-047) and EO OpenSearch Responses (OGC 17-084) which are currently being 
prepared by a dedicated EO Product Metadata and OpenSearch SWG at OGC, supported by the 
CEOS WGISS86 community.  As JSON-LD is also a possible encoding of RDF, care is being 
taken to define the JSON(-LD) encodings to allow for compatibility through normative JSON-LD 
contexts with widely accepted  vocabularies. In particular GeoDCAT-AP is very relevant for EO 
Collection Metadata encoding.

5.8 Conclusions 

Conclusions:  (Max 5 lines) 

A brief description of the overall conclusion of the test. Conclusions about the ease of 
implementation, ease of use, repeatability. 

 

The OBEOS Project showed the feasibility of LInked Data encoding (JSON-LD) of EO collection 
metadata  using W3C DCAT and the evolution towards GeoDCAT-AP.  GeoDCAT-AP allowed 
for the main EO Collection properties to be mapped. The analysis is currently continuing during 
work on OGC 17-084, analysing required mappings for NASA UMM-C metadata as well. 
However, the JSON/JSON-LD approaches for metadata encoding proposed in the recent OGC 
17-003, OGC 17-047 and OGC 17-084 are based on GeoJSON and OWS Context (OGC 14-
055r2). Further work and possibly changes are needed to GeoDCAT-AP 1.0.1 and/or OGC 14-
055r2 to allow specifications to be based on both simultaneously and use a JSON-LD @context 
document for interpretation of JSON as JSON-LD (RDF). The following are just examples of 
current inconsistencies (a full analysis is to be performed still): 

● OGC 14-055r2 encodes the time interval as a single “date” property including both start 
and stop. GeoDCAT-AP uses two separate subproperties (of dct:temporal): 
schema:startDate and schema:endDate. 

● OGC 14-055r2 uses simplified encoding for “publisher” and “creator” (string) which are 
not compatible with the GeoDCAT-AP definitions of these properties. 

 
We would recommend to update OGC 14-055r2 to have its property definitions/types inline with 
the equivalent GeoDCAT properties. 

GeoDCAT-AP (via the locn:geometry property) uses an obsolete version of GeoJSON to encode 
GeoJSON literals and an obsolete media type for GeoJSON.  It should be updated to use RFC 
7946 instead.  It might be considered to allow for GeoJSON(-LD) to be included (not only as 
literal) as well. 

It would also be useful for GeoDCAT-AP to define a “profile”87 identifier which can be used to 
identify the RDF vocabulary that clients can expect in responses from (OpenSearch) service 
endpoints.  In OBEOS, we used the following media type and profile identifier to refer to JSON-
LD compliant with GeoDCAT 1.0.1. 
application/ld+json;profile=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/154143/ 

 

 

                                                
87 Uses "profile" to indicate RDF vocabulary as proposeded in "Negotiating Profiles in HTTP", draft-svensson-accept-profile-00, available 
at http://profilenegotiation.github.io/I-D-Accept--Schema/I-D-accept-schema.

General introduction about the initiative, project,... (Focus on only general goals and the pure 
business story). More specific GeoDCAT-AP related goals must be integrated into the “Goals” 
section below. 

 

OGC Testbed-12 developed a crosswalk to evaluate interoperability between different metadata 
specifications. The metadata specifications included the OGC I15 (ISO19115 Metadata) 
Extension Package of the CSW ebRIM Profile 1.0, NSG Metadata Foundation (NMF), DGIWG 
Metadata Foundation (DMF), DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS) and the W3C 
Data Catalog (DCAT) specification. Several initiatives have demonstrated interoperability 
between different metadata specifications through the development of crosswalks that provide 
mappings between the two specifications, for example Go-Geo. Whereas previous work has 
included ISO 19115, none of the crosswalks developed by previous initiatives have included the 
NMF, DMF, DDMS and DCAT. The crosswalk is described in the following engineering report 
http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/16-
062.html#_interoperability_in_multi_catalogue_environments 

The NSG Metadata Foundation (NMF) defines the conceptual schema profile for specifying 
geospatial metadata in and for the US National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). It is a 
profile of ISO 19115:2003/Cor 1:2006. The DGIWG Metadata Foundation (DMF) provides a 
general Defense metadata profile for the exchange of metadata between DGIWG member nations. 
It is a profile of ISO 19115:2003/Cor 1:2006. The DoD Discovery Metadata Specification 
(DDMS) specifies a set of metadata fields that are to be used for describing any information 
resource, that is to be made discoverable to the DoD Enterprise. It is a profile of the Dublin Core

metadata specification. DCAT is a vocabulary based on the Resource Description Framework 
(RDF) and designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogues published on the Web. 
It is a profile of the Dublin Core metadata specification. 

 

6.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

The OGC Testbed-12 metadata crosswalk was developed within a work package focusing on 
Catalogue and SPARQL services. The goal of the Testbed-12 work was to: 

● Improve understanding of the potential for semantic enablement of OGC catalogue 
services 

● Improve interoperability between OGC catalogue standards and open search standards 
currently adopted by several general search engines 

● Increase awareness of registry capabilities such as change control management, which are 
supported by specific profiles of OGC catalogue standards 

 

6.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages) 

- Description of the approach followed to achieve the pilot goals.  
- Description of the implementation and reasoning why decisions were taken.  
- The implementation details like detailed code lists or extensive data model descriptions 

can be integrated into the annexes. 

 

The overall requirement of the Catalogue and SPARQL aspect of the testbed was to advance use 
of the Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standard through evaluation of catalogue 
interoperability: This testbed would load the same dataset to a set of catalogues and test, using a 
multi-catalogue client, the interaction with each service to better understand interoperability 
aspects in multi-catalogue environments. The work would also evaluate the various DCAT 
contexts including RDF accessible via SPARQL endpoints, embedded in HTML pages as RDFa, 
or serialized as e.g. RDF/XML or Turtle and compare functionality, expressiveness and usability 
of CSW and DCAT.  

To address this requirement, the testbed adopted the following approach. The testbed: 

● Evaluated interoperability aspects in multi-catalogue type environments, including CSW 
featuring ISO based metadata and OpenSearch, a second CSW offering a SOAP binding, 
and a third DCAT implementation that described the same services and data sets using 
RDF. This was achieved through design and application of a functionality crosswalk. 

● Evaluated how DCAT could describe the same service and data sets in RDF as the other

catalog services do using XML Schema Documents (XSD) compliant to ISO 1939 and 
ISO 19115. This was achieved through design and application of a metadata crosswalk. 

● Implemented four different catalogues (CSW 3.0, CSW 2.0.2, CSW ebRIM, DCAT) and 
showed how they could interact. This demonstrated the role that DCAT could play in such 
a federation of catalogues, as well as supporting the assessment of the metadata 
crosswalks. An illustration of the implemented architecture is shown in the following 
figure.

Description of the achieved results. Description of the importance. Pros and cons (Because this is 
a best practice it is important that the pros are more prominent than the cons). 

 

The testbed found that dataset metadata from I15, NMF, DMF and DDMS could be mapped to 
the following DCAT Dataset metadata fields: 

● dcat:Dataset property dcat:contactPoint 
● dcat:Dataset property dct:temporal  
● dcat:Dataset property dcat:accrualPeriodicity 
● dcat:Dataset property dct:title 
● dcat:Dataset property dct:description

● dcat:Dataset property dct:issued  
● dcat:Dataset property dct:identifier 
● dcat:Dataset property dcat:keyword 
● dcat:Dataset property dcat:theme 
● dcat:Dataset property dct:modified  

 

The testbed also found that distribution metadata from from I15, NMF, DMF and DDMS could 
be mapped to the following DCAT Distribution metadata fields: 

● dcat:Distribution property dct:format 
● dcat:Distribution property dcat:downloadURL 
● dcat:Distribution property dcat:byteSize 
● dcat:Distribution property dct:rights 
● dcat:Distribution property dcat:mediaType 

 

The testbed also found that catalogues (feature catalogues and metadata catalogues) could be 
partially described through the dcat:Catalog class. 

The testbed found that an extension to DCAT is required to allow for detailed descriptions of web 
services. This is because the focus of DCAT is on datasets and catalogues, rather than web 
services in general. OGC Testbed-12 therefore designed a Semantic Registry Information Model 
(SRIM) by extending DCAT. The SRIM is introduced in http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/16-
059.html 

6.8 Conclusions 

Conclusions: (Max 5 lines) 

A brief description of the overall conclusion of the test. Conclusions about the ease of 
implementation, ease of use, repeatability. 

 

The testbed found that DCAT on its own has a limited geospatial vocabulary. However, when 
integrated with GeoSPARQL to create GeoDCAT it provides a geospatial vocabulary capable of 
supporting catalogue federation. The testbed recommended that the OGC should standardize the 
GeoDCAT specification. The testbed also found that the metadata returned by the different 
catalogues ranged from ISO 19139 XML, NMIS, DDMS, ebRIM ExtrisicObjects etc. The testbed 
recommended that catalogue services should be enabled to offer a GeoSPARQL service endpoint 
that publishes metadata in GeoDCAT and can receive federated SPARQL queries from other 
GeoSPARQL services.

7.4 Intro 

Intro: (Max 4 paragraphs) 

General introduction about the initiative, project, etc. (Focus on only general goals and the pure 
business story). More specific GeoDCAT-AP related goals must be integrated into the “Goals” 
section below. 

 

Open geospatial data is the focus of OTN (Open Transport Networks) EU funded project. OTN 
aims to integrate (metadata) of Inspire compatible transport related geospatial datasets with open 
transport related datasets.  

Both the open data world and the geospatial data world have long lived separately, but are now 
slowly drifting together. This is reflected in the conversion of standards describing open data and 
standards describing geographical data. 

Recent activities are aiming to bridge the gap between the open data and geospatial worlds led to 
defining GeoDCAT-AP. GeoDCAT-AP is the first sector-specific extension of DCAT-AP and 
explains how to map the attributes defined in ISO 19115/19119 and INSPIRE to the DCAT-AP 
format. It was developed by a working group chartered in the framework of the EU Programme 
“Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations” (ISA).  

GeoDCAT-AP has a core and an extended version; the former uses only the attributes provided 
by DCAT, while the extended version adds several geo-specific attributes. GeoDCAT-AP is not 
meant as a replacement for the ISO or INSPIRE standards, but is intended to enable users to 
distribute their metadata in a semantic way using DCAT and to facilitate the exchange of 
metadata between different portals. The OTN project aims to implement the profile and test its 
applicability, and so contribute to the standardisation process.

7.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

The OTN Hub has several non-trivial requirements. The Hub is dealing with a mix of spatial and 
non-spatial data, and these data need to be discoverable through its metadata. 

The metadata must be easily searchable using one single and easy to use interface. 

Following the standards mentioned in the preceding section would ensure interoperability with 
other systems, which is vital. From a user point of view, we want an intuitive way of uploading 
and visualising data. Changes to the data by a user should be propagated through the system 
without delay. 

Most of the requirements are related to metadata. Metadata harmonisation of spatial and non-
spatial datasets and services is essential to enable a uniform way of querying metadata. 
GeoDCAT-AP was an obvious choice due to the combination of geospatial and open data 
practices. 

7.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages) 

- Description of the approach followed to achieve the pilot goals.  
- Description of the implementation and reasoning why decisions were taken.  
- The implementation details like detailed code lists or extensive data model descriptions 

can be integrated into the annexes. 

 

To fulfill the OTN goals, it turned out that a combination of multiple software packages were 
needed to fulfill the requirements. OTN used a combination of software solutions specialized in 
SDI metadata management, DCAT data management & querying.  

Though GeoDCAT-AP itself does not specify a querying mechanism, it can be queried if loaded 
in an SPARQL endpoint. 

In OTN, a combination of multiple software packages to fulfil all requirements was chosen. In the 
following paragraphs, we will give an overview of all used packages. 

MICKA is a system for metadata management used for building spatial data infrastructure (SDI) 
and geoportal solutions. It contains tools for editing and the management of spatial data and 
services metadata, and other sources (documents, websites, etc.). MICKA is used as metadata 
catalogue in the OTN project, and also for instance in the Czech national INSPIRE geoportal. 
GeoDCAT RDF/XML is generated from existing ISO 19139 / INSPIRE metadata in the 
catalogue according to the rules defined by the GeoDCAT-AP specification. 



OGC 18-001r1 

103

In addition to Micka, CKAN is also implemented. CKAN is an open source data management 
and publishing tool supporting DCAT. It is a deployable web portal that acts as a data catalogue, 
where users can search and view for datasets of their interest. Acting as a catalogue, CKAN keeps 
track of the location of the actual data and their metadata. Using an extension, CKAN supports 
DCAT to import or export its datasets. This support was further developed by contributions from 
the OTN project (as to being able to import the DataTank DCAT, see further in chapter 4). 
CKAN enables harvesting data from OGC CSW catalogues, but not all mandatory INSPIRE 
metadata elements are supported88. Unfortunately, the DCAT output does not fulfil all INSPIRE 
requirements, nor is GeoDCAT-AP fully supported. 

7.7 Results 

Results: (Max 1 page) 

Description of the achieved results. Description of the importance. Pros and cons (Because this is 
a best practice it is important that the pros are more prominent than the cons). 

 

The Open Transport NET - GeoDCAT-AP implementation best practice aimed at publication of 
DCAT to ISO, on the contrary to the previously described results. The combined solution used in 
OTN combines CKAN and Micka. CKAN is used as the entry point for new datasets (spatial or 
non-spatial), either as a file upload or as a harvest from another data portals. Webhooks a CKAN 
extension scans for changes and notifies an intermediate CKAN2CSW module, which was 
created for the scope of OTN. This module requests the full details of any changed datasets and 
translates these into CSW transactions that are pushed to Micka. In this way, Micka is kept 
synchronised with CKAN. Micka serves as metadata catalogue and is the single point of entry for 
the portal. GeoDCAT-AP can be generated on the fly for the various queries.

A brief description of the overall conclusion of the test. Conclusions about the ease of 
implementation, ease of use, repeatability. 

 

Following existing standards is vital for interoperability. Both the open data and the geospatial 
world have stable standards, and GeoDCAT-AP is the first attempt in combining the two. 
Combining several software packages seems to be the best approach until GeoDCAT-AP gets 
better adoption. 

Relevant datasets were linked to Datex II, and GTFS based semantic catalogues to publish the 
dataset as linked open data.

8.4 Intro 

Intro: (Max 4 paragraphs) 

General introduction about the initiative, project,... (Focus on only general goals and the pure 
business story). More specific GeoDCAT-AP related goals must be integrated into the “Goals” 
section below. 

 

Metadata are understood as something boring as well as a must originating from standardization 
and/or legislation. Such impression is several times emphasized by the fact that users, similarly to 
producers, need to work with a special application, i.e. a metadata catalogue and/or metadata editor. 
The GeoDCAT is not an exception. “Traditional” ways of metadata visualizations represent a 
burden for a user who would like to focus on his/her work, however needs to deal with metadata in 
a special application. 

Our approach aims at really user friendly work with metadata in a commonly used application, the 
Google Earth (in the KML format). The motto of our slightly heretic Best practice is: “The best 
metadata platform is the one not shown to a user”. Such approach targets laymen while specialized 
metadata applications are still relevant for geospatial information professionals. 

Metadata of Sentinel-1, Deimos and Cryosat-2 images were used for the Google Earth demo 
presented in this Best practice as one of the achievements of the European DataBio (Data-Driven 
Bioeconomy) research and development project (https://www.databio.eu/).  

 

8.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

● Define transformations from GeoDCAT into the KML. 
● Develop mechanisms for user-friendly visualizations of (Sentinel-1, Deimos and Cryosat-

2) dataset series in the Google Earth application. 
● Make the convertor for GeoDCAT to KML publicly accessible for further re-use. 
● In general, user friendly visualization of satellite images collections (dataset series). 

 

8.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages)

Metadata of Earth Observation resources are hard to be visualized in any metadata platform as they 
are heterogeneous as well as interconnected in several ways, such as series of satellite images vs. a 
mission. Consider viewing a dozen of metadata records, each representing a satellite image, in a 
form that is being used in geospatial domain as depicted in the following Figure. 

 
The SpaceBel company developed the FedEO Clearinghouse with several extensions as described 
in section 3.2. The GeoDCAT is one of the output formats besides the ISO 19139 compliant 
encoding known also for European metadata falling under the INSPIRE Directive. 

The OpenSearch interface is available in the FedEO Clearinghouse under the URL 
http://geo.spacebel.be/opensearch/request/. An example query returning the GeoDCAT metadata 
for Sentinel-1 collection of satellite data may be found under this URL.

On the contrary, applications for GeoDCAT visualization are scarce. Even when a GeoDCAT 
visualization application is found, it is usually a non-user friendly one, intended for professionals 
to check whether a GeoDCAT file has an appropriate content and is valid. 

Freely available convertor was developed for the transformations from the GeoDCAT into the KML 
format (https://dev.bnhelp.cz/projects/dcatconv/). The KML export may be then visualized in the 
Google Earth application for the whole collection as depicted in the following Figure.

The geospatial extent of available satellite images is the primary information displayed to a user. 
When clicking in the satellite image extent, a bubble with further metadata appears. Note that the 
information shown in the bubble are customizable. For instance, a link displaying the full 
GeoDCAT metadata may be available. 

8.7 Results 

Results: (Max 1 page) 

Description of the achieved results. Description of the importance. Pros and cons (Because this is 
a best practice it is important that the pros are more prominent than the cons). 

 

The main achievement is the developed convertor from the GeoDCAT into the KML format that 
is publicly available (https://dev.bnhelp.cz/projects/dcatconv/). 

 

 

The most important pros are: 

● user-friendly visualization of GeoDCAT metadata in the Google Earth application; 
● running for all kinds of metadata for satellite images including collections (dataset series); 



OGC 18-001r1

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● functional verification for Sentinel-1, Deimos and Cryosat-2 satellite images; 
● easy to use tool as proven during the hackathon at INSPIRE 2017 conference in 

Strasbourg; 
● freely available to all interested persons. 

 

The most important cons are: 

● the convertor is currently a “black-box”; 
● all customizations need to be managed by the originators. 

8.8 Conclusions 

Conclusions: (Max 5 lines) 

A brief description of the overall conclusion of the test. Conclusions about the ease of 
implementation, ease of use, repeatability. 

 

The DataBio project demonstrated the feasibility of user friendly GeoDCAT metadata visualization 
without a specialized metadata platform. It was verified that even metadata collections (metadata 
of dataset series) could be visualized in a way not overwhelming a user. The developed form of 
visualization is targeting metadata laymen to disseminate metadata of geospatial resources to the 
public. 

The developed tool may be further customized in ways enabling: 

(1) conversion to more formats than the KML; 
(2) modifications of the information displayed to a user typically in a form of a bubble in the 

Google Earh API.

Intro: (Max 4 paragraphs) 

General introduction about the initiative, project,... (Focus on only general goals and the pure 
business story). More specific GeoDCAT-AP related goals must be integrated into the “Goals” 
section below. 

 

The Czech Republic uses two independent portals providing metadata information. The Czech 
National INSPIRE Geoportal is a single access point for INSPIRE based spatial data, and the 
Czech central metadata catalogue provide information about non-INSPIRE datasets and services. 

The Czech central metadata catalogue is using the Czech National Metadata profile. The central 
metadata catalogue is INSPIRE compliant but also supports some extensions. 

9.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

The Geo-DCAT implementation has several goals:  

● Testing the Geo-DCAT implementation on the existing metadata catalogue (CSW 2.0.2) 
● ON-LINE tool for transformation INSPIRE metadata to GeoDCAT  



OGC 18-001r1 

117 

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● Platform for automatic translation between Czech INSPIRE geoportal and Czech Open 
Data Portal (harvesting INSPIRE metadata as Geo-DCAT feed) 

● CENIA (Czech Environmental Information Agency) is responsible for portal operation 
● The portal is intended for INSPIRE support at national level 

In the future the Czech National Inspire Geoportal will extended with: 

● Continuous updates according to changes in INSPIRE metadata profiles, services  etc… 
● Communication with Czech national Open Portal. 

9.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages) 

- Description of the approach followed to achieve the pilot goals.  
- Description of the implementation and reasoning why decisions were taken.  
- The implementation details like detailed code lists or extensive data model descriptions 

can be integrated into the annexes. 

 

The metadata catalogue used on Czech National Geoportal was extended to provide output of 
stored INSPIRE compatible metadata (ISO 19139 XML) as Geo-DCAT RDF/XML with use of 
XSL templates. The templates differ from the ones provided by JRC because multilingual support 
and additional mapping/vocabularies were required.  

The modified CSW uses the same parameters and query mechanism as INSPIRE CSW, but Geo-
DCAT outputSchema can be used for Geo-DCAT feed output. (No SPARQL endpoint is used 
now). 

Also, RDFa HTML pages are generated for single metadata records to provide structured 
information for search engines. 

Catalogue client was extended to provide the same transformation for predefined catalogues used 
on the geoportal or on the fly connected catalogues to get Geo-DCAT metadata. 

ON-LINE INSPIRE to Geo-DCAT transformation tool was developed and placed on the 
geoportal for users who want to transform their metadata and don’t want to store them on the 
National Geoportal. 

9.7 Results 

Results: (Max 1 page) 

Description of the achieved results. Description of the importance. Pros and cons (Because this is 
a best practice it is important that the pros are more prominent than the cons). 

 

The Czech geoportal uses today GeoDCAT in several ways. You can test the output yourself

(https://geoportal.gov.cz/web/guest/catalogue-client?query=geol*). 

1. The Czech geoportal has included a CSW client with GeoDCAT RDF/XML output (available 
on the top bar at metadata detail panel).  

 

2. A RDFa compatible HTML page is available for every dataset. This page offers a structured 
overview of the metadata. The example below is about the absolute height of the buildings in 
Prague (https://geoportal.gov.cz/php/micka5/page/DDBD51D9-CDF6-4288-8FAB-
F049BB5ADFD9?lang=eng ).

3. ON-LINE tool for data conversion from Inspire metadata format to the GeoDCAT metadata 
format: https://geoportal.gov.cz/web/guest/metadata/geodcat/ 

4. Till the end of 2017 also a connection to the Czech Open Data Portal is planned. Therefore a 
DCAT support on the Open Data Portal side is needed.  

9.8 Conclusions 

Conclusions: (Max 5 lines) 

A brief description of the overall conclusion of the test. Conclusions about the ease of 
implementation, ease of use, repeatability. 

 

The Czech GeoDCAT & Inspire implementation is a working example on how both initiatives 



OGC 18-001r1

can be implemented and work together.  

Positive:  

● Interoperability with Open Data initiatives; 
● Transparent solution with no requirements from the user to change their data; 
● Simple seamless implementation in CSW; 
● Using vocabularies and registres  improve quality and reusability of metadata. 
● Use of GeoDCAT enables better interoperability with non-geospatial world. 

Improvements: 

● The test is based on previous version of INSPIRE metadata profile (1.x) without use of 
gmx:Anchor, so many text elements are difficult to convert to URIs; It will be fixed as 
new metadata profile (2.0.1) is implemented (till end of 2017). 

● Some metadata elements should be added to INSPIRE metadata profile for better 
implementation of semantic web (e.g. URIs for extent etc.). 

● The GeoDCAT as it is, is not fully compatible with INSPIRE metadata (mapping 
denominator etc); 

● GeoDCAT is not fully compatible with DCAT-AP (e.g. catalogue class), so we have 
problems with DCAT validators;

Intro: (Max 4 paragraphs) 

General introduction about the initiative, project,... (Focus on only general goals and the pure 
business story). More specific GeoDCAT-AP related goals must be integrated into the “Goals” 
section below. 

 

The central question in the whole Geonovum spatial data on the web test setup was how to use the 
power of the World Wide Web to make geo-information more accessible? This testbed was 
organised in 2015-2016. Starting with some relevant research questions, commercial parties 
began to experiment with publishing geodata on the web.  

GeoDCAT-AP was tested as one of the tools/techniques to translate Inspire, ISO 19139 metadata 
records to a format that can be picked up by the most commonly used search engines on the web. 

The text below is a partial representation of the description of the Geonovum testbed

10.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

Finding, accessing and using data disseminated through spatial data infrastructures (SDI) based 
on OGC web services is difficult for non-expert users. The Geonovum research has investigated 
how to improve this while keeping the current spatial data infrastructures intact. I.e., “we have 
been exploring ideas how to realise synergies between the existing spatial data infrastructures and 
the developments on the Web of data”. 

Different techniques have been tested. One of the work items was to transform ISO 19139 records 
to GeoDCAT-AP compatible RDF. 

 

10.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages) 

- Description of the approach followed to achieve the pilot goals.  
- Description of the implementation and reasoning why decisions were taken.  
- The implementation details like detailed code lists or extensive data model descriptions 

can be integrated into the annexes. 

 

The approach was to design and implement an intermediate layer between the SDI and the Web 
using proxies that will make data and metadata from the OGC web services available using the 
following principles that were considered important from a Web perspective: 

● All resources are identified using persistent HTTP URIs; 
● All interaction is using the HTTP protocol and consistent with its design; 
● All resources are discoverable via search engines; 
● Resources can be accessed and understood by citizens and developers; 
● Resources are either explicitly linked using HTTP URIs or data is structured so that links 

can be established dynamically.

The intermediate layer consists of a number of proxies introduced on top of the WFS (data 
service) and CSW (metadata service), making the contained resources available for other 
communities and supporting the practices they follow. 

 

 

The proxy layer is intended to support: 

● Search engines - Search engines generally use the schema.org ontology, use HTTP URLs 
as identifiers and limit their encodings to RDFa/Microdata and JSON-LD; 

● Linked Open Data (LOD) community - Use a minimal set of common ontologies, such as 
those from the DBpedia project; 

● e-government community - Require the use of authoritative ontologies (DCAT, 
“basisregistraties” (key registries), INSPIRE); 

● Web API developer community - Don’t use ontologies, but have additional best practices, 
such as GeoJSON, Swagger, CKAN, etc. 

 

One of the used proxy approaches is the use of GeoDCAT-AP. In the context of the Geonovum 
testbed, a mapping of ISO 19139 metadata records to GeoDCAT-ap has been made. The approach 
is described in the geo4web-testbed90. 

Together with the GeoDCAT-AP specification, an XSLT has been released which can transform 
ISO 19139 metadata to GeoDCAT-AP. This XSLT was used to improve existing RDF export 
capabilities in GeoNetwork. Until recently RDF/XML could only be exported from GeoNetwork 
using an RSS type of search. In recent versions RDF/XML can also be exported using CSW and 
as a full catalogue dump. Only RDF/XML is supported, no transformations to turtle or JSON-ld 
are currently available. 

The GeoDCAT-ap XSLT has been improved on a number of aspects: 

                                                
90 https://github.com/geo4web-testbed/topic4/blob/master/spatial-data-on-the-web-using-sdi-report.pdf  



OGC 18-001r1

Copyright © 2019 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● The GeoDCAT-ap XSLT tends to create frequent ‘blank nodes’, which is not forbidden, 
but a bad practice in linked data. Instead, GeoNetwork ‘mints’ URI's for new objects that 
are created as part of the mapping (e.g. organisations, locations, etc.). 

● The GeoDCAT-ap XSLT is quite ambiguous on the type of data-links available in the 
metadata. The reason is that INSPIRE metadata does not require to indicate the type of 
resource behind a link and XSLT has no capabilities to probe a link, to derive the type of 
resource. The Dutch meta data profile, however, requires data providers to indicate the 
type of resource behind a link, which facilitates the mapping for the type of data link. 

● The Dutch profile requires explicit conventions for stating types of open data licences. 
This facilitates the link to DCAT. 

An example of a transformed ISO 19139 document is available (see https://geo4web-
testbed.github.io/topic4/#h.hx52qgd16l66) 

Besides DCAT also the VOID ontology91 is relevant in the scope of our research. DCAT is widely 
used to describe traditional data sets in a structure other than RDF; VOID is used to describe 
datasets that are structured as RDF. As part of this research, we suggest ways to convert none 
RDF data structures to RDF. To make those structures discoverable on the semantic web, VOID 
is a relevant ontology. 

To facilitate Semantic Web Bots a SPARQL endpoint can be set up based on a (nightly) full RDF 
dump of the catalogue. Alternatively, semantic web users (bots and people) can follow links to 
metadata URI’s from external sources (using a content negotiation accept header 
“application/rdf+xml”). 

Besides GeoDCAT some other approaches were tested to make metadata available on the web; 
notably, HTML with embedded Schema.org microdata.  

GeoDCAT-AP is used as one of the representations of geodata on the web and has its value 
beside other representation techniques used. The primary value of GeoDCAT-AP lies in 
providing a machine readable RDF format of rich geo-metadata derived from ISO 19119 & 
Inspire metadata records without losing a lot of valuable (geo)information. Providing metadata 
records as GeoDCAT-AP is expected to improve discoverability in the open data / linked data 
communities because open data portals can harvest each others metadata using DCAT. The 
metadata records were also published as HTML+schema.org, because search engines will index 
this, thus improving discoverability of said metadata on the web.

The focus of the testbed can be summarized as a number of test implementations to test and 
improve: 

● The crawlability and linkability, i.e. making each resource available via a persistent URI 
and ensure that all resources can be reached via links from a “landing page” for a data set; 

● Classification of the resources using vocabularies supported by the main search engines on 
the Web; 

● Discovery of spatial data by search engines; 
● Representations of data for consumption by humans (HTML), web-developers (JSON) 

and search engine crawlers (HTML with annotations); 
● Establishing and maintaining links between data. 

To a large extent the Geonovum testbed was successful implementing the intermediate proxy 
layer as an interface between the Dutch SDI and open data portals, search engine crawlers and the 
web developers community. The main results are: 

● The (meta)data resources were made available by the used proxies; 
● The mapping of the data and metadata resources to the schema.org vocabulary (plus the 

GeoDCAT-ap vocabulary for metadata) are achieved with a minimum of loss metadata 
elements; 

● The strategy for assigning URIs to the resources was achieved and tested; 
● The representations (formats), in which each resource are available; 
● New experiences with establishing links across data sets and between data and metadata; 
● New experiences with search engines crawling and indexing the resources. 

There are still some challenges to improve the data findability on the web: 

● Improve existing infrastructure to support dynamic linking between resources (features) in 
the dataset and to avoid incomplete and inconsistent metadata; 

● Web related challenges to make search engines more open in a way to understand how 
you can deliver your data in the best possible way and the implementation of a scheme 
based content negotiation besides a media based content negotiation.

Information Flanders - (Belgium), is integrating their open-data metadata and geo metadata in one 
single end-user portal and one integrated metadata management system. As EU member, Belgium 
and Information Flanders as one of the regional public agencies has to follow the Inspire metadata 
profiles. This means that IV is dependent on different metadata standards (DCAT-AP) for open 
data and (Geo DCAT-AP, ISO19115) for Geodata. 

The best practices below describe how Information Flanders integrates Open Data¨metadata 
records (DCAT-AP) and SDI (the Spatial Data Infrastructure of Flanders) metadata records (Geo 
DCAT-AP, INSPIRE, ISO 19115) using a schema-based approach. 

● DCAT-AP support based on the ISO19139 Scheme; 
● DCAT-AP support DCAT based on a new scheme. 

 

The general approach used in both Information Flanders experiments is to start from a GIS 
metadata management system and adapt this system to handle open metadata in a way that is also 
convenient for open data specialists without encumbering with extra geo-related fields. Two 
implementation scenarios were tested92. 

11.5 Goal 

Goal: Description of the best practice goal(s) (max 3 lines or a 5 point bullet list). 

 

The main goal is to build an integrated data portal where geospatial metadata and non-geospatial 
metadata are managed and published via one single system. The main challenge is to handle 
different metadata (geospatial data, open data, etc.) via a number of compatible input and output 
formats. The long-term goal is the integration of other schemes to support other specific metadata 
sources like statistical information. 

More specific, two different experiments to store and export metadata based on ISO19139 
Geographic information -- Metadata -- XML schema implementation were carried out to test a 
smooth metadata management. 

● Experiment 1: Support of GeoDCAT-AP metadata based on the existing ISO19139 
scheme; 

● Experiment 2: Support of GeoDCAT AP schema based on a new developed (GEO) DCAT 
based DCAT-AP schema plugin.

11.6 Approach 

Approach: (Max 2 pages) 

- Description of the approach followed to achieve the pilot goals.  
- Description of the implementation and reasoning why decisions were taken.  
- The implementation details like detailed code lists or extensive data model descriptions 

can be integrated into the annexes. 

 

The idea behind was to make metadata editing as simple as possible for the data provider. The 
‘once only’ principle whereby data must be inputted one single time is a critical element in this 
simplification approach. The idea behind both experiments was to use the same metadata 
management system to bridge the gap between geographic- and open data and to elaborate 
methods to reduce costs and to increase efficiency compared to wholly separated geo- and open 
data metadata systems. The general idea is to use a metadata management system for integrating 
metadata as a kind of middleware between the metadata standards itself and the publication via a 
data portal/catalogue93. 

 

A template-based approach using Geonetworks 394  was chosen. The advantage of a template 
based approach is that no code changes are needed, as long as the GUI remains the same for the 
used elements in ISO19139. This can be considered as a disadvantage because complex fields (for 
ex. Responsible authority) are based on the ISO metadata structure, and not on the DCAT-AP 
structure.

Proof of concept scenario 1: 

GeoNetwork 3.0 delivers an out-of-the-box an ISO19139 metadata export to DCAT. ISO19139 can 
be used for internal metadata storing. On the front-end side it is also possible to deliver data in other 
metadata formats like DCAT-AP. What concerns data input it is also possible to use different 
templates. These templates supports: 

● DCAT-AP based open data metadata template; 
● SDI Flanders (Inspire & SDI Flanders best practice-based metadata template) for datasets, 

dataset series, services and objects; 
● ISAD(G) based document metadata template. 

 

In this scenario, only a template need to be added. There is no coding needed on the condition that 
no other than the available graphical elements than needed for the ISO19139 template are used. 

The latter can be seen as a disadvantage, as complex fields (e.g., responsible authority) are based 
on the ISO metadata structure, and not those of DCAT-AP. 

In experiment 1, we create an Open Data metadata profile on GeoNetwork, illustrating how we can 
create, modify, and convert metadata records according to this profile to different formats. 

Brief overview of the necessary steps: 

● Setting up GeoNetwork version 3.0; 
● User account creation (admin, metadata editor profiles); 
● Import of existing metadata records; 
● Setting up a DCAT-AP metadata template for open data records; 
● Adding DCAT-AP metadata records; 
● Metadata record conversion towards DCAT-AP; 
● Making the http URI’s dereferenceable; 
● CSW export; 
● DCAT-AP metadata records validation; 
● Setting up a SPARQL endpoint; 
● Development of a SPARQL/XSL transformation to convert metadata to DCAT-AP XML.

● Defining a XML Schema for DCAT-AP; 
● Implementing a metadata template for DCAT-AP; 
● Development of XSL templates for visualising and editing metadata records; 
●  XSL transformation converting metadata to DCAT-AP RDF; 
● Development of a SPARQL/XSL transformation to convert metadata to DCAT-AP XML.

11.7 Results 

Results: (Max 1 page) 

Description of the achieved results. Description of the importance. Pros and cons (Because this is 
a best practice it is important that the pros are more prominent than the cons). 

 

The first experiment shows that it is technically feasible to manage both DCAT-AP metadata 
records and metadata records for SDI Flanders (ISO / INSPIRE) using a Geo Metadata 
management solution. The DCAT-AP metadata records can also be made available as Linked 
Data.  

If using the ISO option metadata structure is followed, it is less easy to reconstruct a pure DCAT 
based graphical user environment for open data metadata management completely.  

To not discourage Open Data users who need an input interface that is adapted to the information 
they need (without GIS specialist related fields), preference is given to implementing

“GeoNetwork Schematic Plugin for DCAT-AP” as described in the second experiment. 

The second experiment shows that it is technically feasible to manage both DCAT-AP metadata 
records and metadata records for SDI Flanders using a single metadata management solution. The 
DCAT-AP metadata records can be made available as Linked Data. 

As indicated above, this option offers the advantage of having a high degree of freedom regarding 
the customization of the graphical user interface. A minor disadvantage is the fact that the 
metadata database stores in different XML Schemas. This requires some attention if a bulk update 
of, for example, address information or licenses should occur. But here too, the use of code lists 
that refer to a set of predefined organisations and licensing conditions is the best solution. 

11.8 Conclusions 

Conclusions: (Max 5 lines) 

A brief description of the overall conclusion of the test. Conclusions about the ease of 
implementation, ease of use, repeatability. 

 

Both experiments made clear that it is possible to make use of XML based schemes to handle 
metadata input coming from different standards (DCAT and ISO/INSPIRE) and to store and 
manage them in a single (geospatial)metadata management system. Such an approach avoid 
double input of metadata (once only principle) and makes metadata input and editing more 
convenient. Such an approach also can reduce costs (one integrated system instead of multiple 
partially overlapping systems).   

This step could lead to further integration of open- and geospatial metadata portals. It is to be 
expected that such a portal integration based on an integrated metadata management system will 
increase the user experience.  

This XML scheme & template based technical approach has the advantage that no code changes 
are needed, as long as the GUI remains the same for the used elements in ISO 19139.
