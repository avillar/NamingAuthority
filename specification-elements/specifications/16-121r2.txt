i. Abstract 

This OGC Web Query Service (WQS) defines a service interface for retrieving any kind of 
subset of information provided by the server addressed. WQS is completely agnostic of any 
semantics and, therefore, not bound to any predefined structures, such as coordinates, fea-
tures, coverages, or metadata. This makes WQS particularly suitable for retrieval from heter-
ogeneous data offerings combining features, coverages, and catalog information in some ap-
plication-defined way. A second use case is selective retrieval from a Capabilities document 
to avoid downloading large such documents and performing extraction on client side. 

To this end, the Query request type is defined which, based on an XPath expression as input, 
extracts the matching information from the service’s offering and returns it (currently: as an 
XML document).

vii.  Future Work 

Extensions to this concept might address the following aspects: 

 Extending model capabilities from hierarchical structures (as supported now) to more 
general structures (such as semantic graphs); 

 Extending query capabilities from XPath to further, more powerful paradigms (such 
as SPARQL); 

 Adding further encodings, such as JSON; and 

 Adopting this functionality as part of OWS Common, given its general, overarching 
relevance.

1 Scope 

This OGC Web Query Service (WQS) specification defines how to selectively retrieve data 
from a server, without making any assumption about the data offered. 

2 Conformance 

This document establishes the following requirements and conformance classes: 

 query, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/req/xpath; the corresponding 
conformance class is xpath, with URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/conf/xpath. 

This is the mandatory conformance class of this specification. 

Standardisation target are WQS implementations (currently: servers).  

Requirements URIs defined in this document are given by 

 http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/req/req{reqname}, 

conformance test URIs are given by 

 http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/conf/req{reqname}. 

whereby {reqname} in the numbering scheme is to be substituted by the requirement identifi-
er provided in the text. 

Annex A of this document lists the conformance tests which shall be exercised on any soft-
ware artefact claiming to implement WQS.  

3 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in the above references 
apply. In addition, the following terms and definitions apply. An arrow “ “ indicates that the 
following term is defined in this Clause. 

3.1 
Offering [of a service] 
The complete information which a service provides for retrieval by clients, conceptually rep-
resented by a single XML document. 

4 Class Query 

4.1 Overview 

This Clause 4 defines the mandatory core requirements class, query. Clients and servers sup-
porting this query requirements class shall support XPath-based selection from a WQS serv-
er’s coverage offerings through a dedicated request type, Query, operating on the information 
offering of the WQS service, seen as a single XML document. 



OGC 14-121 

5 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

4.2 GetCapabilities request 

A server announces support of the query requirements class to a client by adding the URL 
identifying this extension to the list of supported extensions delivered in the Capabilities 
document. 

Requirement 1 – profile: 
A WQS service implementing requirements class query shall include the following URI in 
the Profile element of the ServiceIdentification in a GetCapabilities response:   
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/conf/query  

4.3 Query request 

4.3.1 Query request 

This request assumes an XML document on the server which is of some structure not speci-
fied further; in particular, no specific underlying schema is assumed. Part of this offering may 
be the Capabilities document, but this is at the discretion of the service. 

The XPath expression submitted is evaluated against this single conceptual XML document, 
and the result is returned to the client. 

Requirement 2 – request: 
A Query request shall adhere to Figure 1 and Table 1.

Requirement 3 - xpath: 
The query parameter in a Query request shall contain a syntactically valid XPath expression 
as per W3C XPath [1]. 

Example The following examples are valid expressions which may yield nonempty results on a Capabili-
ties document; specifically, it extracts all data formats supported by this server: 

 //formatSupported 
 

4.3.2 Query response 

The response to a successful Query request is a document (which may contain XML tags) 
containing the information extracted from the server’s offering in some appropriate encoding. 

Requirement 4 – response: 
The response to a successful Query request shall be given by the evaluation of the query 
argument against the offering of the WQS server. 

Note: A server may reject requests generating foreseeably excessive amounts of data, such as 
retrieving an image encoded in GML. 

Requirement 5 – encoding: 
The response to a successful Query request containing a format parameter shall be encoded 
in the format specified by the format parameter. 

Note 1: If no format parameter is provided in a request then the server may choose some de-
fault encoding on its own. 

Note 2: Container formats like GMLJP2, zip, etc. are particularly amenable to heterogeneous 
information retrieval. 

4.4 Request Encodings 

4.4.1 Overview 

This Subclause specifies the encoding of a Query operation for each WQS protocol binding 
that a client and server support. 

4.4.2 GET/KVP Encoding 

Requirement 6 – get-kvp: 
In a Query request using the GET/KVP protocol, a query parameter with value x shall be 
represented by an http key/value pair as follows, with x properly using http entities where 
required: 
  QUERY=x 

Example The following is a complete Query request in GET/KVP notation; it delivers a list of 
all coverage identifiers: 

http://www.acme.com/ows? 
  SERVICE=WQS & 
  VERSION=1.0 & 



OGC 14-121 

7 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

  REQUEST= Query & 
  QUERY=/Capabilities/Contents/CoverageSummary/CoverageId & 
  FORMAT=application/gml+xml 

4.4.3 XML/POST Encoding 

Requirement 7 – xml-post: 
A Query request using the XML/POST protocol shall be encoded as an wis:query element 
as defined in the XML Schema accompanying this specification. 

Example The following is a complete Query request plus a response (assuming success) in 
XML/POST encoding: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<wis:query xmlns:wis="http://www.opengis.net/wis/1.0"> 
    <wis:query> 
        /Capabilities/Contents/CoverageSummary/CoverageId 
    </wis:query> 
</wis:Query> 
 

4.4.4 SOAP Encoding 

Requirement 8 – soap: 
A Query request using the SOAP protocol shall be encoded as a wis:query element as 
defined in the XML Schema accompanying this specification. 

4.5 Exceptions 

Requirement 9 – exceptions: 
When a WQS server encounters an error while evaluating a Query operation the server shall 
return an exception report message from the list in Table 2 with a locator parameter value 
as specified in the right column of Table 2 for each exceptionCode listed. 

Table 2  — Query exception codes

Annex A 
 

Abstract test suite 

A WQS implementation must satisfy the following system characteristics to be conformant 
with this specification. 

Test identifiers are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/query/conf. The identi-
fier of each test consists of this path, a “/” (slash) character, and the name of the correspond-
ing requirement. 

A.1 Conformance Test Class: query 

The OGC URI identifier of this conformance class is: 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WQS/1.0/conf/query.  

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 1 

Test method: Send valid GetCapabilities request to system under test. Check Capabilities 
document returned whether it contains the required element in the proper 
position. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 2 

Test method: Send Query requests to system under test. Verify that the structures refer-
enced by the requirement are accepted by the server (and returned in re-
sponses, respectively), and only those. To this end, send both valid and vio-
lating requests; in case of automatically verifiable definitions (such as XML 
Schema), verify through appropriate tools; otherwise (such as with UML), 
implement according tests manually. Test passes if all conditions are ful-
filled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 3 

Test method: Send Query requests to system under test containing correct and incorrect 
XPath expressions in the query parameter. Check responses to contain an 
exception exactly for the incorrect parameters. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 4 

Test method: Send valid Query requests to system under test. Check that request was suc-
cessful and returned the appropriate result. 



OGC 14-121r2 

10 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium.  
 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 5 

Test method: Send valid Query requests to system under test containing a format parame-
ter with a valid MIME type identifying a format that allows representing the 
result. Check that the response is encoded in the format requested. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 6 

Test method: Send a valid Query request using the GET/KVP protocol to system under 
test following this encoding specification. Check that request was success-
ful. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 7 

Test method: Send a valid Query request using the POST/XML protocol to system under 
test following this encoding specification. Check that request was success-
ful. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 8 

Test method: Send a valid Query request using the SOAP protocol to system under test 
following this encoding specification. Check that request was successful. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled. 

 
Test Purpose: Requirement 9 

Test method: For each exception situation defined, send an invalid Query request resem-
bling such a situations. Check that the appropriate exception is returned. 

Test passes if all conditions are fulfilled.
