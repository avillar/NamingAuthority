i. Preface 

The Open GIS Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of more than 250 
companies, government agencies, and universities participating in a consensus process to 
develop publicly available geo-processing specifications.  This Draft Interoperability Program 
Report (DIPR) is a product of the OGC Critical Infrastructure Protection Initiative (CIPI), the 
objective of which is to provide a vendor-neutral interoperable framework that enables 
collaborating communities to rapidly and collaboratively publish, discover, integrate and use 
geospatial information concerned with the protection of critical infrastructure systems in a range 
of sectors.  Specifically, this document specifies an Enterprise Architecture viewpoint for a 
Critical Infrastructure Collaborative Environment (CICE). 

The OGC Critical Infrastructure Protection Initiative is part of the OGC’s Interoperability 
Program: a global, collaborative, hands-on engineering and testing program designed to deliver 
prototype technologies and proven candidate specifications into the OGC’s Specification 
Development Program.  In OGC Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of technology 
providers work together to solve specific geo-processing interoperability problems posed by 
Initiative sponsors. 

We note that while this document focuses initially on critical infrastructure protection in the 
United States and Canada, the Enterprise descriptions herein are positioned to address the CIP 
needs of other nations around the globe.  To assist in broadening the scope of examples used to 
describe the CICE, the authors of this document invite contributions from other national 
government representatives.  Please refer your contributions to the Points of Contact listed in 
section ii of this document.

1 Introduction 

This candidate specification addresses the Enterprise architecture viewpoint for a system 
dedicated to the protection of critical infrastructure components -- it is concerned with the 
describing the purpose, scope, and policies of a system.  ISO Reference Model for Open 
Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) (ISO/IEC 10746) is the framework adopted by the OGC for 
specifying its reference architectures.  The four main parts of the RM-ODP framework define 
viewpoints on open distributed processing (ODP) systems.   

1.1 Document Scope 

This Draft Interoperability Program Report (DIPR) specifies the Enterprise viewpoint for the 
Critical Infrastructure Collaborative Environment (CICE).  This open, distributed processing 
environment crosses organizational boundaries and includes a variety of components deployed 
within multiple communities.  The CICE leverages OGC Web Services to enable: 

 The publication of the availability of critical infrastructure services and data; 
 The registration and categorization of published service and data providers; and 
 The discovery of needed critical infrastructure services and data 
 The integration and application of critical infrastructure services and data 

Critical infrastructure is a very broad term that encompasses many large-scale systems in a range 
of sectors: energy, telecommunications, transportation, public health services, and more.  
Safeguarding such systems involves a myriad of political, economic, and legal issues that will 
not be raised here.  Rather, the CICE is more about the creation and maintenance of a common 
information operating environment to support operational, planning, and decision-making 
activities associated with critical infrastructure protection. 

1.2 Conformance 

Assessing conformance requires consistency across the various viewpoints (i.e., clear mappings 
of concepts) and across the models they define.  In general, the set of viewpoint specifications 
should not make mutually contradictory statements.  Furthermore, each specification should 
include correspondence statements that relate it to other viewpoints. 

1.3 Normative references 

The following normative documents contain provisions, which, through reference in this text, 
constitute provisions of this Interoperability Program Report.  For dated references, subsequent 
amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply.  However, parties to 
agreements based on this document are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the 
most recent editions of the normative documents indicated below.  For undated references, the 
latest edition of the normative document referred to applies.

2 The CICE Architecture 

The Critical Infrastructure Collaborative Environment (CICE) Architecture is a component of the 
OGC Reference Model, which is a living document that describes the architectural construct for 
the Open GIS Consortium’s geoprocessing interoperability specifications.  The CICE performs 
two roles in relation to the OGC Reference Model (ORM).  First, it is guided by the principals 
and established procedures of the ORM.  Second, it represents a key area of activity that 
develops and defines the ORM.  Through activities and initiatives such as CICE, the ORM is 
developed, and improved.   

2.1 Relationship to OGC and Other Architectures 

The CICE also contributes to other architectures through the ORM.  In the United States, the 
ORM contributes significantly to the National Spatial Data Infrastructure, and is characterized in 
the Geospatial Interoperability Reference Model (GIRM) being developed by the Federal 
Geographic Data Committee.  The GIRM is intended to be a document that will guide Federal 
Agencies in using reusable elements that are built on standards from ISO, ANSI, OGC and other 
consensus standards bodies (Figure 1).  The GIRM additionally will be used in the United States 
to facilitate the inclusion of Geospatial architectural elements into its Federal Enterprise 
Architecture (Figure 2).  Indeed, the ORM offers a core interoperability reference for NSDI 
architectures around the globe including the Australian Spatial Data Infrastructure, the Canadian 
Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI), and many others.

Initiatives.

Figure 2.  FGDC’s GIRM Supports the U.S.  Federal Enterprise Architecture. 

While the process for inclusion may vary in other nations, the CICE and ORM Architectures will 
serve as a mechanism for incorporating geospatial functionality and geoprocessing specifications 
into National-level Information Technology and Electronic Government Architectures.  
Opportunities for such actions exist in nations such as Canada, the Netherlands, the United States 
of America, and other nations, which either currently have or are developing National 
Architectures. 

2.2 Relation To Spatial Data Infrastructures 

Around the world over 50 Nations are developing Spatial Data Infrastructures to help them 
improve their ability to find, access and more effectively use geospatial information and 
technology in their governmental and business activities.  These national activities are supported 
by regional collaborative efforts in Asia and the Pacific, Europe, the Americas and Africa and an 
emerging Global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) effort. 

While there are many differences in economic, social and legal frameworks around the world, 
the GSDI is being fueled by widespread agreement on common approaches in many fundamental 
Spatial Data Infrastructure development and implementation practices.  Through the 
coordination efforts of the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Steering Committee (now the GSDI 



 13

Association), the GSDI is taking on a clear form and substance.  It consists of standardized 
Geospatial Metadata, a Network of Spatial Data Clearinghouses operating on common standards 
based protocols, an emerging agreement on a set of core data sets that will be globally available 
to serve as base data for SDI linkage, for common use in spatial data applications, and for further 
attribution and densification for larger scale use.  Figure 3 depicts critical aspects of the GSDI.  It 
is enabled by common standards and architectures which are developed / endorsed by 
international, national and voluntary standards organizations.  The GSDI is made up of an array 
of local, national and regional spatial data infrastructures supporting user's needs for spatial data 
and services.  SDI’s further support a wide variety of user applications and maintain consistent 
growth in their utility through user interaction and constant infusion of new or refreshed data 
resources and an improving set of services and applications.

Geoff – same as in the other figure I don’t seem to be able to change this.  I wanted to change 
“Global” on the Globe to “Global Spatial Data Infrastructure”  



 14

A final and equally critical component is the emergence of a common geoprocessing technology 
architecture for use around the world in spatially enabling government and business enterprises.  
The CICE feeds this technical architecture and provides real examples of application of 
interoperable Geospatial technology specifications and, through the OGC Specifications 
Program, the specifications themselves that are incorporated into the Information Technology 
Architectures identified above.

3 CICE Enterprise Viewpoint 

The Critical Infrastructure Collaborative Environment (CICE) Architecture is based on the need 
to enhance the ability of organizations and individuals to use geospatial processing technologies 
in an open distributed processing environment to address issues associated with assuring the 
continuity, viability and protection of critical infrastructure.   

This open distributed architecture for CICE will be described from four non-overlapping 
viewpoints.  These viewpoints are:  Enterprise; Information; Computational; and Engineering 
viewpoints.  This collection of interrelated viewpoints will provide for the development of the 
CICE as an initiative that supports multiple technology goals within a business / mission-based 
structure.  It will also provide a way of ensuring that that the elements of the CICE become 
incorporated into the OGC Reference Model, Federal / National Reference Models and other 
appropriate models, so that specifications based reusable elements can be adopted for common 
use, not only within the Critical Infrastructure Community, but also within the entire geospatial 
information community.  CICE will be a source of new business needs, specifications 
requirements, initiative and specifications for the ORM.  These additions to the ORM will be 
incorporated through established OGC procedures for updating and maintaining the ORM.   

This description focuses on the Enterprise or Business perspective.  The Enterprise viewpoint is 
concerned with the purpose and scope of critical infrastructure protection and how it relates to 
the overall business areas of responsibility of government and the service specifications of 
government.  It will also cover the primary roles and interactions required to use interoperable 
geospatial information and technology in a dynamic, distributed, information-sharing 
environment.  The Enterprise Viewpoint has focused on government lines of business and 
business needs, but also is intended to address private sector needs.  While there is no 
comparable private sector Business Reference Model to the government models used, it is 
anticipated that the Enterprise Viewpoint will cover many of the key business functions 
involving geospatial processes that are transacted in the private sector. 

3.1 Critical Infrastructure Communities of Practice 

The Critical Infrastructure Community is simultaneously a defined community of relevant and 
affected interests and a dynamically changing community that potentially includes all 
governments, business and citizens, locally or even nationally.  The reason for this dynamic 
environment is that Critical Infrastructure Protection encompasses activities ranging from 
preparedness to response and recovery.  Critical Infrastructure Protection includes data, 
applications and services that are fully accessible and open to the public; data, applications and 
services that require security protection for authorized users only; and data, applications and 
services that are a mix of open and protected inputs and outputs.   

Critical Infrastructure Protection also requires a combination of pre-identified and assured data, 
applications and services along with access to the full range of data and services that are and will 



 16

increasingly become available through a robust set of compatible and interoperable spatial data 
infrastructures. 

The scope of Critical Infrastructure Protection ranges from local to national and global levels and 
can include all sectors.  However, for the purposes of describing an Enterprise view of the CICE, 
the scope of relevant and affected communities will be focused on the geospatial requirements 
necessary for assuring the protection of critical facilities, networks, systems and assets that are 
defined in national critical infrastructure policies. 

Crucial to the success of the CICE Architecture is a design that facilitates and accelerates the 
development of spatial data infrastructures that are compatible and enhance the use of geospatial 
processing technologies as enabling technologies for these spatial infrastructures from local 
levels of government to national and global levels of implementation and use.  The United States 
and Canada have active efforts within their national governments to focus policy attention and 
programmatic effort to assuring protection of critical facilities, networks, systems and assets.  
Each has defined, at the national level, the major components of its critical infrastructure.  For 
the purposes of the Enterprise Viewpoint, Critical Infrastructure Communities will be described 
as follows. 

3.1.1 Community Types 

Two types of domain Critical Infrastructure communities exist: Domain Communities and 
Federation Communities.  These communities may be created, modified, or disbanded at any 
moment in their lifecycle. 

3.1.1.1 Domain Communities 

A Critical Infrastructure domain community is one made up of organizations and individuals that 
have a common interest around a set of functional activities, a local geography, or 
responsibilities for similar operations.  In the CICE Enterprise, there can be an almost unlimited 
number of Domain Communities, which could form to address interests or concerns.  These 
Communities will be formed based on need and will be disbanded when that need is addressed or 
their purpose is no longer needed.   

Domain Communities form a basic foundation for organizing an Enterprise architecture.  
Therefore a relatively stable set of communities is needed to describe the enterprise.  Within the 
Critical Infrastructure Protection set of potential communities, there is a growing agreement on 
the definition of Critical Infrastructure Sectors.  In several countries, Critical Infrastructure 
Sectors have been defined by national level policy direction.  For this description, the North 
American Critical Infrastructure Sectors will be used to begin this definition of Domain 
Communities.  As the Architecture is used in other nations and global regions, Critical 
Infrastructure Sectors will likely be modified, but the basic elements of the Architecture is 
expected to remain relatively stable. 

North American Critical Infrastructure Communities 



 17

U.S.  Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

The Sectors that make up the critical infrastructure as initially described by Presidential Decision 
Document 63 and as modified by subsequent guidance for Homeland Security program 
implementation are:  

 Telecommunications  

 Banking and Finance 

 Water  

 Transportation 

 Emergency Services  

 Public Health  

 Energy  

 Defense Industrial Base 

 Agriculture and Food 

 Chemical Industry and Hazardous Materials 

 Postal and Shipping 

 Key Assets 

Canadian Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

Canadian Critical Infrastructure Sectors described by the Office of Critical Infrastructure 
Protection and Emergency Preparedness are: 

 Energy and Utilities (such as electrical power, natural gas and oil transmission systems 

 Communications (such as telecommunications, and broadcasting systems) 

 Services (such as financial services, food distribution, and health care) 

 Transportation (including air, rail, marine and surface) 

 Safety (such as nuclear safety, search and rescue, emergency services) 

 Government (including major government facilities, information networks or assets) 



 18

Commonality of U.S.  and Canadian Infrastructure Sectors 

While the two countries have identified their critical infrastructure sectors in somewhat different 
terms, there is common coverage for civil sectors.  The primary difference is that the U.S.  has 
identified Foreign Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and National Defense as Critical Infrastructure 
Sectors while Canada has not. 

From these relationships, a new consolidated set of eleven Critical Infrastructure Sectors was 
identified.  This set includes all of the Sectors from the U.S.  and Canada and is used only for the 
purposes of further analysis of the relationship of Critical Infrastructure Protection to 
government lines of business and government business drivers.  This consolidated set of Critical 
Infrastructure Sectors is: 

 Communications 

 Energy and utilities 

 Financial Services 

 Transportation 

 Law Enforcement 

 Fire 

 Government Operations 

 Public health and Services 

 Internal Security 

 Foreign Intelligence and Affairs 

 National Defense 

3.1.1.2 Federation Communities 

A CICE Federation Community is a larger grouping of Domain Communities.  It contains two or 
more members from Domain Communities.  For CICE, there are a number of ways in which 
Federation Communities could be envisioned.  They could consist of groupings of Sector 
Domains from a number of nations.  They could also consist of groupings of different sectors 
into multi-sector Federations or they could be multinational Federations or regional groupings of 
countries.  In the geospatial data community, regional groupings of nations are forming to 
address spatial Data infrastructure coordination and collaboration.  Based on these established 
regional structures, CICE communities may be subdivided into five broad categories.  These 
include: 



 19

 North American Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

 European Union Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

 Asia-Pacific Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

 South American Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

 African Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

3.1.2 Community Lifecycle 

3.1.2.1 Establishing a Community 

Within CICE, communities are formed based upon the need of the community.  Primarily, they 
are established based on mission responsibilities or lines of business that relate to any of the 
primary areas of Critical Infrastructure Protection: Preparedness, Detection, Prevention, 
Protection, Response and Recovery.  Likewise, a Critical Infrastructure Protection Community 
may form based upon geographic need.  While these are oriented towards geographic areas of 
responsibility, they will most likely be sub-structured to address lines of business and/or Critical 
Infrastructure Protection areas of responsibility.   

3.1.2.2 Assignment Rules 

Within the CICE Enterprise, behaviors for Communities are defined by each of the wide variety 
of Sectors or geographic areas for which a Community may exist.  For most communities, the 
behaviors will be guided by already established protocols and business rules for interaction.  For 
newly formed Communities which have not had previous collaborative efforts, new rules will be 
established based on the norms of the geographic area, or based on the consensus of the group.   

3.1.2.3 Changes in a Community 

Due to the nature of Critical infrastructure Protection, the CICE Environment will be flexible and 
subject to change.  A Community will change depending on the needs of the members and 
organizations and individuals will be added or deleted, rules can be modified to meet new 
circumstances and an established Community may evolve to a new Community as its 
membership and situation changes.  Such changes will be generally be achieved in a consensus 
process and will be focused towards meeting the broadest range of needs as possible of those 
interested parties.   

3.1.2.4 Disbanding a Community 

An established Community can disband as it completes its agreed upon tasks, meets its 
objectives, or otherwise no longer is needed.  The members will make, for the most part, such 



 20

determinations, but situations may exist where some other authority may disband a Community 
particularly where it was established by a specified authority.   

3.1.3 Communities of Interoperability 

Organizations implement a wide range of security policies and technologies, making it difficult 
to impose a common solution to allow direct interoperability between any two nodes.  For this 
reason, the concept of "interoperable communities" has been proposed to allow direct 
interconnections between communities as well as through the hubs (Figure 4).  This allows for 
multiple routes to be established between any two nodes. 

 

Figure 4.  Node and Hub Concept. 



 21

At a low-level, a "node" is a physical system on a network, including the computer and operating 
system.  In reality, a node is the physical system within any given enterprise that is able to 
interact with other enterprise systems, both internal and external. 

A "hub" is a type of node that is able to serve as a bridge between discrete communities.  This 
bridge allows each community to "interoperate" between one another.  A hub is able to negotiate 
between two or more interoperability agreements, which represent data exchange policies within 
an enterprise or community.  The interconnections within a semi-structured interoperable 
community allows direct connection between communities as well as through hubs.  This 
approach provides multiple routes between any two nodes and can accommodate a higher degree 
of fault tolerance than a structured and rigid interoperable community concept. 

All nodes within the CICE community will join “Interoperable Communities”.  Each 
Interoperable Community will enact and enforce it’s own set of interoperability agreements.  
Each node and Interoperable Community can belong to one or more Interoperable Community.  
A “core” set of interoperability agreements provide the nucleus around which Interoperable 
Communities can grow.  The bridge between communities is known as a “portal”. 

3.1.4 Community Characteristics 

3.1.4.1 Objectives 

The objective of Critical infrastructure protection is to ensure that citizens and critical resources 
and assets are protected to the greatest degree feasible from damage from natural or 
anthropogenic forces.  Within a structured government environment the processes for this 
protection is a component of the business activities of that government.  As Government 
Architectures are developed, Critical Infrastructure Protection specifications can be closely tied 
to the Government-wide Architectures. 

3.1.4.2 Behaviors 

Behaviors for the use of geospatial information and technologies in meeting the Business Needs 
of Critical Infrastructure Protection  are grounded in the needs of government to provide 
information and services to responders and others who need geospatial resources and 
functionality to detect, prevent, protect, respond and recover from potential threats to critical 
infrastructure assets.  In order for the CICE to address a wide range of government business 
activities, it must accommodate all of governments’ business drivers in a shifting array of access 
needs of the public and government authorized users.

3.1.4.3 Policies 

A wide range of organizations will establish policies within the CICE.  These will be established 
within the framework of national law, administrative regulation or by regional or local law or 
ordinance.  Within CICE, policy statements will usually be in the form of community agreements 
for service specifications, data specifications, and access/security requirements for the specific 
needs of the community.  Policy changes may affect the structure of the CICE Enterprise 
however, the makeup of the Architecture is such that it will be able to accommodate policy 
changes while still maintaining its basic operating environment and structure. 



 23

4 Operational Concept 

The CICE Enterprise view supports the Business Reference Model of the U.S.  Federal 
Enterprise Architecture and Government of Canada Federated Architecture.  Both of these 
National Government Information Architectures are meeting the needs of the key business 
drivers or lines of business within government.  Each has identified the business requirements 
differently, however, taken in totality the Common Requirements Vision (which includes 
Business Drivers and Business Information Requirements) of Canada and the Business 
Reference Model of the United States specify a full set of business areas and service 
requirements that can be applied to the CICE.   

The U.S.  Business Reference Model identifies three business areas; Service to Citizens, Support 
Delivery of Services, and Internal Operations and Infrastructure.  For the CICE, the Services to 
Citizens Business Area is a primary focus as it includes the mission or program goods and/or 
benefits that are part of the U.S.  Federal Government responsibility.  However, in assessing all 
of the potential components of critical infrastructure protection, all three Business Areas must be 
considered. 

In order to better understand the link of Critical Infrastructure Protection to government business, 
each Critical Infrastructure Sector was reviewed in relation to the lines of business identified by 
the U.S.  BRM.  The survey indicated approximately 75% of the lines of business are related to 
Critical Infrastructure Sectors.   

Critical Infrastructure Protection is firmly embedded in government Lines of Business, and is a 
fundamental part of the business requirements of both Canada and the United States by being a 
part of 75% of government’s lines of business and by requiring the information technology 
functionality of all of the identified business drivers. 

Three roles have been identified to illustrate how Critical Infrastructure Business requirements 
can be fulfilled based upon the standard Web Services Architecture.  These include: 

Provider – An entity that has data/information or services that will be made available for 
critical infrastructure activities. 

Requester – An entity that has a need for critical infrastructure data/information or 
services. 

Broker - An entity that provides information technology or information management 
capabilities for critical infrastructure activities that connects requesters and providers or 
which provide capabilities for the operation of the infrastructure. 

The CICE Architecture is based on a publish, find, and bind pattern.  This concept supports the 
dynamic binding between service providers and requestors since sites and applications are 



 24

frequently changing in a distributed environment.  These essential kinds of Web Services 
operations include: 

Publish: used to advertise data and services to a broker (such as registry, catalog or 
clearinghouse).  A service provider contacts the service broker to publish (or un-publish) 
a service.  A service provider typically publishes to the broker metadata describing its 
capabilities and network address.   

Find: used by service requestors to locate specific service types or instances.  Service 
requestors describe the kinds of services they’re looking for to the broker and the broker 
responds by delivering the results that match the request.  Service requestors typically use 
metadata published to the broker to find service providers of interest. 

Bind: used when a service requestor and a service provider negotiate, as appropriate, so 
the requestor can access and invoke services of the provider.  A service requestor 
typically uses service metadata provided by the broker to bind to a service provider.  The 
service requestor can either use a proxy generator to generate the code that can bind to 
the service, or can use the service description to manually implement the binding before 
accessing that service.   

Any given organization may assume one or more of these roles depending upon their business 
requirements.  For example, an agency may publish data to a node, making it available for 
consumption by authorized agents.  An authorized user in another organization would then  issue 
a request to discover or find data relevant to the mission requirements.  The user application may 
bind directly to the data provider if known, or a broker may assist in discovery of relevant 
datasets (Figure 5).

5 CICE Quality of Service 

Quality of service is an important factor in meeting the expectations of the stakeholders of a 
system.  The users of a system are typically not concerned with performance degradations in one 
aspect of a system, so long as the system as a whole performs to their overall expectations. 

5.1.1 Requirements on the Enterprise 

Several key elements will allow the CICE system to meet stakeholder expectations.  These 
include availability, reliability, and security.  Availability is the system’s ability to be ready for 
use, it’s performance capabilities, and it’s accessibility.  A system’s reliability includes it’s 
ability to be fault tolerant, meaning that there are no single points of failure, allowing the user to 
continue their use of the system.  Security is the ability for the system to preserve the integrity 
and confidentiality of the information. 

5.1.2 Requirements on Enterprise Interactions  

The successful interaction between enterprises and exchange of information relies on several 
characteristics.  These Quality of Service characteristics include: 



 26

Freshness - how up-to-date the information is (relevant to time-dependent information); 

Precision - with what granularity the information is expressed; 

Timeliness - requirements for request/response delays; 

Capacity – throughput; 

Accuracy - error probability; 

Security - access control, integrity, confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation; and 

Precedence - the sense of the importance of the interaction relative to others (for use in 
cases of shortage of resources or conflicts). 

In the case of the CICE, information is required to be up-to-date, precise, timely, accurate, and 
secure.  The CICE Architecture needs to support these characteristics in order to provide relevant 
information to system stakeholders (Table 1).

6 CICE Use Case Narratives 

6.1 System Concept: Cross Border Project  

For the CIPI-1 Initiative, a demonstration capability was developed around a realistic but 
fictional scenario involving chemical release along a major international transportation corridor.  
This scenario would require response and recovery activities from local, state, provincial, and 
national agencies, as well as coordination between nations at an international level.  The 
following narrative describes the situation: 

At 9:30 AM the Windsor, Ontario Police Department receives a report from the Mitchell Park 
area that a very heavy scent of chlorine gas has been detected in the air by local citizens.  While 
sending a patrol unit to respond a second call is received reporting the same heavy scent of 
chlorine gas 2 kilometers to the Southwest of Mitchell Park, and then a third near the intersection 
of Tecumseh and Huron.  The reports are plotted on a map, along with reported potential 
sightings of a commercial truck in the area. 

Concern develops that this commercial truck, enroute to the U.S. via either the Ambassador 
Bridge or the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, may be leaking its chlorine gas contents unknown to the 
driver.  The UN Codes for chlorine gas and other gaseous chlorine compounds are determined 
and cross matched to the City of Windsor’s database of known hazardous materials.  The 
resulting list of three chemicals and their respective UN Codes are then broadcast to local law 
enforcement, and emergency response forces in the Windsor and Detroit area.  

A series of notifications about this event are immediately communicated involving the Windsor 
Police, Canadian Customs, local Hazmat Response Teams (HMRT), the Ontario Provincial 
Police, the RCMP, the Ontario Emergency Measures Organization, the Federal Office of Critical 
Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness (OCIPEP), and DND.  Uncertain of the 
intent of the driver of the truck and his planned destination, the Detroit police are notified, which 
in turn triggers notifications on the United States side to the Detroit local Hazmat and terrorist 
response units, U.S. Customs, the Michigan Emergency Office, FEMA and NIMA. 

The Windsor EOC and the Wayne County EOC become the lead national Emergency Operations 
Centers (EOC) for Canada and the U.S. respectively. These lead EOCs serve to coordinate all 
activities and through co-production provide a continuously up-dated situation picture to all 
authorized responders. A specialized situation picture is provided to the media. Critical response 
teams are dispatched to the vehicle scene and to secure the Windsor-Detroit border crossings. 

The Windsor Police determine that the truck is tracking toward the Ambassador Bridge.  Nearing 
the border crossing plaza the truck is stopped by authorities to prevent further travel, and isolate 
the vehicle to minimize the damage.  The truck, now disabled, rests 300 yards from the river on 
the Canadian side of the border.  Authorities assess and project the threat areas that could be 



03-061 

 30

affected by the developing situation and issue a second series of public alerts to targeted groups 
and locations to maintain awareness of the developing situation and to direct actions such as 
evacuation and sheltering in place. 

The interfaces leveraged by first responders, EOC staff, and other local, state, and national 
officials should allow the user to access public, framework data (location, name, imagery etc) 
and have a protected area for more sensitive data (load classification, traffic flow and density and 
any vulnerability information).  The users, based on their access permissions, would be able to 
see either the framework data only or a combination of the open source and protected 
information.  Within the protected area, there would be varying degrees of permissions based on 
the role of the organization.  The vast majority of the information is available from a variety of 
government and private sector sources.   

The information requirements to deal with this situation will vary, both from between countries 
and between the various levels of government.  However, decision makers at all levels of 
government would be asking for data concerning the situation and information on the border 
crossings as well as population, traffic and weather information.   

Security managers and law enforcement agencies will need to track the vehicle and access 
protected information dealing with the vulnerabilities of the border crossings in the areas and the 
deployment of police and customs resources.  They will also need to have detailed information 
on the overall geographic layout of the border crossing area.  Once the truck reaches the border 
crossing, they will need to establish a security perimeter and be able to share that information 
with a variety of groups. 

Critical Infrastructure protection officials at all levels of government would require a modeling 
capability to present the most likely routes the driver could take, or potential impact to the area's 
population.  They would also have to overlay this information on accurate framework data 
covering not only the roads, but also the population and basic infrastructure information.  As 
well, they would also have to have access to protected information on vulnerabilities and 
infrastructure information.  They would also have to have access to DEMs and Imagery for the 
border area in both medium (10-25m resolution) and high (1 to 4m resolution) in order to assist 
their analysis and their presentation of the information to decision makers.   

If the vehicle is severely, or it appears likely that it sustained significant damage and the 
chemical is released, the consequence managers at the various levels of government will require 
information in order to deal with the situation.  Local officials have to be able to determine 
which areas may be affected, so they will need access to detailed street and population 
information on both sides of the border.  Provincial, state and federal officials will have to be 
able to access the local information in order to make decisions concerning the deployment of 
additional resources. 

Finally, throughout this scenario, there is a requirement for information to be fed to the media.  
This application should have the capability to seamlessly send approved, unclassified 
information to a web site that could be accessed by the media.

In this Cross Border scenario, a wide range of disaster management (DM) and emergency 
response (ER) activities are undertaken.  Many activities require geospatial support for data 
accessibility, data fusion, and security.  Recognition of all activities is important from the 
perspective that they may place constraints (e.g., timing and sequence) on geospatial-oriented 
activities. 

6.1.1 Actors 

There are three main classes of actors described in these activities: 

• The Media 

• The Lead Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) of which there is one for Canada and 
one for the U.S.  During this type of cross border incident, EOCs will likely be activated 
in all municipalities in the area of concern and at the state and provincial levels.  One 
EOC in each country will be designated as the lead to coordinate all activities.  It is 
assumed that these EOCs will provide the main portals for geospatial information for the 
scenario. 

• Federal Emergency Centers.  It is assumed that for Canada, this agency will be the Office 
of Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness (OCIPEP) with support 
from the Department of National Defense (DND) J2 Geomatics & Imagery.  In the U.S. it 
is assumed this agency will be the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
with support from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and U.S. Department of 
Defense (DOD) agencies.  The prime role of the Federal Emergency Centers is to access 
data, enforce information security policies, and to provide support in consequence 
assessment. 

There will be additional classes of actors in these activities including: 

• First Responders 

• Authorized Responders 

• Municipal Police  

• Police Dispatchers 

• Hazardous Materials Response Team 

• Threat Assessment Teams 

• National Counter-Terrorist Organizations 

• Public Alerting System Coordinator 



03-061 

 32

• Residents/Occupants 

6.1.2 Services 

The classes of service described in these activities are: 

• Data Access Services.  These are the services that provide access to the data needed by the 
actors. 

• Presentation Services receive data from Data Access Services, fuse that data and render it for 
display to the user. 

• Discovery Services provide a means for users to locate needed data and services. 

• Client Services provide a user interface and user-side logic for interfacing with the other 
classes of service.  The concept of a “situation picture” or “common operational picture” is 
introduced here as the main geospatial information product from multi-source fusion of 
intelligence 

6.1.3 Information 

The classes of information described in these activities are: 

• Vector data 

• Imagery data 

• Gridded data 

• Video data 

6.2 System Concept: Banking and Finance Sector 

This Use Case Narrative is focused on the Banking and Finance Sector and depicts a possible 
scenario that involves the high-level functionality and business requirements described for the 
CICE Enterprise Architecture.  However, while the initial emphasis is on the Banking and 
Financial Sector, the Use Case will demonstrate the need to quickly involve other Sectors of the 
CICE Community. 

A concerted effort is launched to disrupt the Banking and Financial markets of the world.  These 
efforts are both electronic and physical disruption primarily in G8 nations.  Major efforts from 
unknown sources are initiated to disrupt the electronic flow of information at major financial 
markets in G8 Nations.  These cyber attacks are quickly followed by bank robberies in the U.S., 
Canada, and Germany.  Over 10 robberies, often accompanied by violence and loss of life, are 
carried out within hours of the cyber attacks.  The intent of the attacks is to shut down the flow

of financial resources and business transactions and to create fear about the safety of citizens 
conducting normal daily personal banking chores. 

As the attacks begin, there is an immediate need for Accessibility to Critical Infrastructure 
geospatial information.  The Banking and Financial sector have the need to know where the 
cyber attacks are occurring geographically and to map electronic network information spatially 
to detect patterns and to identify potential sources of the attacks.  As the bank robberies begin to 
occur, they will likely be perceived as individual incidents, but as information is entered real 
time into law enforcement databases, a larger picture will quickly emerge.  In order to respond 
locally and understand the picture nationally and globally, access to geospatial information is 
necessary.   

Security functions are critical as protected financial information will be required to assess and 
respond to the situation.  Sensitive or classified information about terrorist organizations will 
also rapidly come into play and will need to be disseminated and used with great caution, but 
among a large number of dispersed users nationally and globally. 

A large set of Client Centered Service Delivery mechanisms will need to be deployed.  The 
requestors’ requirements for these services will be different depending on the portions of the 
attack that they are dealing with.  However, on a cumulative basis virtually all services of Spatial 
Data Infrastructures will be needed and with immediate and correct response in terms of 
Effective and Efficient Service Delivery.   

In responding to the global cyber attacks and to the local bank robberies, the following sectors, at 
a minimum, will be intimately involved: 

Banking and Financial – Sector initially attacked 

Communications - Telecommunications networks under attack 

Energy and Utilities – Provide the physical infrastructure for telecommunications and 
other electronics networks 

Law enforcement – Responding to Bank robberies 

Transportation – Potential escape routes for perpetrators of the Robberies 

Government Operations – To protect the integrity of national financial systems and 
market operations 

Key assets – Key facilities and commercial locations 

National Defense – Due to the global nature of the events immediate National Defense, 
Security, Foreign Intelligence and Diplomatic involvement is required.
