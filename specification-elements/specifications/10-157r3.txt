i. Preface 

This OGC Implementation Standard defines a profile of Observations and Measurements 
(ISO 19156) for describing Earth Observation products (EO products). 

Although this standard has been developed in the context of the Heterogeneous Mission 
Accessibility (HMA) project initiated by European Space Agency (ESA), the content is 
generic to Earth Observation product description. The metadata model described in this 
document is structured to follow the different types of products (Optical, Radar, …) 
which are not HMA specific. 

Suggested additions, changes, and comments on this draft report are welcome and 
encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message to editors.

Foreword 

 

This OGC Implementation Standard defines a profile of Observations and Measurements 
(ISO 19156 and OGC 10-025) for describing Earth Observation products (EO products). 

This OGC standard builds on, and should replace OGC 06-080, aligning the Earth 
Observation metadata to the more recent standards of metadata encoding for 
observations, as well as adding metadata for further categories of Earth Observation 
sensors. 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held 
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of 
any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be 
aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this 
document, and to provide supporting documentation.

Introduction 

This OGC Implementation Standard defines a profile of Observations and Measurements 
(ISO 19156 and OGC 10-025) for describing Earth Observation products (EO products). 

This profile is intended to provide a standard schema for encoding Earth Observation 
metadata to support the description and cataloguing of products from sensors aboard EO 
satellites.   

The metadata being defined in this document is applicable in a number of places where 
EO product metadata is needed: 

1. in the EO Product Extension Package for ebRIM (OGC 10-189). This extension 
package defines how to catalog Earth Observation product metadata described by 
this document. Using this metadata model and the Catalogue Service defined in 
OGC 10-189, client applications can provide the functionality to discover EO 
Products.  Providing an efficient encoding for EO Product metadata cataloguing 
and discovery is the prime purpose of this specification. 

2. in the EO Application Profile of WMS (OGC 07-063r1). The GetFeatureInfo 
operation on the outline (footprint layer) should return metadata following the 
Earth Observation Metadata profile of Observation and Measurements. 

3. in a coverage downloaded via an EO WCS AP (OGC 10-140). In WCS 2.0 (OGC 
10-084), the GetCoverage and DescribeCoverage response contains the metadata 
element intended to store metadata information about the coverage. The Earth 
Observation Application profile of WCS (OGC 10-140) specifies that the 
metadata format preferred for Earth Observation is defined by this document. 

4. potentially enclosed within an actual product to describe georeferencing 
information as for instance within the JPEG2000 format using GMLJP2. GMLJP2 
defines how to store GML coverage metadata inside a JP2 file.   

Earth Observation data products are generally managed within logical collections that are 
usually structured to contain data items derived from sensors onboard a satellite or series 
of satellites.  The key characteristics differentiating products within the collections are 
date of acquisition, location as well as characteristics depending on the type of sensor, 
For example, key characteristics for optical imagery are the possible presence of cloud, 
haze, smokes or other atmospheric or on ground phenomena obscuring the image.  

The common metadata used to distinguish EO products types are presented in this 
document for generic and thematic EO products (i.e optical, radar, atmospheric, 
altimetry, limb-looking and synthesis and systematic products). From these metadata the

encodings are derived according to standard schemas. In addition, this document 
describes the mechanism used to extend these schemas to specific missions such as the 
Sentinel-1 mission.

Earth Observation Metadata profile of Observations and 
Measurements 

1 Scope 

This document describes the encodings required to describe Earth Observation (EO) 
products metadata from general Earth Observation Product descriptions to mission 
specific characteristics. The document is a profile of the Observations and Measurements 
2.0 standard.  
 

2 Compliance 

EO Products metadata encoded using this profile of Observations and Measurements 
shall produce XML documents that are fully compliant with the normative XML Schema 
Documents associated with this standard (i.e. eop.xsd for general EO Products, opt.xsd, 
sar.xsd, atm.xsd, alt.xsd, lmb.xsd and ssp.xsd for optical, radar, atmospheric, altimetry, 
limb looking and “synthesis and systematic” products respectively).  

More specifically, compliance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant 
tests specified in Annex A (normative). The schematron rules (i.e 
schematron_rules_for_eop.sch) shall be used to check that an XML instance is compliant 
with Annex A.

7 Overview 

This section focuses on the purpose and requirements for this standard. In particular, the 
document describes the model of the Earth Observation Metadata defined as a profile of 
Observations and Measurements. 

7.1 General concepts 

The approach consists in modelling EO product metadata as a profile of Observations and 
Measurements – XML Implementation [OGC 10-025]. ISO definitions are specified for 
attributes where available, although not the full ISO schema is used for the structural 
definitions, which would lead to a less efficient overall structure. 

The general mechanism is to create a schema with a dedicated namespace for each level 
of specificity from a general description which is common to each EO Product to a 
restricted description for specific mission EO Products. Each level of specificity is an 
extension of the previous one.  

The General EO product schema is the main application schema for EO Product 
metadata. It is associated with the “eop” namespace. 

Each Thematic EO product schemas extends the “eop” schema: 

- The Optical EO Product schema is used to describe optical products. It is 
associated with the “opt” namespace; 

- The SAR EO Product schema is used to describe radar products. It is associated 
with the “sar” namespace; 

- The Atmospheric EO Product schema is used to describe atmospheric products. It 
is associated with the “atm” namespace; 

- The Altimetry EO Product schema is used to describe altimetery products. It is 
associated with the “alt” namespace; 

- The Limb Looking EO Product schema is used to describe limb looking products. 
It is associated with the “lmb” namespace; 

- The Synthesis and Systematic EO Product schema is used to describe “Synthesis 
and Systematic” products. It is associated with the “ssp” namespace; 

The idea behind this layered levels approach is to create an efficient schema set that 
describes EO Product metadata concentrating on the core metadata characteristics that 
differentiate an EO product within a collection. 



OGC 10-157r3 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 7 
 

 
 

The adoption of this layered schema structure is intended to facilitate the realisation of 
clients / viewers that understand the schema at various levels.  For example, since this 
profile extends GML and O&M, our products can be displayed by a generic GML 
viewer, which will see EO Products as features with a footprint and “unknown” metadata, 
or by an EO Product specific viewer, which will understand the semantics of these 
metadata (cf. Figure 1) 

 

Figure 1 : A layered view of O&M EO Products data. 

 

More precisely, a generic GML viewer capable of handling O&M will only understand 
the “O&M” vocabulary of the O&M document; a “Generic EO Products viewer” will 
understand the “O&M” and “eop” vocabulary of the O&M document; an “Optical EO 
Products viewer” will understand the “O&M”, “eop” and “opt” vocabulary of the O&M 
document. The “sen1” vocabulary will only be understood by a “Specific Sentinel-1 
Viewer” that extends the “Radar EO Products Viewer”. 

7.2 Observations & Measurements 

In natural language, the model states: 

An observation is an event that estimates an observed property of some feature of 
interest using a specified procedure and generates a result.

The quantity to be measured can be simple (a single temperature), or it may be a complex 
quantity such as a coverage. Remotely sensed images in the sense of their acquisition can 
be viewed as observations in which the result of the observation (value of the result 
property) is a remotely-sensed image product. 

 

Figure 2 : The basic Observation type 

 

The major elements of the model are indicated in bold and modelled through associations 
in the UML model. In addition, an observation has the following attributes and 
associations: 

 parameter (optional): for arbitrary event-specific parameters, e.g. instrument 
settings 

 phenomenonTime (mandatory): the time that the result applies to the feature of 
interest 

 resultQuality (optional): the quality of the result 



OGC 10-157r3 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 9 
 

 
 

 resultTime (mandatory): the time when the result becomes available (e.g. if 
postprocessing or laboratory analysis is required, it might be different to the 
phenomenonTime) 

 validTime (optional): the time period during which the result is intended to be 
used (e.g. if a meteorological forecast is modelled as an observation, then it is 
intended to be used during a specific period of time) 

 relatedObservation (optional): related observations providing important context 
for understanding the result 

 metadata (optional): descriptive metadata 

 featureOfInterest (mandatory): The association Domain shall link the 
OM_Observation to the GFI_Feature that is the subject of the observation and 
carries the observed property. This feature has the role featureOfInterest with 
respect to the observation. 

 observedProperty (mandatory): The association Phenomenon shall link the 
OM_Observation to the GFI_PropertyType for which the OM_Observation:result 
provides an estimate of its value. The property type has the role observedProperty 
with respect to the observation. 

 result: The association Range shall link the OM_Observation to the value 
generated by the procedure. The value has the role result with respect to the 
observation. 

 procedure: The association ProcessUsed shall link the OM_Observation to the 
OM_Process (6.2.3) used to generate the result. The process has the role 
procedure with respect to the observation. 

 

7.3 Earth Observation metadata mapping on Observations and Measurements 

To represent Earth Observation metadata, this profile extends the Observations and 
Measurements properties with EO specific information. Table 3 defines the awaited 
content of each Observations and Measurements property. Figure 3 shows the

7.3.1 Observed property 

The ‘observed property’ is mandatory for OM_Observation. 

 The standard XML encoding of observedProperty is a gml:ReferenceType.   

 It may be null with a nilReason if required, e.g. <om:observedProperty 
nilReason="inapplicable"/> 

 If there is a parameter property present within the EarthObservationResult then 
the observed property should point using xlink to the Phenomenon definition that 
is included as part of the eop:ParameterInformation.   

 If there is no parameter property present and the observedProperty is not left null, 
then the observedProperty should be an xlink to the observedPropery definition. 
The code list that is mandated is the NETCDF CF Standard names. An example 
of an Observed Property from this code list is:

standard-names/standard-name-table/15/cf-standard-name-
table.xml#sea_surface_height_above_sea_level”/>. 

 

7.3.2 Result time 

The OM_Observation ‘resultTime’ is the time at which the result became available. In 
general, this may be different to the ‘phenomenonTime’, which is the geophysically 
relevant time at which the final product applies. The times may be different when 
additional processing is performed to retrieve geophysical parameters. 

7.4 General rules  

We defined the following rules for creating the Earth Observation Metadata profile. An 
extension of this profile SHALL follow the same rules.  
 
7.4.1 Language rules 

Natural language is used as far as possible for property names. For instance, complete 
names for properties are preferred to abreviations. 
 
7.4.2  Extensions rules 

As seen in §7.3, we want each Earth Observation product to fit exactly the structure of a 
OM_Observation element. 
 
Thus, in the inheritance mechanism for thematic or mission specific namespaces, we need 
to extend existing properties defined in eop or create new properties that fit inside the 
model. 
 
7.4.2.1 Thematic extended namespace 

Thematic extended namespace (opt for example) contains: 

- opt "words"; 

- an opt:EarthObservation element that inherits from eop:EarthObservation. This 
inheritance is an XML schema extension (to avoid restriction problems) with no 
element added (because all elements fit inside one of the Observation property 
metadata, procedure, phenomenonTime, result or featureOfInterest);  

- one or more extensions of existing eop properties (see example below). 

For example, “opt” thematic EO Products metadata include the cloud cover percentage, 
named  “cloudCoverPercentage”. This property is described within the 



OGC 10-157r3 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 13 
  

opt:EarthObservationResultType element which extends and acts as a substitution for 
eop: EarthObservationResultType: 

 
<opt:EarthObservation> 
  […] 
  <om:result> 
   <opt:EarthObservationResult gml:id="eop_2"> > 
    […] 
    <opt:cloudCoverPercentage uom="%" >30</opt:cloudCoverPercentage>      

     […] 
   </opt: EarthObservationResult > 
  </om:result> 

   […] 
            </opt: EarthObservation> 
 
7.4.2.2 Mission specific extended namespace 

Mission specific extended namespace (Sentinel-1 for example) contains : 

- sen1 "words"; 

- a sen1:EarthObservation element that inherits from sar:EarthObservation. This 
inheritance is an XML schema extension (to avoid restriction problems) with no 
element added (because all elements fit inside one of the Observation property 
metadata, procedure, phenomenonTime, result or featureOfInterest ); 

- one or more extensions of existing sar properties. 
 
These rules are close to those described in the thematic extended namespace. However, 
the property extension approach leads to a drawback in the mission specific case. 
 
Indeed, from a client point of view, an “eop” enabled reader must encounter well-known 
structures under “eop” properties. This may not be a problem for “eop” and thematics 
schemas since they are completely described in this document (i.e. structure can be “hard 
coded”). 
 
However, a mission specific schema shall follow the rules described in this document but 
the content of this schema is not in the scope of this document. Thus a generic “eop” 
enabled reader should be able to process complex schema inheritance mechanisms to 
“understand” mission specific data.  
To avoid this drawback, we introduce an attribute "eop:type" at the eop level. This 
attribute is required for properties that extend one of eop or its thematic properties. This 
attribute is expected to contain the name of the property it extends directly. This 
mechanism is comparable to the ISO19139 gco:isoType. 

 
  
7.4.3 Units of measure 

Each non-angle property concerned by a unit of measure shall use the existing GML type 
<gml:MeasureType>. 



OGC 10-157r3 

14 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

 
Example : image resolution 
 
 <xs:element name="resolution" type="gml:MeasureType"> 
  <xs:annotation> 
   <xs:documentation>Image resolution</xs:documentation> 
  </xs:annotation> 
 </xs:element> 
 
Each angle property shall use the existing GML type <gml:AngleType>. 
 
Example : Instrument Across Track incidence angle 
 
 <xs:element name="instrumentAcrossTrackIncidenceAngle " type="gml:AngleType" minOccurs="0"> 
   <xs:annotation> 
    <xs:documentation>Instrument across track Incidence angle given in 
degrees.</xs:documentation> 
   </xs:annotation> 
 </xs:element> 
 
 
 
7.4.4 GML restrictive use 

We restricted the use of GML types to those relevant to the EO Products metadata 
description, i.e.: 

- gml:AngleType ; 

- gml:CodeListType ;  

- gml:MeasureType ; 

- gml:MeasureListType ; 

- gml:UnitOfMeasureType ; 

- gml:ReferenceType ; 

- gml:Point (expected structure : gml:Point/gml:pos) ; 

- gml:MultiSurface (expected structure : 
gml:MultiSurface/gml:surfaceMembers/gml:Polygon/gml:exterior/gml:LinearRing/gml:posList) 

- gml:TimePeriod 

- gml:TimeInstant

7.5 Requirements for XML instances 

To allow exchange of metadata, the conceptual model described in the previous sections 
must be encoded in XML. As a profile of Observations and Measurements, this document 
provides XML schemas that extend Observations and Measurements for XML. To 
generate these schemas, we adopt the model-driven approach of ISO TC211. This 
approach is described in Annex D. 

This section constitutes the core requirements class for all XML instances of Earth 
Observation Metadata profile of Observations and Measurements.  

XML representation of earth observation metadata requires use of the element 
eop:EarthObservation or a member of its substitution group.  

There is a dependency on the requirements classes for Observations and Measurements 
documents, defined in Clause 7.3 of [OGC 10-025].

8 EO Products schemas 

8.1 General EO product data schema 

The “eop” schema provides the description of metadata common to all EO Products 
derived from satellite based remote sensing.  
 
The root element of the “eop” schema, named <eop:EarthObservation> extends the 
<om:OM_Observation> type as follows : 

<element name="EarthObservation" substitutionGroup="om:OM_Observation" 
type="eop:EarthObservationType"/> 
    <complexType name="EarthObservationType"> 
        <complexContent> 
            <extension base="om:OM_ObservationType"> 
                <sequence> 
                    <element name="metaDataProperty" type="eop:EarthObservationMetaDataPropertyType"/> 
                    <element name="version" type="string"/>

The primary purpose of the identifier is to allow operations on a resource without 
ambiguities. For that reason, it is important to have a totally unique identifier that will 
never be generated twice by any system. This identifier will be used throughout the 
process of manipulating the product, from tasking to ordering. 

8.1.2 EarthObservationEquipment 

The eop:EarthObservationEquipment block contains metadata relative to the mechanism 
used during the EarthObservation.

Table 8 : <eop:EarthObservationResult> fields description 

The coverage element is foreseen in order to have the possibility to reference additional 
"exploitation" metadata of the EO Product.  
This exploitation metadata consists of detailed information on the spatial domain of the 
EO product (origin, offset vectors, grid envelope, axis labels) and the Range Structure 
(information on the available bands with their names, units of measure, data type and nill

value list). As this type of metadata is already defined by the GML 3.2 Application 
Schema for WCS 2.0 (OGC09-146) that is used within the wcs:CoverageDescriptions 
Element , it is proposed to let the coverage element defined in this specification refer to a 
wcs:CoverageDescriptions element that is returned in response to a WCS 
DescribeCoverage Request. In case the EO Product is offered by a WCS service, this 
proves a convenient manner to offer this type of metadata without duplicating the 
information. In case the product isn't offered by a WCS Service, an alternative HTTP 
GET URL could be used. 
 
An example of the use of the coverage element is: 
 
<eop:coverage 
xlink:href="http://hma.xxx.xx/wcseoserver/ows?Service=WCS&amp;Version=2.0.0&am
p;Request=DescribeCoverage&amp;coverageId=coverageId"/> 
 

8.2 Thematic EO product data schema 

The Thematic EO Product schemas provide the description of metadata common to a 
specific thematic category of EO Products. Thematic EO Products schemas extend the 
“eop” schema. 
 
8.2.1 Optical EO Product data schema 

The “opt” schema provides the description of metadata common to all EO Products 
derived from optical satellite based remote sensing. It describes the same fields as the 
“eop” schema plus specific fields for optical products. 
 
As described in §7.4.2.1, the root element of the “opt” schema, named 
<opt:EarthObservation> simply extends the <eop:EarthObservationType> type (with no element

8.2.4 Altimetry EO Product data schema 

The “alt” schema provides the description of metadata common to all EO Products 
derived from radar altimeter based remote sensing. It describes the same fields as the 
“eop” schema plus altimetry specific fields. 
 
As described in §7.4.2.1, the root element of the “alt” schema, named <alt:EarthObservation> 
simply extends the <eop:EarthObservationType> type (with no element added) : 

  <xs:element name="EarthObservation" type="alt:EarthObservationType"

Annex C 
(informative) 

  
Background to Standardisation of EO product metadata 

This annex contains background information related to the development of this 
specification. It explains the past approach based on gml:observations and the evolution 
to Observations and Measurements.  

Past approach 

In the frame of the initial Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility -Interoperability (HMA-
I) project, ESA together with other GMES participating agencies as ASI, CNES, CSA-
MDA, and DLR decided to model the metadata of Earth Observation products as 
geographic features encoded in the OGC Geographic Markup Language.   

The reasoning for adopting gml instead of a more traditional approach using the 
ISO19115 Geographic Information Metadata model was the fact that the ISO 19115 
elements are more suited for describing the metadata of collections of EO Products rather 
than for describing individual EO products themselves:   

 Typical mandatory ISO 19115 metadata elements like contactInformation 
(gmd:Contact), citation and abstract (MD_dataIdentication) constitute information 
that will be identical for each individual product in the collection.  It does not 
make a lot of sense to repeat these elements in every product metadata record. 
The complexity of the overall ISO19115 model with deep nesting of elements 
leads to a less efficient data structure for web access. 

 On the other hand specific metadata elements like for instance cloud cover are 
required to allow for efficient discovery of EO products.  In case ISO19115 would 
have been selected, such elements would have needed to be added to a non-
comprehensive profile extension of ISO19115 which would anyway have been 
specific to the HMA community.   

Instead of choosing this clearly sub-optimal ISO19115 approach, it was agreed to model 
EO Product metadata as a geographic feature characterised by a footprint and a set of 
attributes. As the specification document [OGC 06-080r4] states:” From an end user 
point of view, an EO data product can be naturally described by a spatial extent (e.g. the 
geographic footprint of a satellite acquisition) and several attributes describing the 
metadata (e.g. date of acquisition, etc.)”.  The encoding language for describing 
geographic features is the Geography Markup Language as standardised by the OGC and 
further adopted as ISO19136.  

The GML application schema for Earth Observation Products was developed during a 
consensus process in which a mapping was done between metadata elements from the 



OGC 10-157r3

different partners on to a harmonised set of elements.  Where possible, the element names 
were taken from corresponding element names within the ISO19115 [Error! Reference 
source not found.] and ISO19115 Part 2 [Error! Reference source not found.] 
standards.  

The metadata was initially modelled as features (extending <gml:AbstractFeature>) and 
later on refined as gml:observations. 

All metadata elements common to all Earth Observation products were defined within an 
Earth Observation Product (eop) GML application schema (formerly known as hma 
schema).  Specific metadata elements for optical radar and atmospheric products, were 
assigned to three specific application schemas deriving (respectively opt, sar and atm) 
from the base eop schema.  For products of specific missions requiring further metadata 
elements for their descriptions, it is possible to define a specific application schema 
deriving from one of the thematic application schemas.   

 
Evolutions of the Standards baseline 

In the continuation of the Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility (HMA) project, the 
HMA Follow on (HMA-FO) project proposed to extend the EO product metadata to 
address radar altimeter, limb looking and synthesis/systematic products and some minor 
improvements to the base schema. 

Besides the schema extensions for the new product types, it is beneficial to evaluate the 
underlying standards baseline.   

Adoption of GML 3.2.1 

Since the initial work on the GML Application Schema for EO Products in 2006, the base 
GML 3.1.1 specification of which [OGC 06-080r4] is an application schema has been 
superseded by a newer version.  GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] is now the official OGC GML 
Implementation Specification since July 2007.  It was therefore logical to align this new 
version of the specification with GML 3.2.1 which is also used within O&M and WCS 
2.0. 
 

Observations and Measurements 

Over almost ten years, OGC has been developing a richer conceptual model for 
observations and measurements within the ISO standard 19156 “Geographic Information 
– Observations and Measurements” [OGC 10-004r1]. 

In view of this the existing gml:Observation will be deprecated and replaced by the ISO 
model. 

The differences between the two models are not major, with the ISO model adding the 
following mandatory properties to the GML model: 



OGC 10-157r3

 the observed property 

 the result time (which in general may be different to the phenomenonTime) 
 
To adopt the standard OM_Observation (ISO 19156), minimal refactoring is required by 
replacing the GML observation properties with their equivalent.

Annex D 
(informative) 

  
Model Driven Approach 

It was proposed, for extending the ‘GML Application Schema for EO Products’ to adopt 
the model-driven approach of ISO TC211, illustrated in Figure 4 below. 

In this approach, a universe of discourse is modelled formally as a conceptual model in a 
UML application schema using the General Feature Model of ISO 19109 [Error! 
Reference source not found.]. Feature types may be registered in a feature catalogue 
specified within ISO 19110 [Error! Reference source not found.] for re-use (e.g. as part 
of other application schemas, through association or generalisation), thus aiding 
interoperability.  

From the UML model, a canonical XML encoding may be generated automatically, 
providing a GML application schema as per OGC 07-036/ISO 19136 [OGC 07-036]. 
Exchange datasets containing feature instances may then be transformed from existing 
(legacy) database or other storage into an XML document conforming to the GML 
application schema.  

Usually these GML instances are accessed through a Web Feature Service as specified in 
ISO 19142 [Error! Reference source not found.].  

In the case of the ‘GML Application Schema for EO Products’, the GML dataset contains 
product-level metadata and is instead accessed through the CSW ebRIM profile (Error! 
Reference source not found.) using the EO Products ebRIM Extension Package (Error! 
Reference source not found.).

Figure 4: Model-driven approach of ISO TC211 

The term ‘model-driven’ refers to the fact that the primary artefact is the UML 
conceptual model – the GML application schema (and other artefacts, e.g. model 
documentation) are generated automatically from the UML model.  

The motivation for a model-driven approach follows naturally from the theoretical 
principles underlying the conceptual modelling framework adopted by ISO TC211, the 
Conceptual Schema Modelling Facilities (CSMF) [Error! Reference source not 
found.].  

Without dwelling on the details of this, CSMF defines a number of important principles 
for conceptual modelling. Chief among them are: 

 the “100% principle”: everything significant in the universe of discourse should 
be described in the conceptual model 

 the “conceptualisation principle”: the conceptual model should contain only 
aspects of the universe of discourse (it should not include aspects related to 
implementation details, e.g. data representation or storage) 

 the “Helsinki principle”: any meaningful exchange should follow agreed syntax 
and semantics related to the conceptual model. 

In particular, the Helsinki principle implies a direct relationship between the UML 
conceptual model and the GML application schema, and that the latter should in principle 
be generated from the former.

(informative) 

  
Mission extension : Sentinel-1  

For the Sentinel-1 specific tailoring, the sar metadata format has to be slightly adapted in 
order to cope correctly with the specific needs for the Sentinel-1 mission. The following 
model is a tailored version of the sar metadata able to manage specific Sentinel-1 Earth 
Observation types.  The sen1:EarthObservationType extends the sar:EarthObservationType.   

 

 
Figure 5 : Updated Metadata Report File for Sentinel-1 

The sen1:EarthObservationType provides the description of metadata common to all EO 
Products for the Sentinel-1 mission. It describes the same fields as the generic “sar”

schema (that itself already extends the “eop” schema) and adds specific fields for 
Sentinel-1 products by extending the sar:EarthObservationType type. 
 

Following properties are extended from the eop schema: 
 sen1:resultQuality extends eop:resultQuality (Table 25) 

extended to add Quality Disclaimer information 
 sen1:EarthObservationMetadata extends eop:EarthObservationMetadata (Table 26) 

changed cardinality of the Dataset ID; 
 sen1:EarthObservationResult extends eop:EarthObservationResult (Table 28) 

extended to add Timeliness concepts 
 sen1:Acquisition extends sar:Acquisition (Table 27) 

extended to add specific polarisation information 
 
The following tables report both the extended XML elements and the additional 
constraints/differences between the generic “sar” Metadata definition and the Sentinel-1 
extended attributes.
