Preface 

OGC Web Services (OWS) testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on 
and collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate specifications into OGC's Specification Program, where they are formalized for public 
release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of technology providers work 
together to solve specific geoprocessing interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's 
sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, pilot projects, 
interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - all designed to encourage rapid 
development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards. 

This report summarizes the results of OGC Web Services Initiative, Phase 8 (OWS-8). The content 
of the OWS-8 initiative are organized around the following four threads: 

� Observation Fusion subthreads: OF-Coverages, OF-Tracking 
o OF-Coverages: WCS 2.0 Earth Observation Application Profile, WCPS, Compliance Tests. 
o OF-Tracking: Detection, tracking, and bookmarking of moving objects in video, 

implemented using SWE and other OGC encodings and interfaces.  
� Geosynchronization and Geodata Bulk Transfer (Geosync)  

o Geosynchronization: Web services and client components to support synchronization and 
updates of geospatial data across a hierarchical Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). 

o Geodata Bulk Transfer: The ability to distribute individual data sets and/or collections of 
data sets in a consistent manner offline and over networks. 

� Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI)  
o Semantic Mediation: Advancement of semantic mediation approaches to query and use data 

based on different heterogeneous data models, which are available via OGC WFS. 
o Portrayal: Advancement of the use of style registries and styling services; and advancement 

of the use of KML. 
o Schema: Advancement of UML/OCL for Schema Automation on Domain Models. 

� Aviation  
o AIXM: Maturing the delivery, filtering and update of AIXM 5.1 using WFS-T/FE 

2.0;  continuing the development of reusable tools, benchmarking of compression techniques 
for enhanced performance, advancing styling and portrayal support, and validating the 
emerging metadata and GML profiles.  

o Aviation Architecture: Advancing Event Notification Architecture, including Digital 
NOTAM Events; supporting AIXM Authoritative Data Source requirements; and leveraging 
DataLink concepts and requirements.  

o WXXM and Weather Concepts:  reviewing/validating the WXXM schemas; encoding 
representative 4D/5D weather forecast and radar datasets; supporting on-demand Coordinate

Summary of OGC Web Services Initiative, Phase 8  (OWS-8) 

1 Overview 
The OGC Web Services, Phase 8 (OWS-8) Testbed was an initiative of OGC’s Interoperability Program to 
collaboratively extend and demonstrate OGC’s baseline for geospatial interoperability.  The majority of work for 
OWS-8 was conducted from March to September 2011, with the following outcomes:  

� 43 Software Components (servers, clients and other applications) were implemented and participated in 
interoperability testing. 

� 35 Engineering Reports (ERs) and Change Requests (CRs) to existing OGC standards were written.  The 
OWS-8 ERs were either technical specifications or reports regarding testing and analysis. The OWS-8 CRs 
were recommendations for changes to existing standards, and have been entered into OGC’s public process 
for reporting such requests here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cr  

 The OWS-8 ERs have also been posted to the OGC Standards Program Pending Documents list for 
consideration in the consensus process. The Engineering reports have been approved for public release, 
accessible on the web here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/per  

� 24 Demonstrations of OWS-8 components, many of which were shown during the OWS-8 Technical 
Review meeting held in Boulder Colorado, USA on 22 September 2011.  The demonstrations with a voice-
over explaining the content are being released as multi-media products via the web here: 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/pub/www/ows8/ 

� 40 organizations participated in some aspect of OWS-8.  Roles for organizations in OWS-8 included 
sponsors, participants and architects.  Additionally there were many organizations that were observers of 
OWS-8.

Cross-Community Interoperability Significant Results: 
² Harmonization of heterogeneous geospatial datasets in order to present consistent views of the 

data is possible through the use of Semantic Web technologies. 
² Implemented a prototype “Semantic Mediation Service” that wraps a WFS into a user 

preferred Feature Model. 
² Implemented a knowledge base SPARQL service. 
² Developed Rossetta Mediation Models for mapping between USGS and NGA data models. 
² Identified the need to stand up several new OGC standards working groups to support 

SPARQL, Semantic Mediator Service and Mapping Table generation. 
² An ebRIM Profile of CSW was implemented with interface to a central repository for 

structured portrayal information.  
² A Feature Portrayal Service was successfully implemented as a means to access vector data via 

a Web Feature Service, portray that data based on predefined and stored rules and symbols and 
visualize as through a Web Map Service.  

² A study was conducted on KML ability to support complex rule sets and symbols with the 
following results: 

² Simple portrayal rule sets the approach worked well. 
² Caching of KML regions worked well. 
² Scale information in all portrayal rules is strongly recommended and helps to reduce 

the data load for both server and client. 
² Enhanced the open source ShapeChange UML conversion tool to support automated creation 

of RDF /OWL , Codelists (SKOS), KML (XSLT), GML (XML Schemas), Codelists (GML), 
Constraints (Schematron) 

² It was concluded that Complex Schematron assertions can be derived automatically from 
application schemas in UML to support; XML based on different encoding rules (GML, 
ISO/TS 19139), OCL constraints and from other information in the UML model.

& Schema initialization on WFS, provide capability for field edits and updates to be returned. 

 

OWS-8 WFS/GML/GSS Workflow Diagram: 

 

 
GSS/GML/WFS Sub-thread Significant Results: 

² Performance scalability is achieved by operating the Import/Export utility on the local machine 
unless an efficient network is used. 

² For maximum interoperability, the WFS schemas should conform to GML Simple Features.  
² NGA data is very schema intensive, thought required on mobile GML versions  

² GBT is based on open standards: ZIP, GML, XML-Schema, ISO-19112, OWS Common 
manifest.   

² GBT mechanism can be easily enhanced to support other encodings and schemas (i.e. 
GeoJSON and JSON Schema). 

²  There is a limitation imposed on GBT by the maxFeatures parameter in the WFS GetFeature 
operation.   

² The GBT format is easily extensible in an interoperable manner without breaking existing 
client applications.  

² Two significant Change Requests drafted against Web Feature Service 2.0 to integrate 
GeoSynchronization Service GBT (Create Schema and Drop Feature Type) allows for 
database initialization and field update information

4.5 Observation Fusion - Tracking  

Sponsors: NGA 

 Participants: 4 participant companies and universities 

 Tasks: 
² Provide an archtectual viewpoint / information model for the usage of video moving target 

indicator data (VMTI), ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and tracking information 
(STANAGs 4607, 4609, 4676, MISB EG0903.03) in the context of standardized spatial data 
infrastructures compliant to OGC and ISO standards. 

² Provide traceability from a moving object back to the original base data through the use of a 
“bookmark” concept. 

² Implement OGC services and encodings, extended by the XML-Schema-based 
implementations; allow access to target information data and tracking data based on VMTI, 
GMTI, and STANAG 4676 information. 

² Identify any recommendations for enhancements to OGC, MISB, NATO standards supporting 
tracking architecture.
