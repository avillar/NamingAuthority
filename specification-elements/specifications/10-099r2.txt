Foreword

This document is informative, and does not change the meaning, or interpretation of other normative standards. 

This document provides notes describing the set of revision for the existing OpenGIS Implementation Specification for the Revision Notes for OpenGIS® Implementation Specification: Geography Markup Language (GML) simple features profile v2.0 and does not modify that implementation specification. The current OpenGIS IS that this document provides revision notes for is [OGC 10-100r2].

Introduction

This document defines a revision notes for Revision Notes for OpenGIS® Implementation Specification: Geography Markup Language (GML) simple features profile v2.0. This document was approved by the OGC membership on (to be determined)
. It also was published as OGC 10-100r2 on (to be determined). This document provides the details of those edits and enhancements.

Revision Notes for OpenGIS® Implementation Specification: Geography Markup Language (GML) simple features profile v2.0
1 Scope

OGC 10-100r2 defines a simplified profile of GML 3.2 that supports GML features and a limited set of linearly interpolated geometric types. A set of application schema encoding rules is defined that allow features to be encoded using GML application schemas.

In particular, OGC 10-100r2 defines:

a) Rigid coding patterns for the use of a subset of XML Schema constructs (XML Schema profile)

b) Rigid coding patterns for the use of a subset of GML constructs (GML profile)

OGC 10-100r2 prescribes the encoding of GML application schemas in sufficient detail that client applications do not need to deal with the entire scope of XML-Schema and GML but only need to understand a restricted subset of both specifications in order to be able interpret schema documents referenced by data encoded in GML. It is expected that making it easier to interpret GML application schemas will enhance interoperability between clients and servers and make the task of implementing client applications less onerous.

OGC 10-100r2 specifies three compliance levels for this profile. Level 0 compliance is the simplest and easiest to understand, but does not support the entire set of GML features or the Simple Feature Common Architecture. Level 1 compliance is somewhat more complex and difficult to understand, but includes more feature encoding abilities sometimes needed. The “full” (level 2) compliance is the most complex, and is intended to include all the feature encoding abilities provided by the OpenGIS® Simple Features access - Part 1: Common architecture.

OGC 10-100r2 is applicable to any client wishing to interpret GML application schema documents in an ad hoc manner in order to interact with data encoded in GML. That is, this document is not meant to address the case where a community of interest has defined a standard GML application schema or set of schemas for exchanging geographic data, but rather the case where a client interacts with a previously unknown server offering data encoded in GML using a previously unknown GML application schema.

OGC 10-100r2 does not address the semantic issues associated with interpreting a previously unknown GML application schema. Instead this document tries to simplify the processing required to determine which feature types a service offers, as well as the structure of those feature types (in terms of property names and data types).

2 Normative references

The following is a list of normative document references that have been added in the new version of this specification:

· OGC 06-103r3, OpenGIS Implementation Specification for Geographic information – Simple feature acces – Part 1: Common architecture
The following is a list of normative document references that have been updated to newer version for the new version of this specification:

· OGC 07-036, OpenGIS® Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard, version 3.2.1

· W3C XML-0, Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition), W3C Recommendation, 26 November 2008, http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml
The following is a list of normative document references that have been removed for the new version of this specification:

· OGC 04-094, OpenGIS Web Feature Service Implementation Specification version 1.1

· OGC 05-008, OGC Web Service Common Specification version 1.0

· OGC 05-099r1, GML 3.1.1 simple dictionary profile, version 1.0

3 Terms and definitions

The terms and definitions of the new version of the specification have been completely revised and aligned with existing terminology, in particular with the terminology defined in the ISO 19100 series of International Standards.

4 Changes and enhancements

4.1 Update to version 3.2 (multiple places)

OGC 06-049r1 was updated to use GML 3.2 [OGC 07-036].  The changes include

1. Updating the GML namespace to be http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2
2. Updating the profile namespace to http://www.opengis.net/gmlsf/2.0
3. Update all gml.xsd references to point to: http://schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/gml.xsd
4. Update the feature collection schema pattern to conform to GML 3.2 (see OGC 10-100r2, 8.4.2).

5. Update the substitution group for features to gml:AbstractFeature.

4.2 Null value handling (see OGC 10-100r2, 8.4.4.4 and 9.2.5)

Null handling remains unchanged for compliance level SF-0. However, compliance level SF-1 has been updated to allow the use of the nillable attribute is application schemas and the xsi:nil attribute in instance documents.

4.3 Internationalized string support (see OGC 10-100r2, 8.4.4.7.2)

A new type has been defined to support internationalized strings by extending the XML base type xsd:string to add the xml:lang attribute.  This allows strings to be tagged with language information.

4.4 User defined types using choice group (see OGC 10-100r2, 9.3.3)

In addition to the xsd:sequence model group, used defined types can now be defined, in compliance level SF-1, that use the xsd:choice model group.

5 Future work

The following information is also included in 10-100r2 in the “Future work” section.

10-100r2 is a straightforward update of the previous version of the GML simple feature profile to another version of GML.

There are a number of open issues that need to be addressed in a future revision. This work needs to be undertaken in a new SWG to be initiated after adoption of this document. The scope of the SWG will include:

· Harmonisation with the OGC Simple Feature Common Architecture standard (revision in process in another SWG)

· Modularisation of the documents (including identifying dependencies to conformance classes of GML and Simple Feature Common Architecture)

· Adaptations to support new versions of GML

A particular item of discussion is the use of the term “simple feature profile” in conjunction with the levels SF-0 and SF-1 as they include restrictions on non-geometric feature properties that are not part of the Simple Feature Common Architecture standard.
