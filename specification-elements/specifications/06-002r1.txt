v. Future Work 

The work reported in this document is a preliminary effort to extend existing OGC 
services, encodings, and architectures with Semantic Web technologies. Almost all 
results, therefore, are preliminary products that will benefit from further development, 
testing, piloting, and deployment. In particular, it is envisioned that ontologies refined 
from this work, as well as service profiles will be the subject of future OGC public 
documents and OGC compliant implementations.

OGC 06-002R1 

Introduction 

The GSW Interoperability Experiment brought together a number of threads in semantics, 
Web technology, and geospatial reasoning. Participation in the experiment was solicited 
both from a wide spectrum of OGC members, and from other relevant organizations such 
as W3C, universities, and commercial semantic research groups.  

The principal areas of compilation, problem solving, and implementation for this 
experiment were: 

 Development of geospatial, domain, and other ontologies covering the knowledge 
and operations domains of the demonstration use case 

 Development of a reference Web architecture for exchanging information with 
formal semantics and processing information queries. 

 Choice and refinement of one or more query languages and predicates for 
expressing geospatial queries. 

 Development of interfaces and profiles that support the interaction of components 
in the Web architecture and can be used to extend existing OGC Web Services 
components. 

 Implementation of components and information stores sufficient to carry out the 
experimental demonstration. 

An important challenge for this experiment and for follow-on work has involved bridging 
a gap between the technology of distributed computing and the technology of semantic 
processing. The initial architecture for this work emphasized the discovery and 
consumption of distributed geospatial services to gather together semantic artifacts for 
reasoning within an application. Later versions will begin to explore the distribution of 
machine reasoning and semantic processing among remote service components, as 
ongoing work here and elsewhere makes this feasible.

2 Relationship to Other Activities 

The GSW.IE sought particularly to make connections between two lines of OGC activity: 

• Geospatial encodings, service specifications and architectures which are potentially applicable 
to a broad spectrum of geospatial data and applications; 

• Restriction to particular profiles and vocabularies for those specifications in order to make 
them meaningful and implementable within a particular information community.  

More specifically, the experiment addressed the use of the Web Feature Service and Catalogue Service 
/ Web service specifications, as well as the GML and Filter Encoding specifications. Information 
communities considered included geospatial intelligence and aeronautical navigation. 

3 Problem Statement 

This interoperability experiment addressed several important steps towards the development of a 
Geospatial Semantic Web (GSW), where discovery, query, and consumption of geospatial content are 
based on formal semantic specification.  

What problem in general does the Geospatial Semantic Web solve? The World Wide Web has made a 
world of online content globally accessible with one mouse click. The Geospatial Web has extended 
this capability to an immense variety of geospatial information and concepts. The farther that 
information and services travel from their origin, though, the less likely that remote users will also 
have access to the local context in which to find, evaluate, and interpret such resources. The success of 
syntactically interoperable Web services connections has created significant semantic gaps in what can 
be utilized. Both users and their client software may lack the tools to work with the diverse information 
which Geospatial Web standards have made nominally obtainable.  

The Semantic Web seeks to make the meaning as accessible as the material, by enabling connections– 
which are both logical and (machine) actionable–between concepts which a user presently understands 
and those which may be new and foreign. The Geospatial Semantic Web extends this capability to both 
content and concepts that are specifically spatial, temporal, and geographic in nature, giving both 
people and machines true access to a wider range of knowledge. 

Many pieces of the GSW puzzle have already been worked extensively in the last several years. Our 
experiment sought specifically to test the extension and implementation of WFS /FE services where 
these elements may be assembled to implement a distributed end-to-end geospatial query/discovery use 
case. Significant elements of this experiment have included: 

• Development / encoding of formal and connected geospatial ontologies, including feature type 
descriptions; 

• Geospatial service interfaces which can provide service information formulated in the OWL-S  
semantic expression language referencing those ontologies; 

• Geospatial service interfaces which can operate on requests for ontologically expressed service 
and content descriptions; 



OGC 06-002R1 

10 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

• Semantic query language processing interfaces for WFS /FE or other services which operate on 
combinations of the above ontologies, service information and queries; 

• Processes for discovering semantically expressed geospatial information and services; 
• Implemented WFS / FE and other components for use in processing geospatial queries 

Two test demonstrations were developed by the GSW IE participants of an end-to-end semantic 
geospatial query case, where WFS /FE data and services relevant to the query are discovered through 
knowledgebase reasoning. Parts of this report include material for developing new semantic profiles of 
the WFS / FE and CS/W specifications which reflect the results of the experiment. This is a small but 
significant contribution to advancement of the Geospatial Semantic Web. 

3.1 Use Case 

The specific query we set out to answer in this experiment was: 

“Which airports in a specified area of the world are capable of receiving a C-5 cargo plane?” 

Given a user able to construct such a query, a known information service with known request syntax 
and data that directly answers this question, the query is of course trivial. In our specific use case, the 
user may be familiar with the general concepts of the query, but not know the specific terms to use in a 
successful query. The specific services with relevant information may not be known in advance, and 
there may not be an existing dataset attribute which explicitly indicates which airports have the 
specific capability requested.  

In the real world of the present, such a user would typically hunt around for information sounding 
syntactically familiar, then turn to searching for other people to help her with unfamiliar datasets and 
terminology, to whom she would laboriously explain the query, searching for terms familiar to both of 
them. 

Our plan was to develop semantic forms of the critical information for this search process, including 
Web Feature Service information, GML Feature Schemas, and Spatial / Non-spatial Filter Encodings 
using OWL / OWL-S.   This information could then be used with semantic processing technologies to 
implement the above query use case in a distributed computing scenario. 

3.2 Semantic Interoperability 

There is no general agreement on what exactly constitutes semantic interoperability, although lack of it 
it is commonly held to be a problem. Some elements of semantic interoperability include: 

• Top of the interoperability stack for distributed computing 

• Shared concepts 

• Formal, common knowledge representation, usually in graph form, generically termed 
“ontologies” 

• Actionable (i.e. machine-process-able) relationships between similar / connected concepts 
using inference, reasoning, pattern matching, rule processing, etc. 

• Shared models for distributed processes, such as interface contracts and virtual machines.   



OGC 06-002R1 

 

3.3 Semantic processing roles in a distributed computing architecture 

The GSW.IE was specifically interested in the application of semantic technology to OWS service 
architectures. In this type of environment as illustrated in Figure 1, roles for semantic processing 
include: 

• Cross-domain resource discovery: Services are published through a well-known trader.  A 
client discovers relevant served resources through the trader, which tells it how to bind to the 
server. In the case where the published resources are represented in a different vocabulary or 
knowledge domain from that of the client user, semantic processing enables such heterogenous 
resources to be discovered  where text search alone is not sufficient. 

• Heterogeneous resource query:Clients bind to and query services for relevant resources. 
Semantic query establishes connections from the query knowledge domain to multiple 
heterogeneous resource domains across multiple heterogeneous service interfaces. 

• Resource translation from one domain to another: Basic publish-find-bind architectures 
provide for discovery and retrieval of distributed resources. For actual utilization of 
heterogeneous resources, those resources may require an additional step of translation through 
a broker function from their native knowledge domain into a knowledge domain accessible to 
the retrieving client and user.

Each of the interactions shown may potentially be enhanced with formal semantics and semantic 
processing. 

 

4 Experiment Design and Activities 

4.1 Overview 

The GSW.IE addressed some of the following experiments around the use of a semantically enabled 
Geospatial Web: 

• Experiment #1: Construct a feature dataset ontology using OWL in order to describe 5-6 
sample feature collections relevant to the GEOINT use case.  

• Experiment #2: Construct an OWS service description ontology using OWL-S in order to 
describe WFS services.  

• Experiment #3: Translate realistic GEOINT request (see the Use Case above) into a semantic 
query language encoding and GEOINT query domain ontology.  

• Experiment #4: Perform an end-to-end geospatial semantic query in a non-distributed 
environment using the results of Experiment #1 - Experiment #3; the result of this query 
process will be WFS service requests for information which satisfy the query.  

• Experiment #5: Implement and test an OWS capabilities type and/or interface which returns 
service / content descriptions such as in Experiment #1 and Experiment #2 from WFS service 
instances.  

• Experiment #6: Perform an end-to-end geospatial semantic query as in Experiment #4 but 
involving remote requests for metadata as in Experiment #5.  

The goal of this sequence of experiments was a step-wise increase in the complexity of the 
architecture being tested, beginning with a largely centralized use of ontologies and knowledge 
bases, proceeding to more distributed forms of processing. 
 

4.2 Multiple ontology development 

An essential part of the experimental design involved use of multiple ontologies representing domains 
of knowledge or communities of information which remain separate but which may be linked and 
traversed by the geo-semantic query process. Figure 3 shows the conceptual layout of ontology “types” 
which were defined and developed during the experiment.

Figure 3. Conceptual design of multiple ontologies relevant to the experiment use case, showing their 
relationship to one another and to the semantic query process. 

Just as the communities they represent remain separate but overlapping, so these ontologies are 
expected to maintain separate identities but be linked (e.g. via subsumption or mapping) into a 
knowledgebase (either physical or virtual) capable of providing answers to cross-domain queries. 

Domain ontologies 

Any ontology representing specialized knowledge may be termed a domain ontology. We make a 
practical distinction here between two types of GSW domain ontologies 

Problem ontology – ontology for a domain in which questions are asked or applications are created, 
also termed query, application, or public ontology.In Figure 3, this type of ontology is represented by 
the GeoIntel ontology. 

Feature ontology – ontology for a domain in which source geoinformation exists, also termed data, 
source, or private ontology.In Figure 3, this type is represented by multiple aero feature ontologies 

 Upper versus base ontologies 

Base Ontology - A commonly used and possibly standardized ontology to represent a particular 
domain or area which is of general interest. An example of this would be a particular standard 
vocabulary, such as for units of measure 

Upper Ontology - An ontology designed to link other ontologies by providing a more abstract 
definition of concepts that appear in the other ontologies. This creates a tree in which other ontology 
concepts become subconcepts of the elements of the upper ontology. Concepts such as Feature or 
SpatiallyRelated might belong to an upper ontology.

These two types of ontologies are not mutually exclusive. A particular ontology may have greater or 
lesser characteristics of each type. However, they both tend to be ways that ontologies are linked to 
one another, and there are times when it makes sense to choose between the two approaches. Upper 
ontologies tend to represent the universe at the most abstract level; They tend to be broad, but may not 



OGC 06-002R1 

14 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

be deep enough to meet the needs of an application, and it can be hard to come to agreement about 
what should or should not be in them. This is not to say that it is easy to come to consensus about how 
to represent things within one specific domain (geospatial data, for example), just that there could be a 
higher probability of success here. 

The use of common base ontologies makes software specialization significantly less challenging. If 
there were a standard base geospatial ontology that defined representations for geometries, mapping 
software could make use of data from any ontology as long as it linked to the base geospatial ontology 
for describing its geometries. The Friend of a Friend (FOAF), contact information ontology is another 
example of this. Software designed to seek out contact information could handle data represented 
primarily in any ontology if it referenced foaf where appropriate. None of this is to say that we exclude 
the use of upper ontologies, but we tend to use them for different purposes. For example, Classification 
Upper Ontologies are particularly useful for human understanding of the meaning of an ontology. 

Ontology Language 

For a number of reasons, including experience of the participants, availability of software tools, and 
affinity for use in distributed systems, ontologies were represented for the purpose of the experiment in 
the RDF and RDFS offshoot OWL DL (i.e. OWL builds on RDF and is represented in it). Other 
information elements were also represented in RDF, such as rules (SWRL). 

There are choices as well of languages to be used for querying ontologies. The focus of the IE was the 
use of SeRQL since it is currently supported by the SESAME platform, but preliminary use was also 
made of SPARQL, an emerging W3C standard which is similar to SeRQL. 

4.3 Information sets 

While a distributed computing investigation must operate on a number of levels, the ultimate object of 
this activity is clearly information interoperability. A number of the types and sets of information 
which were created and/or operated upon in the GSW IE are described below. 

4.3.1 OWL and Ontologies 

An ontology is itself a conceptual entity which may be carried in any number of expressions (e.g. 
vocabularies) and encodings (e.g. textual forms). Given experimental priorities of available software 
technology and applicability to Web / distributed computing paradigms, OWL DL [OWL] was chosen 
as the most appropriate language for expressing ontologies created and/or utilized in the experiment, 
encoded generally in the form of RDF XML for portability. 

OWL DL alone proved not to be sufficiently expressive for some of the geospatial and cross-domain 
knowledge needed to process the experimental query efficiently.  Additional processing rules were 
therefore devised by the participants to fill this gap. In the case of the BBN semantic middleware, rules 
were added to the BBN knowledgebase by making use of the developing SWRL specification. SWRL 
combines OWL with a means of expressing logical evaluation rules. A sample rule and matching 
expression are shown below:

4.3.1.1 Feature representation 

There are a number of knowledge representation issues which were dealt with during the course of this 
experiment in order to construct feature domain ontologies which are both accurate and useful. Issues 
are described here under two main headings. 



OGC 06-002R1 

Representing the representation 

Ontologies are normally used to represent what is known about a real domain and are most useful 
when such a direct representation is asserted. Representing geographic knowledge is complicated by 
the fact that this knowledge already has a level of geometric indirection, as geographic features are 
represented inexactly by geometric entities such as points, lines, and polygons. The ontologist is then 
faced with a choice whether to derive classes from geographic entities (e.g. “cities”), feature entities 
(“city point features”) or both. The latter is more accessible in terms of geospatial reasoning and query 
(e.g. “within 50 km of city”), but the former is more accessible to reasoning on geopolitical concepts 
(e.g. “neighborhood belongs to city”). 

In order to avoid myriad complications which attend this sort of multiple inheritance, the choice was 
generally made in this experiment to represent geographic entities directly and express feature 
“aspects” of those entities by means of property relationships (e.g. “hasLocation”). This was generally 
an illustration that there are no globally “true” or “correct” answers in ontology development (at least 
accessible to human ontologists), only useful ones for the perceived range of ontology application. 

Shared vocabulary 

There are means to directly and semi-automatically translate many data models, particularly if they are 
expressed in XML Schema or UML, directly into an ontology language such as OWL. Web-accessible 
archives contain many of these generated ontologies. The challenge is that many entity properties from 
these data models end up in the ontology as string or other literal types, which cannot generally be 
compared with each other in order to bridge gaps between disparate ontologies. Experiment 
participants spent some time refining the “working set” ontologies to make greater use of common 
property concepts from “base” ontologies such as one for measurements. This approach, although 
requiring greater upfront effort, generally allows the linking of multiple ontologies into a common 
query / reasoning framework to proceed more smoothly and easily.

4.3.1.2 Multiple distributed feature sources 

In the case of multiple, distributed feature data sources, there is an additional layer of representation, 
both as an (instance) ontology, and as a Web service” represented in this case by an OWL-S 
description.

Query Distribution 

A consequence of working with distributed and heterogeneous information sources is the convolution 
of each single query into a graph of multiple consequent queries as the initiatl query touches concepts 
which are represented in remote stores. The example in Figure 9 shows how the “C5 capable Airport” 
concept  leads to a sequence of queries against multiple datasets representing multiple feature 
ontologies possible offered by multiple services. Each arrow in the diagram may represent multiple 
service queries which determine through description and typing information whether the features in a 
particular dataset are relevant to the initial query. Depending on the scale of a real distributed 
information system and the knowledge about them already held by the query processor, there may be  
tens or hundreds of consequent queries for a single initial query.

4.3.3 OWL-S service information 

A critical element of the use of services in distributed computing environments is the service 
description. Whether such a description is available directly from a service, such as with OWS 
services, or from a 3rd party in the case of most WSDL descriptions, service information is the key both 
to discovering and consuming useful services in any service-oriented architecture. 

Descriptions or “capabilities” for OWS services have generally consisted of custom XML documents 
incorporating some elements of standard metadata for geoinformation. Several efforts have been 
underway to specify more complete and actionable ontology-based descriptions in order to facilitate 
the implementation of “Semantic Web Services”. One effort in particular is OWL-S, which extends 
OWL to represent three aspects of a Web service (or any other service, really): 

• Service profile – thematic information on the type, role, and context of a service 

18 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
• Service grounding – syntactical information for service binding and consumption 



OGC 06-002R1 

• Service process – a conceptual or general model of the process by which a service relates inputs 
to outputs. In contrast to the notion of an opaque interface, it is not really practical to make use 
of a service or build a client for it without some external or public model of what the service 
does. This is the newest and most problematic part of a semantically enabled service 
description. 

 OWL-S also makes use of elements of WSDL [WSDL] in order to describe the syntax of binding to a 
particular service.

Figure n.  Conceptual elements of an OWL-S service description 

In principal, an OWL-S description can be utilized by a generic service client to bind effectively to that 
service, hence the concept of an “OWL-S Virtual Machine” which represents such a distributed service 
as a local process in an environment such as a knowledgebase. This approach is discussed further as an 
aspect of the BBN semantic middleware.

4.3.4 GML features / descriptions 

Several feature datasets were used in the experiment. Three principal datasets served as the material for 
“feature ontologies” The challenge (and opportunity) they posed for semantic discovery and query was 
that each contained partial information in differently named fields about place features relevant to the 
experimental query.

a dashed line were not within the scope of the present work. 

The “Knowledge Server” component is shown only in the most general terms and was implemented in 
more than one way by different GSW.IE participants.  For example, the TASC-BBN component 
fetched feature instances directly while the IfGi client performed this function. 

4.5 Component interfaces 

In order to implement a distributed computing system, it is necessary to define or choose interfaces by 
which the components communicate with each other. The experiment focused on two OGC service 
specifications and two similar “Knowledge Service” query interfaces. Forms of these interfaces were 
then implemented in different component and architectural configurations by the participants. 

 

4.5.1 Web Feature Service (WFS) 

The GSW.IE specifically looked at what it means to “semantically enable” a Web Feature Service. The 
appropriate level of enablement represents a balance between a view of the WFS as a primary source 
of data and the likelihood that the provider of feature data through a WFS is likely the party most 
knowledgeable about the features and most able to describe them fully. Four levels of enablement were 
considered, although not all were implemented in the experiment: 

• WFS service description in OWL-S; this enables semantic discovery of WFS capabilities 
and/or use of OWL/S virtual machines to consume WFS services. 

22 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 



OGC 06-002R1 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

23 

 

• WFS feature type description (e.g. DescribeFeature) in OWL; this is usually a necessary 
enhancement in order for the tightly coupled contents of WFS to be discoverable through 
semantic processing whether by the WFS component or elsewhere. 

• WFS feature instances returned in OWL; this step is not generally strictly necessary in order to 
visualize features, for example, as other representations (e.g. GML) may suffice for this 
purpose; it may be needed, however, in order to perform domain translations or to determine 
whether particular features actually answer a query 

• WFS support for an (additional) OWL / RDF query language such as SPARQL; in this case the 
graph matching, rule processing and other forms of semantic query processing would be 
accomplished behind the WFS service interface.  

These forms of service interface enhancement are not necessarily achieved in an originating server 
component but may represent a proxy, façade, or translation layer somewhere else in the services 
architecture. Similar approaches were implemented during the course of the IE.  

4.5.2 CS/W 

A catalogue or registry interface is a central component feature of any service-oriented architecture. 
The experiment began with considering a catalogue as a means of discovering other semantically 
enhanced services and information. During the course of the experiment it gradually became clear that 
the OGC CS/W service interface could also be enhanced in various ways to provide a connection 
between OGC services and various forms of semantic graph manipulation technology. Several levels 
of semantic enablement were again considered and variously implemented: 

• Existing catalog resources, such as WFS service instances or feature types, which have been 
“decorated” (e.g. as keywords) with searchable semantic concepts such as OWL class 
identifiers. This enables a non-enhanced CS/W client to use the concepts resulting from a 
separate semantic query or knowledgebase operation in a “normal” CS/W query. 

• Addition of semantic catalogue resources, as for example records which represent OWL 
concepts, relationships, or subgraphs. At perhaps the lowest level, individual RDF triples could 
be registered as CS/W catalogue records. It is likely that some hierarchy of record types (e.g. 
triple- subgraph-graph)would prove most useful in this regard (c.f. classification-
classification_node-classification_scheme in the ebRIM profile of CS/W).  

• CS/W enhanced query to support semantic processing; in such a case the discovery-oriented 
aspects of knowledgebase processing and query would be invoked with CS/W operations, 
specifically GetRecord. Such an enhanced interface could be syntactically compliant with the 
CS/W specification, but involve query operators that make use of graph relationships in 
addition to more straightforward textual, spatial, or category matching. 

• CS/W enhancement to support an OWL /  RDF query language such as SPARQL; in this case 
the CS/W interface would be used as a rather thin veneer on a variety of knowledgebase 
processing operations. It is likely that additional operations would be required to support 
actions such as inferencing, in much the same way that non-semantically-enhanced CS/W 



OGC 06-002R1 

24 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

implementations require additional operations if certain distributed catalogue administration 
functions are to be supported. 

• CS/W brokering enhancements for semantic translation; while the OGC Catalogue 2.0 
specification does include conceptual ordering operations, these have not really been explicitly 
defined in either the CS/W protocol or related information profiles. On the other hand, ontology 
languages such as OWL make less of an absolute distinction between resource collections, 
definitions, and individuals than some other information forms, so specific brokering 
operations may not be as important in order for a knowledgebase type of component 
implementing a CS/W interface to provide semantic translation capabilities. 

 

4.5.3 SESAME HTTP 

As part of its API, the SESAME open-source semantic processing framework [SESAME] provides a 
simple HTTP interface [SESAME_HTTP] with operations which allow a Web client to list the 
available graph repositories and execute queries in SeRQL against them. Operations available through 
this interface include: 

• ListRepositories 
• EvaluateTableQuery 
• EvaluateGraphQuery 
• ExtractRDF 
• UploadData 
• UploadURL 
• ClearRepository 
• RemoveStatements 
As can be seen from this list, the SESAME http interface provides some capabilities for information 
about, query of, and transactions on RDF graph stores, but does not provide all the controls on 
semantic processing which are possible within the platform. 

4.5.4 SPARQL 

SPARQL [SPARQL] is a standard semantic query language emerging from the W3C. It is also 
combined with a specification for a relatively simple access protocol with HTTP and SOAP bindings. 
This access protocol has but one interface and one operation: Query. This operation simply provides 
the means of conveying the text of a SPARQL query to a SPARQL query processor and receiving the 
response. All of the information on what the client is actually requesting is contained within the 
SPARQL message itself, and so the interface carries no information / semantics on what is being 
requested, in contrast to other more method-rich interfaces.

4.6.2 NGT feature server

4.7 Experimental scenario 

Since the precise make-up of semantic processing components was itself the subject of investigation in 
this experiment, interoperability between such components was not the principal goal of experimental 
activities. Instead, the experimental scenario involved multiple participant groups (2) beginning with a 
common query, a common set of ontologies, and a common set of feature collections hosted on WFS 
servers. The scenario goal was to successfully process the query given the other common sets of 
information and derive similar result feature sets. Analysis of the experimental results below then 
revealed common patterns in the query processing as subjects for future interoperability work. 

5 Results 

There were a number of results from this experiment. They include: 

• A record of 6 months of deliberation and development in the GSW IE wiki 
(http://portal.opengeospatial.org/wiki/twiki/bin/view/GSWie/WebHome),  

• Two test deployments of query-processing software (BBN/TASC and IfGi), 

• Initial development of several geospatial ontologies, 

• An initial semantic query architecture, 

• Concepts for profiles of WFS and CS/W specifications 

Some of these results are further discussed below.

5.1.2 IfGi 

The demonstrated IfGi query sequence consists of the following steps: 

1. Select domain of interest. In the first step the user has to select one or more domains of 
interest, i.e. he chooses the domain vocabulary he needs for formulating a query. 

2. Select concept and properties. In the second step, the user selects the concept and properties 
that he is interested in. In our example, the user wants to know the name of an airport. 

3. Define constraints. In the third step, the user defines the constraint the requested airport should 
meet. This is the most complex task during the process of query formulation. Finally the user 
has created a query for an airport that has a runway, which length is greater than 2000m. In the 
following steps, this query is used for both, the discovery of suitable WFS for providing this 
kind of information and for the retrieval of the actual feature from the WFS. 

4. Generate logic statement for semantic matchmaking. For the task of discovering a suitable 
WFS, we want to take advantage of logical reasoning services that enable an automated 
matchmaking. Thus, we first have to translate the query statement displayed in step 4 into a 
logic statement. 

5. Submit semantic query for discovery. In step 5 the results of the semantic matchmaking are 
displayed. The reasoning service has calculated that the QUERY concept is a subclass of the 
DafifAirport? concept defined in dafif.owl. (dafif.owl describes the runway and airport feature 
types offered by the DAFIF WFS). Consequently, the DAFIF WFS has been identified as a 
semantic match for the query and can now be selected by the user to be used for retrieving the 
requested information. 

6. Generate & submit WFS request for retrieval. In the 6th step the GetFeature request has 
been generated based on the query statement from step 4. This also requires the translation 
from the ontological vocabulary used in Dafif.owl into the terms used in the GML schema of 
the DAFIF WFS. By submitting the WFS request the results can be displayed immediately. 

The example has been simplified by basing the query formulation on measurements.owl and 
airports.owl only. This hopefuly provides enough insight for illustrating the principle behind the 
approach. However, an example of how the entire query would look like for the Airport/Runaway use 
case is provided in the queries.owl file 

 

5.2 Architectural Model 

Even given the fairly well defined and developed OWS geospatial services architecture, the topic of an 
architectural model for geosemantic services was perhaps the most vigorously debated area of the 
entire experiment. This vigor illustrates above all the ubiquitous potential applicability of semantic 
technology and representations. There were so many different ways in which processing steps could be 
distributed and so many different points at which transformations to/from semantic representations of 



OGC 06-002R1 

information could prove useful, that there was plenty of room for individual preferences, available 
technical capabilities, and nuance of requirements. 

The more persistent possibilities have been more-or-less combined and summarized in the semantic 
query stack described below. This stack defines a set of (almost) atomic processing steps which can be 
implemented in several varieties of distributed components (two of which were demonstrated in the 
experiment). Standard interfaces could be defined between any two of these processing steps, although 
it is likely that future development will identify a limited number of discrete components which will be 
of interest for widespread deployment. The generalized elements and their functions are summarized in 
Figure 10. 

The processing sequences for some of the use cases implemented or contemplated in the experiment 
are shown in Figure 11. and discussed further below. Element Function

1. User Interface - the application interface for the user 

2. Template catalog - service for discovery & retrieval of query template ontologies for user 
interface configuration 

3. Domain catalog - service for discovery & retrieval of domain ontologies familiar to the user 
with which construct queries. 

4. Query processor - service to process queries (either in DoQuery? or GetRecord? requests, by 
performing reasoning and other operations on a knowledgebase. 

5. Virtual K(nowledge)-base - knowledgebase service which represents and accesses remote 
knowledge as needed to support query processing in the knowledgebase.

6. OWS CSW - Service to harvest and catalog remote OWS services and contents (e.g. WFS and 
features. 

7. S-OWS - service which represents an OWS service (e.g. WFS) but is able to respond to requests 
with responses in a semantic format (e.g. OWL feature ontology and/or OWLS-S description). 

8. OWS - normal OGC Web service such as a WFS. 

 

5.2.1.2 Operation Sequences 

1. Discover and retrieve a query template ontology to implement in the client 

2. Discover and retrieve domain ontology (or ontologies) which are used to "fill in the blanks" in 
the query 

3. Issue query (shown here as a SPARQL-like DoQuery? request) against a fixed knowledgebase 
component 

4. Issue query (either DoQuery? or csw:GetRecord) against a virtual knowledgebase which 
incorporates both feature and service ontologies as needed from remote OWS services (WFS +/- 
CSW here) with harvesting and translation of both GetCapabilities? and DescribeFeature?. 

5. Issue GetRecord? request for (concept-annotated) feature and service records in an otherwise 
"normal" CSW Catalog. 

6. Issue a DoQuery? request against a virtual knowledgebase which in term fetches - translates - 
returns matching feature individuals from matching remote WFS's. 

7. Issue GetRecord? request against remote WFS and return GML 

5.2.1.3 Distributed Components 

Shown here are three possible componentizations and corresponding knowledge components which are 
processed by them. The pattern of semantic technologies as catalog-like mediation services between 
user-centered client applications and specialized remote resources should be clear. 

1. Ifgi thick knowledge client -> Concept-decorated Service Catalog -> Web Feature Service(s) 

2. Thin client -> query/domain/virtualK-base catalog(s) -> Semantic Web Feature Service(s) (WFS 
or WFS facade(s) returning OWL). 

3. TASC thick client -> BBN GeoSESAME middleware / catalog (Sesame + SAIL's) -> Web 
Feature Service(s) 

Query and domain (c.f. public) ontologies on the user (left) side are mapped / overlapped using a 
knowledgebase "mapping" or "base" ontology to feature and OWS service (c.f. private) ontologies on 
the resource (right) side.

5.2.2 Further observations on GSW architecture 

TBD 

5.3 WFS Profile 

As discussed in Clause 3.5.1, there are a number of ways in which a semantic profile of WFS can be 
defined and implemented. Semantic enablement of WFS in this experiment was only accomplished 
implicitly, through façade or proxy elements in the semantic middleware components deployed by the 
participants, for example the GeoSAIL and OWL-S VM elements in GeoSESAME, or the concept-
decorated service information in the IfGi catalog component. Nevertheless, the experiment has 
provided some insight into issues involved in selecting and refining future semantic WFS profiles. 

5.3.1 Type I and type II profiles 

Specification profiles in general are usually distinguished as Type I (only restrictive) where the 
information and/or operations are restricted from their nominally specified domains, or as Type II 
(restrictive and additive) where additional options, elements, or operations may be used to expand the 
nominal specification. 

Almost all of the considered WFS profiles fall within the Type II category since they include 
additional options, formats, and/or operations. The exception may only be a compatibility profile in 
which the nominal capabilities, feature schemas, and GML features are restricted for maximal ease of 
translation to semantic representations such as OWL.  

5.3.2 Levels of generalization 

An important principle of distributed computing is that of appropriate generalization or level of detail. 
In other words, don’t pull a gigabyte of features over the network to assess whether they meet a local 
need when the same can be done with 100 bytes of descriptive metadata. In the semantic processing 
realm, the same could be termed “Just-in Time Knowledge”. Any useful semantic profile of WFS must 
be able to supply economical levels of detail – just enough content for query processing or inference to 
continue, but not more. This can present an interesting problem of matching the operations and formats 
of existing WFS’ (i.e. GetCapabilities -> GetFeatureInfo -> GetFeature) to the almost stepless degrees 
of specificity which are possible in OWL and other processable graph-type knowledge representations. 

5.3.3 Where to put the knowledge 

Work in the experiment with semantically represented features and metadata has demonstrated the 
value of a proxy or façade approach to semantic enablement. In other words, existing feature service 
instances and their feature collections can be fronted by components which represent themselves as 
enhanced services and perform whatever processing and translation is required to interact successfully 
with the original WFS. The advantage of this approach is that it enables separation between the 
provision of features (the original WFS) and the provision of semantic technology (e.g. the OWL-



OGC 06-002R1 

36 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

aware or SPARQL-aware proxy). A disadvantage from the point of view of knowledge management, is 
that the original WFS may not be able to convey enough information to the proxy for generating an 
accurate knowledge representation, yet the needed human domain expertise is probably back with the 
providers of the original WFS. The technical concerns do not (necessarily) separate along the same 
lines as the domain concerns. This problem manifests itself both in the GML / OWS translator of the 
GeoSESAME platform and in the IfGi Concept-decorated Catalog. 

The conclusion here is that there is probably no one semantic WFS profile (either integral or proxied) 
which suits all use cases. It will probably be important to define and implement 3-4 profile levels in 
order to meet the needs of real distributed geosemantic systems. 

5.3.4 Case for semantic query language capability in a WFS 

Suppose a WFS has a feature that it represents in GML like this: 

<city fid="1"> 
   <name>Metropolis</name> 
   <size>100000</size> 
   <area>60</area> 
   <geometry> 
      <point> 
         <x>-100</x> 
         <y>50</y> 
      </point> 
   </geometry> 
</city> 
 

It may be important to redefine this semantically in OWL to take advantage of some standard semantic 
definitions. Something like this: 

<city rdf:ID="city1"> 
   <name>Metropolis</name> 
   <std1:population>100000</std1:population> 
   <std2:area> 
      <std2:units>sqkm</std2:units> 
      <std2:value>60</std2:value> 
   </std2:area> 
   <geometry> 
      <point> 
         <x>-100</x> 
         <y>50</y> 
      </point> 
   </geometry> 
</city> 
 

Now suppose a client draws all the cities in a particular area. It “understands” this semantic definition 
of population and wants to use it to determine how large a dot to draw on the map. All is well and 
good. It can do a GetFeature request using the BBOX operator in a standard OGC filter, and get the 
features back in the OWL it understands how to draw.

But suppose the client also wants to only retreive cities with a population greater than 10000. The 
client would be stuck because it has no way of knowing that the "size" GML property is the same thing 
as the "std1:population" OWL property, so it can't construct the appropriate OGC Filter. 

So to avoid situations like this, I think it is necessary that the constraint language can use the OWL 
definitions directly. A standard semantic query language like SPARQL seems like it would be the best 
solution. 

5.4 CS/W Profile 

The concept of a specification profile is defined in ISO 19106, but the basic idea is to follow a set of 
rules for specializing, extending, and / or restricting an existing specification or protocol. In the case of 
the OGC Catalog 2.0 specification, there is a fairly well defined layering. 

• Base specification defines conceptual operations, the basic (record) information model, and a 
core set of queryable properties, mainly from Dublin Core. 

• A protocol layer defined how the conceptual operations may be implemented. There is an 
HTTP (called Catalog Services / Web or CS/W) and a CORBA profile defined in the base 
specification document. 

• An information profile then defines more specifically the information model (record definitions 
and relationships) with which a catalog will be concerned. Examples of these include FGDC or 
ISO 19115/19119 profiles. 

An information profile generally includes: 

• Definitions of record types for catalog holdings - recordtypes 

• Properties which can be queried to discover holdings (e.g. Dublin Core +) and their 
relationships to the recordtypes. 

• Result models (e.g. element sets) and formats (e.g. XML) which can be requested from the 
catalog. 

• One or more query languages (e.g. Common Query Language +) which can be used to define 
holdings of interest. 

• Definitions of sources of information from which to build holdings - e.g. service capabilities 

The ebRIM profile of CS/W is a little different because it defines not a model of the specific content to 
be catalogued, but a catalog management information model which can be used to catalog a variety of 
information resources. The ebRIM model explicitly accounts for common catalog information which 
allows resources to be discovered and retrieved. By pulling the information relevant to discovery out of 
the resource itself, an ebRIM-based catalog is not dependent on being able to reach "into" the resource 
format itself. ebRIM objects include: 

• Catalogued resource - "extrinsicObject" 



OGC 06-002R1 

38 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

• Queryable properties - "slots" 

• Resource relationships - "associations" 

• Resource classifications - "classifications - classification nodes - classification schemes" 

The concept of the ebRIM management model is important to semantic catalogs because it specifically 
enables access to content by defining how a resource may be discovered (e.g. slots, associations, 
classifications) separately from the discoverable resource itself. The added-value discovery 
information need not come from the resource itself or even the community which provides the 
resource. A classification particularly may characterize a resource in a completely different way than 
that resource is described by its own "community". 

This leaves us some challenges in defining a "Semantic CS/W Profile" 

• Reconcile the records-oriented base CS/W model with semantic graph objects such as OWL 
ontologies. 

• Define (separately) the information model of registered resources and the information model of 
additional knowledge which adds value to the discovery process. 

In general, the catalog role of separating and connecting the resources to be discovered from the 
information used for discovering them, fits well with our semantic middleware role of reasoning from 
query domains to data domains. 

5.4.1 Semantic registry information model 

This RIM attempts to reconcile the records-oriented base CS/W model with the semantic graph model 
by modeling each node and each relationship in the graph as a separate OWL Entity record.  The 
"usedBy" and "impliedBy" relations are intended to link the OWL entity definitions to potential 
sources of instance data.  For instance, if you have a WFS serving airports, you would have a Dataset 
record for the airport featuretype.  You might also have OWLEntity records for an Airport class, a 
locatedAt property, and a Location class, etc.  All of these OWLEntity records would use the usedBy 
relation to point back to the Dataset record.  This would support both type reasoning and instance 
reasoning. 

 



OGC 06-002R1 

Figure 13. Object model for proposed semantic catalog information model 

Type reasoning: 

User starts by searching OWLEntity classes by keyword "airport", which turns up the Airport class 
record.  The user traces the usedBy relationship back to the airport Dataset record to find the 
featuretype name and a link to the service, which he can use to make traditional WFS queries. 

Instance reasoning: 

User starts by searching OWLEntity classes by keyword "airport", which turns up the Airport class 
record.  The user then queries for airport classes using a SPARQL query.  The usedBy relationship 
information lets the catalog know which featuretypes from which WFS's it needs to retrieve data 
from to resolve the query.  Similarly, the impliedBy relationships let the catalog know which 
SWRL rules it needs to evaluate to resolve the query. 

How are the usedBy relationships created?  Some of them are inserted manually or created by 
harvesting, but others are the result of reasoning.  For example, you might manually add the 
relationships "{Airport Class} usedBy {Airport Dataset}" and "{Airfield Class} usedBy {Airfield 
Dataset}".  But if the OWL definition of the Airfield specifies that it is a type of Airport, the catalog 
would automatically add the relationship "{Airport Class} usedBy {Airfield Dataset}".

5.5 GML OWL 

Several activities were undertaken in this experiment around the idea of representing GML in the 
OWL language. This is not particularly far-fetched since early versions of GML were represented in 
RDF and GML still carries the object-property design pattern of RDF. Three stages of this 
representation might be described: 

• Representation of metadata for GML features (e.g. FGDC, ISO 19115/139) in OWL. The IfGi 
implementation took this approach to representing particular feature types in their query 
concept. The potential for using  

• Representation of GML schemas in OWL. There have been various efforts to render GML 
schema elements in OWL. The BBN geospatial SAIL infers an OWL description of (simple) 
GML features which it is able to access from remote WFS’. A more generalized representation 
is beyond the scope of this report. It has been complicated, among other things, by the fact that 
the GML feature “model” is not necessarily dependent on XML Schema but is largely 
expressed in XML Schema. 

• Representation of GML feature instances in OWL. There was debate during the experiment on 
the importance of this representation. The participants ended up identifying some use cases in 
which discovering the correct feature collection to query as GML is a sufficient result of 
semantic processing; they identified other use cases where there are advantages in having an 
OWL representation of individual features, for determining whether they in fact satisfy the 
query, for participating in further processing (e.g. spatial buffering) and for relating the 
vocabulary of the features back to the query vocabulary (brokering). 

Initial investigations suggest that there is a substantial profile of the GML 3.1.1 schema which could be 
represented in OWL without great difficulty. It also appears feasible, again for a GML profile,  that 
substantially the same XML encoding for feature instances / individuals could serve to express both 
GML and GML/OWL. This would be a very worthwhile goal for future work. 

5.6 Filter / geospatial ontology 

The filter/geospatial ontologyshown in Annex A  together with rules expresssions (“GeoSWRL”) was 
used in the experiment both to process geospatial relationships and to construct WFS filter queries.  

6 Conclusions and next steps 

As stated at the beginning of this report, each of the activities and accomplishments of this experiment 
may be considered preliminary or initial steps towards GSW development. A number of conclusions 
and next steps are listed below; the lists are by no means exclusive. The overall value of the 
experiment is largely in enabling future activities to be undertaken with greater clarity of purpose, 
means, and expectation. 

Concluding observations 

• Semantic interoperability between participants was itself difficult to achieve.  

• Experiment revealed many interesting and open research questions.

• Also discovered some disparities between rigor and utility 

• Useful ontologies are not easy or quick to develop. 

• Ontologies are typically not universal or immutable. Nature of a useful ontology depends on its 
purpose and context. 

• GSW encompasses a wide range of use cases and distributive models. Some are compatible 
with existing OGC specifications and some are not (yet). 

• This experiment has not “tested” new specifications, but has provided important material for 
defining them. 

• Semantic processing has usable existing technology and great potential but requires extensive 
outreach, modest initial expectations, and testing against specific use cases for further GSW 
development. 

• Assessment of semantic interoperability is still a work in progress: 

• Semantic problems in geo-spatial data need to be clarified in order to be addressed 

• There won’t be one method solving all semantic problem types (man’s-eye view). 

• There are use cases for representing reality directly, as well as indirecty through representations 
/ models 

Next Steps 

• Test implementations of (proposed) standard semantic OWS service profiles 

• Refine and enrich developed ontologies (e.g. GML) 

• Access, utilize, harmonize with other ontologies 

• Apply methodology to new discovery and query use cases 

• Refine and implement broker role in SOA: provision with translation
