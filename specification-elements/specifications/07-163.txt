 Data View Architecture Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC document presents a summary of the Data View Architecture experiment 

conducted as part of the Geo-Processing Workflow (GPW) thread in the OWS-5 test bed.  

The main activities in this experiment were the storage of Data Views in an ebRIM 

Catalog and the discovery and use of those Data Views by an Integrated Client. 

Although the Data View concept presented in this report is of general purpose in nature, 

the experiment conducted as part of the OWS-5 test bed investigated Data Views as 

applied specifically to NGA artifacts.

1.4 Future work 

The participants in this study believe there is the potential to extend the Data View 

grouping mechanism to other types of data. Within the OWS-5 test bed, Data Views were 

used to group feature types presented by a Web Feature Service. Further work may be 

desirable to investigate the possibility of applying Data Views to other types of data such 

as layers published by a Web Map Service and observation offerings published by a 

Sensor Observation Service.

5 Data View Architecture Overview 

The principle motivation for the Data View concept addresses the need for clients to be 

able to access required data without a detailed knowledge of the available service 

endpoints. The client experience is simplified by presenting only a list of Data Views that 

represent a collection of actual feature types. The data view can be seen as a grouping or 

categorization of a set of feature types or layers as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 — Data View Architecture Overview  

A WFS is a service that offers a collection of feature types. Given a service endpoint for a 

WFS, a client may bind to a service and browse its feature type offerings. If many such 

services and feature types are available, building the desired operational picture with an 

integrated client can be tedious and time-consuming. 

The availability of Data Views considerably simplifies the process of creating an 

operational picture. A Data View defines a grouping of feature types judged to be of 

value when presented together. By selecting one or more Data Views, an analyst using an 

integrated client can build an operational picture much more rapidly than by researching 

and handpicking from among many, many feature types individually. A discovery service 

such as an OGC catalog can allow a client to find views of interest and to locate the 

endpoints of WFS services that offer the feature types associated with the selected views. 

The Data View concept originates in the NSG Entity Catalog (NEC) [1]1
)
. The 

introduction to Appendix A - NEC View Thesaurus presents this example: 

 The entities “Aerial”, “Building”, “Communication Line”, and “Wireless 
Telecommunication Information”, 

 are associated with the View “Communication Facilities”. 

 The “Building” entity is also associated with other Views, e.g., “General 
Structures” and “Manufacturing Installations”. 

The NEC View Thesaurus also states that views may be used with entities in the NSG 

Application Schema (NAS), which is how we made use of Data Views in this test bed. 

                                                 

1) Although the term Data View is used in this report, the NEC defines a shorter term View to give meaning to this same 
concept. The NEC also defines a term called View Group, but that concept was not explored in this test bed.

6 Data View Architecture 

6.1 Data View Enterprise Viewpoint 

The Enterprise Viewpoint describes the purpose of the architecture. 

It is unreasonable to expect all users of a client application to have a ready knowledge of 

the feature types available through Web Services that comprise the type of view being 

generated. For this reason, the concept of a Data View has been created. A Data View 

represents a collection of feature types or layers and provides a way to categorize a set of 

feature types or layers into groupings. 

For example, instead of the user being required to make a number of catalog queries in 

order to determine the service endpoints that serve ROADS, TRAILS, RAILWAYS and 

TUNNELS the user can simply select a Data View called “Transportation”. By selecting 

Transportation, the catalog determines, through associations, what feature types are 

included in this category and returns the appropriate catalog response identifying the web 

service(s) from which a user can retrieve that data. 

A high-level depiction of the Data View concept is shown in the use case diagram in 

Figure 2. A data custodian (such as a catalog authority) publishes feature type offerings 

from web feature services, as well as a set of views, where each view is a grouping of 

feature types. An analyst (via an Integrated Client software application) may then query 

those holdings to find one or more views of interest and determine the feature types 

associated with each those views. Once a feature type is known, the analyst may again 

query the holdings to determine one or more web feature services that offer that feature 

type. Finally, the analyst directs the client application to bind to those web feature 

services, display the selected feature types and ultimately create an operational picture. 

The Data Views, which provide predefined feature groupings, expedite the process of 

creating an operational picture.

Figure 2 — Data View Use Case Diagram 

 

The following scenario details a typical flow of information based on client requests: 

1. The USER has a mission that requires knowledge of Power Generation facilities over 
a particular geographic area.  

2. Using the Client, the USER queries the Catalog for Data View descriptions.  

3. The Catalog returns to the Client the Textual Description of all the Data Views. 
Included in the response is the description of the Power Generation and Transmission 

Facilities data view and the Communication Facilities data view.  Also returned is a 

listing of the associated “user-friendly” feature type names for the different data 

views. These “user-friendly” names may or may not match exactly the actual names 

of the feature types served by a particular WFS. 

4. The USER selects the Power Generation and Transmission Facilities data view and 
the Communications Facilities data view for feature retrieval. The Client queries the 

Catalog with the data view information and receives a listing of the actual feature 

type names. 

5. The Client queries the Catalog, providing a geographic area of interest, to determine 
the WFS endpoints that satisfy these features.  



OGC 07-163

6. The Client presents the USER with a list of data view(s) and associated features types 
indicating availability or no availability.  

7. The Client also indicates if specific feature types are available from more than one 
location. (Some features from Local MSD and some from DVOF data):  

a. Power Generation and Transmission Facilities  

i. In common features = Buildings, Power line, Smokestack  

ii. Features from Local MSD = Buildings, Cooling Tower, Power lines, Power 
station, Power substation.  

iii. Features from DVOF = Building, Power line, Power line pylon, Pylon, 
Smokestack  

b. Communication Facilities 

i. In common features = Buildings  

ii. Features from Local MSD = Buildings, Cable, Tower  

iii. Features from DVOF = Building, Pylon 

8. The USER selects feature types for download.  

9. The Client automatically binds to the WFS service(s) to extract those selected feature 
types and displays the features.  

 

NOTE Based on the flow described above, similar data coming from various WFS resources may 
represent a duplication of data. If needed, the Client could also execute additional functionality to conflate 
this data into a single representation. This work is being investigated in the GeoProcessing Workflow 
thread. 

 

6.2 Data View Information Viewpoint 

The Information Viewpoint presents a description of the architecture data models. 

This section presents a UML model of the Data View Architecture, discusses the 

information content of a Data View object and the modeling of the Data View 

Architecture in an ebRIM Catalog. 

6.2.1 UML Class Diagram of Data View Architecture 

The UML class diagram in Figure 3 depicts the data objects that comprise the Data View 

concept presented in this document. The role of the object named Registry Object in this 

diagram is to capture metadata about the objects it references; the Registry Object is a 

principle building block of an ebRIM Catalog.

Figure 3 — Data View Class Diagram 

 

As can be seen in Figure 3, a Data View encoding is based on the DDMS metadata 

specification. Many Data Views may be defined in a single DDMS metadata file. 

6.2.2 Data View XML Encoding 

The Data View is encoded as DDMS metadata. In a DDMS metadata file, the feature 

types comprising a data view are defined using namespace-qualified names (QNames) 

located in elements reachable via the XPath expression 

//ddms:subjectCoverage/ddms:Subject/ddms:category. These feature types 

directly refer to feature types defined in the NSG Application Schema (NAS) [1]. The 

following is an example of a DDMS metadata record defining the Data View 

“Agricultural Buildings and Structures”: 

 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 

<!-- A DDMS v1.4.1 metacard for a GSIP v1.8.1 View.  Its Subjects 

are its associated Feature Types (labels and codes). -->

6.2.3 Modeling Data View Resources in ebRIM 

In OWS-5, the ebRIM profile of the Catalog 2.0.2 specification was selected to satisfy 

the discovery goals for the Data View architecture. This section describes the modeling 

of the Data View architecture resources in ebRIM. 

Figure 4 depicts the resources in the Data View architecture. These resources are: 

 The Data View objects which are encoded as DDMS metadata 

 The NEC feature catalog that defines the feature types involved, and 

 The WFS services that serve instances of those feature types.

Figure 4 — Resources in the Data View Architecture 

 

NOTE From an implementation perspective, the Data View objects and WFS services in this 
architecture relate most directly to feature types as defined in the NSG Application Schema (NAS). The 
NAS is an XML encoding of the NEC. 

In order to store resources in an ebRIM Catalog, those resources must first be mapped 

into the ebRIM information model. Here is an overview of the mapping into ebRIM of 

the resources in the Data View architecture: 

 The NEC feature catalog becomes an ebRIM classification scheme. 

 Each of the feature types defined in the NEC becomes an ebRIM classification 
node. 

 Each Data View (encoded as DDMS metadata) is mapped to an ebRIM extrinsic 
object. 

 For each NEC feature type that is member of a data view, the corresponding 
classification node is associated with the data view extrinsic object. 

 Each WFS service is harvested into the catalog using the usual ebRIM structure 
for OGC services. [7] (In particular, for OWS-5, each OGC feature type object in 

the catalog is classified by the corresponding NEC classification node.)

6.2.4 Modeling Data View Resources in ebRIM, Harvesting Details 

This section contains details of the harvesting of resources into the ebRIM catalog. 

6.2.4.1 Harvesting of NAS QNames 

When referenced in some resource to be harvested, NAS QNames are turned into 

concepts (ebRIM ClassificationNodes), belonging to an ebRIM ClassificationScheme 

identified by the namespace of the QName. Within the catalog used in the OWS-5 test 

bed, this mechanism is a feature that allows for easy reference by URI of externally 

defined concepts, such as concepts defined in online OWL files, taxonomies, etc. 

Then, when harvesting a resource that contains a reference to some NAS QName (e.g. 

http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/schema/nas#AeroNavaid), a 

ClassificationNode named AeroNavaid is created, belonging to the ClassificationScheme 

uniquely identified by http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/schema/nas. 

(The UUID of the ClassificationScheme is actually the MD5 hash of this URI, as 

specified in ebRIM 3.0 for the conversion of URIs into UUIDs). 

If the ClassificationScheme and/or ClassificationNode already exist, they are reused. 

Thus, harvesting the DDMS Data View definitions creates or reuses concepts from the 

NEC Thesaurus; the same happens when harvesting NAS metadata. Therefore, Data 



OGC 07-163

Views and NAS instances are actually linked in the ebRIM structure via those 

ClassificationNodes. 

The NAS ClassificationScheme, as harvested in the OWS-5 ebRIM Catalog, can be found 

at: 

http://dev.ionicsoft.com:8085/ionicwrs/wrs/WRS?request=GetRecordB

yId&id=urn:F6318082-AC97-F6A0-FF07-

D3A50332AFEF&outputSchema=EBRIM 

 

where urn:F6318082-AC97-F6A0-FF07-D3A50332AFEF is the MD5 hash of 

http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/schema/nas . 

6.2.4.2 Harvesting of Data Views 

Data Views, when harvested in the catalog, are stored in ExtrinsicObjects complying with 

the following structure: 

[objectType=urn:x-ogc:specification: 

  csw-ebrim:ObjectType:Schema:XML-Schema:DDMSResource] 

     |---- [Slot] identifier 

     |---- [Slot] medium 

     |---- [Slot] copyrights 

     |---> Creator ---> [Organization] 

 

(At the moment, Data Views are classified with the NAS ClassificationNodes that are 

found in the ddms:Subject/ddms:category of the Data Views definitions. This 

should change in favor of an association, like containsFeatureType.) 

As a sample, the Aeronautical En Route Navigational Aids Data View has the UUID 

urn:uuid:f38273f2-f31f-4c1e-90a4-6950dfdd4e58 . 

It can be retrieved here: 

http://dev.ionicsoft.com:8085/ionicwrs/wrs/WRS?request=GetRecordB

yId&id=urn:uuid:f38273f2-f31f-4c1e-90a4-

6950dfdd4e58&outputSchema=EBRIM 

 

6.2.4.3 Harvesting of NAS/ISO-19115 Metadata 

NAS metadata is defined as an extension of ISO19115 metadata. On the other hand, the 

CIM Extension Package defines the mapping from ISO19115 metadata to the equivalent 

ebRIM structure. 

Therefore, NAS metadata is harvested in the catalogue using the CIM mapping, with 

extra elements added to the CIM structure where needed. 

[objectType=urn:x-ogc:specification: 

  csw-ebrim-nas:ObjectType:NasDataMetadata]

 |---- (various CIM slots and associations) 

 |---> AssociationType_Contains ---> [Content] 

 

In this structure, the Content object type is a custom object type, added to hold, through 

classifications, the NEC ClassificationNodes that are found in the 

/gmd:MD_FeatureCatalogueDescription/nas:featureTypes elements of the 

NAS metadata documents. 

The sample NAS metadata document bundled with the schema has been harvested in the 

catalog:

6bb21798af96&outputSchema=EBRIM 

6.2.4.4 Harvesting a Web Feature Service 

Web Services are generally harvested into a catalog using a request based on the service 

type [7]. For example, the following is a GET request to harvest the Snowflake WFS into 

the OWS-5 catalog: 

http://dev.ionicsoft.com/ows4catalog/wrs/WRS?request=harvest&vers

ion=2.0.0&ResourceType=WFS&Source= 

http://demo.snowflakesoftware.com:8080/ows5_features_inline/Featu

res&outputSchema=EBRIM 

6.3 Data View Computational Viewpoint 

The Computational Viewpoint is concerned with the functional decomposition of the 

system into a set of distinct components that interact at interfaces. 

For OGC, such components are generally realized as web services. The web services of 

principle concern in this exploration of the Data View architecture are the Web Feature 

Service and the ebRIM Catalog Service. 

6.3.1 Web Feature Service 

For the OWS-5 test bed, Snowflake Software deployed a web feature (WFS) service that 

served sample Local Mission Specific Data (MSD) provided by NGA. The Local MSD 

data provided was based on a subset of the NSG Application Schema (NAS). 

A Data View associates a group of feature types defined in an application schema. The 

Data Views constructed for experimentation in the test bed contained feature types in the 

NAS, a subset of which was published by the Snowflake WFS. 

6.3.2 ebRIM Catalog Service 

Leica Geosystems deployed an ebRIM catalog service to provide discovery services for 

the OWS-5 test bed.

The catalog deployed in the OWS-5 test bed offered an ebRIM 1.0.0 profile of Catalog 

2.0.2 specification as defined in [4]. 

6.4 Data View Engineering Viewpoint 

The Engineering Viewpoint describes specific components linked by a communications 

network and is concerned with the interaction of distinct computational objects. 

In the OWS-5 test bed, these are the components that played a role in the Data View 

architecture experiment: 

 An ebRIM Catalog 1.0.0, provided by Leica Geosystems 

 A Web Feature Service (WFS 1.1.0), provided by Snowflake Software, and 

 An Integrated Client, provided by Intergraph Corporation. 

Figure 7 depicts the high-level interaction between the Integrated Client and the ebRIM 

Catalog service. The Integrated Client submits a query (request message) to the catalog 

and receives a result set (response message) containing metadata for the resources of 

interest.

6.4.1 Test Bed Data View Use Case 

Here is a list of the questions asked of the ebRIM Catalog by the Integrated Client to 

implement the test bed use case for the Data View architecture: 

1. What are the available data views? 

2. What are the feature types that are members of a given data view? 

3. Of those feature types that are members of a given data view, which are actually 
being served by one or more WFS services? 

4. What are the URLs of the WFS services that serve a given Feature Type? 

6.4.2 Client Request Messages Submitted to ebRIM Catalog 

The following clauses describe in detail the request messages sent by the Integrated 

Client to the ebRIM Catalog service to demonstrate the Data View architecture use case 

implemented by Intergraph.

6.4.3 Presentation of Data Views in the Integrated Client 

This section presents the handling of Data Views and the associated Feature Types in the 

Integrated Client provided by Intergraph Corporation. 

Figure 8 depicts the Data View query dialog offered by the Integrated Client. The user 

selects a catalog endpoint (1), enters the keyword “Power,” (2) and the name of the single 

Data View matching that keyword is returned from the ebRIM Catalog (3).

Figure 9 demonstrates the ability to browse a larger selection of Data Views in the 

catalog. The user enters a max-records threshold (1), and the names of a selection of Data 

Views are presented. Here the user also has the opportunity to explore the Feature Type 

instances that have been harvested in the catalog (from the Snowflake WFS) that belong 

to each Data View (2). 

The user is also presented with the list of all of the Feature Types that are members of the 

Data View (3). (However, as can be seen in (2), Feature Type data exists for only “Wall” 

and “Building.”) 

Finally, the user is presented with an overall description of the selected Data View (4).

Figure 10 demonstrates that a Feature Type can have membership in more than one Data 

View. In this example, “Building” is a member of “Communication Facilities” (1), and as 

shown previously in Figure 9-(2), “Building” is also member of “Agricultural Buildings 

and Structures.”

Figure 11 depicts the portrayal of the selected Feature Types in the client, and shows the 

ability of the user to arrange the Feature Types in the legend to govern the display order 

(1).

And finally, in Figure 12, the user may see the selected Feature Types grouped (1) via 

their membership in the selected Data Views (2a)(2b)(2c). Note that Feature Types 

“Cable” and “Building” have membership in more than one Data View.
