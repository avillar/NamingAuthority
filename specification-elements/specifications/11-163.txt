vi. Future work 

The netCDF standard is evolving from version 3 (netCDF3) to version 4 (netCDF4) that 
adopts an abstract Common Data Model (CDM) to be implemented in different 
encodings (e.g. netCDF and ncML). This transition affects the possible ways to 
accommodate uncertainty, including what proposed in this document. 

In thefuture, a netCDF4approach for uncertainty encodingwill be investigated. Since 
netCDF4 accepts data structures as values,it is feasible to extend the netCDF model to 
include uncertain data types. A data structure can be used to represent an uncertain data 
type (such as an uncertain integer or an uncertain float) according to the UncertML 
model. This approach is the most flexible, since it will allow the definition of an algebra 
for uncertainty and to implement it in a netCDF API extension.

Introduction 

As discussed in [4], from a theoretical perspective, it can be said that no dataset is a 
perfect representation of the reality it purports to represent. 

Inevitably errors, arising from the observation process, including the sensor system and 
subsequent processing, differences in scales of phenomena and the spatial support of the 
observation mechanism as well as a lack of knowledge about the detailed conversion 
between the measured quantity and the target variable means that in principle all data 
should be treated as uncertain. 

The most natural representation of an uncertain quantity is in terms of random variables 
(or fields / functions for spatially and temporally distributed variables), with a 
probabilistic approach. 

However, it must be acknowledged that almost all existing data resources are not treated 
in this way. Most datasets come simply as a series of values, often without any 
uncertainty information. If there is uncertainty information, then this is typically 
contained within the metadata, in a data quality element. This is typically a global 
(dataset wide) representation of uncertainty, often derived through some form of 
validation process. Typically, it is a statistical measure of spread, for example the 
standard deviation of the residuals (data set measured minus ‘true’ value). 

The introduction of a mechanism by which such descriptions of uncertainty can be 
integrated into existing geospatialapplications is considered a practical step towards a 
more accurate modeling of our uncertain understanding of any natural process. 

This document proposes a linked data approach forthe widely used netCDF format. To 
encode uncertainty information in a netCDF dataset, it is possible to consider at least the 
following approaches: 

1. To define a netCDF convention to specify uncertainty-related concepts in a 
netCDF file, enabling the representation of uncertain quantities, as well as values 
known with a given uncertainty; 

2. Linked netCDF: to adopt the Semantic Web linked data approach, expressing the 
uncertainty in an XML document according to the UncertML model, which is 
then linked to netCDF-CF attributes and variables using inbound or outbound 
XLink references. This approach is valuable for re-use of data sets since 
uncertainty information can be associated to known values without affecting the 
existing encodings, applying Semantic Web principles and technologies;

OGC® NetCDF-U Discussion Paper 

1 Scope 

This OGC® document introduces a set of conventions and mechanisms that extend and 
qualify the netCDF3 data model and format to model uncertain information: the NetCDF 
Uncertainty Conventions (NetCDF-U). 

Given the generality and flexibility of the netCDF data model, conventions on naming, 
semantics and data structure have been adopted by several community of practice, as a 
means of improving data interoperability. Some of the existing conventions may include 
specific provisions on uncertain elements and concepts, but, to our knowledge, no general 
convention on the encoding of uncertainty has been proposed, to date, what is the scope 
of this document. 

This OGC™ document is applicable to data encoded in the netCDF3 format, with 
possible limitations, depending on conflicting conventions to which a given netCDF 
dataset may be compliant, in addition to NetCDF-U (in general, a netCDF may be 
compliant with more than one convention). 

The NetCDF-U Conventions are designed to be fully compatible with the netCDF 
Climate and Forecast Conventions, the de-facto standard for a large amount of data in the 
Fluid Earth Science community.

5 Compatibility with NetCDF-CF 

An important constraint for NetCDF-U is to preserve compatibility with the NetCDF 
Climate and Forecast Conventions (NetCDF-CF) [Eaton 2010], whose data model is 
represented below. 

 

Figure 1 – NetCDF-CF 1.5 data model (source: [1]) 

 

NetCDF-CF mentions the issue of uncertainty representation and provides mechanisms 
for its expression, including the following: 



 

4 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 Data variables may be associated to variables representing their uncertainty via 
the ancillary_variables attribute; 

 Data variables representing uncertainty may be expressed via modifiers of the 
quantity standard name attribute (actually, only the standard_error modifier is 
relevant to the present context); 

 Common statistical operators are expressed via the cell_methods attribute, e.g. 
mean, standard deviation, variance; 

 

Where possible, the above mechanisms are leveraged by NetCDF-U, e.g. using the same 
attributes name with compatible semantics. 

6 NetCDF Uncertainty Conventions 

This section describes the proposed NetCDF Uncertainty Conventions (NetCDF-U) for 
capturing uncertainty in netCDF-encoded data. 

NetCDF files compliant with these conventions may be indicated as “netCDF-U files” in 
the following. 

6.1 Rationale 

These conventions have the following rationale: 

 Compatibility with netCDF-CF Conventions 1.5; 
 Human-readability of conforming datasets structure; 
 Minimal difference between certain/agnostic and uncertain representations of data 

(e.g. with respect to dataset structure). 

6.2 Global provisions 
6.2.1 Identification of Conventions 

NetCDF-U files shall declare the global attribute Conventions2 with the string value 
“UW-1.0” (see the example in the next section). 

6.2.2 Primary and ancillary variables 

A netCDF file typically contains several variables. Some of these may depend on others, 
i.e. contain ancillary information referred to or qualifying concepts encoded by other 
variables (e.g., netCDF-CF introduces the concepts of coordinate variable, boundary 
variable, flag variable.) 

                                                

2Lower-case “conventions” attribute name should be acceptable. However, netCDF-CF specify the upper-case form. 



 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 5 
 

Similarly to netCDF-CF, netCDF-U variables may declare an ancillary_variables 
attribute for expressing dependency relationships among variables. 

Dually, netCDF-U files may declare a primary_variables global attribute, whose value is 
a white-separated list of variable identifiers. 

The intended use of the primary_variables attribute is to support applications in directly 
accessing their presumable data of interest, particularly since netCDF-U files are likely to 
contain a large number of ancillary variables, as in the example below. 

 

netcdfbiotemperature { 
// global attributes: 
:Conventions = "CF-1.5 UW-1.0"; 
:primary_variables = "biotemperature"; 
dimensions: 
lon = 240 ; 
lat = 163 ; 
variables: 
doublelon(lon) ; 
lon:long_name = "longitude"; 
lon:units = "degrees_east"; 
lon:standard_name = "longitude"; 
doublelat(lat); 
lat:long_name = "latitude"; 
lat:units = "degrees_north"; 
lat:standard_name = "latitude"; 
doublebiotemperature_mean(lat, lon); 
biotemperature_mean:missing_value = -999.; 
biotemperature_mean:ref = 
"http://www.uncertml.org/distributions/normal#mean"; 
doublebiotemperature_variance(lat, lon); 
biotemperature_variance:missing_value = -999.; 
biotemperature_variance:ref = 
"http://www.uncertml.org/distributions/normal#variance"; 
doublebiotemperature(lat, lon); 
biotemperature:units = "degC"; 
biotemperature:ancillary_variables = 
"biotemperature_meanbiotemperature_variance"; 
biotemperature:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/distributions/normal"; 
} 
 

6.3 Uncertain concepts 

The main mechanism for capturing uncertain concepts in netCDF-U files consists of 
encoding them (and their possible values) in netCDF data variables annotated with 
uncertainty-related semantics. 



 

6 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

To this end, a netCDF variable referring to uncertain concepts shall declare a ref attribute, 
whose value is a list of space-separated URIs of UncertML 2.0 dictionary entries (see the 
conceptual model in Figure 2). 

 

Figure 2 – UncertML 2.0 conceptual model 

 

For the sake of generality, we allow for multiple URIs: this could support the expression 
of compound UncertML concepts (although this use-case is probably not so relevant, 
within the current version of the UncertMLdictionary). 

Besides, anticipating a general support to semantic annotations in netCDF, an uncertain 
variable may also declare a rel attribute, whose value is a list of space-separated 
identifiers of the relationships between the variable and the corresponding URI in the ref 
attribute. In particular, the identifier for the above relationship shall be the string value 
“uncertainty”. If the rel attribute is missing, all the URIs are considered uncertainty-
related annotations. 



 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 7 
 

An uncertainty-related URI shall be resolvable to appropriate human-readable 
documentation of the respective dictionary concept. The syntax and semantics of the URI 
should be compliant to [IETF 3986]. 

6.3.1 Concept parameters 

The typical concept in the UncertML 2.0 dictionary is parameterized, with parameters of 
disparate types, from single scalar values to complex structures. 

A complex parameter shall be encoded in a separate variable, to be declared in the 
ancillary_variables attribute of the referring concept variable, and annotated with the 
concept URI and the parameter name as a fragment part3, as in the following example: 

 

variables: 
    float prob_greater_than_limit(Lat=163, Lon=240); 
prob_greater_than_limit:ref = 
"http://www.uncertml.org/statistics/probability"; 
prob_greater_than_limit:ancillary_variables = "limits"; 
float limits(Lat=163, Lon=240); 
limits:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/statistics/probability#gt"; 
 
 

For space optimization, a scalar parameter may be encoded as a variable attribute with 
the corresponding name, as in the following example: 

 

variables: 
    float second_order_moment(Lat=163, Lon=240); 
second_order_moment:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/statistics/moment"; 
second_order_moment:order = "2"; 
 

6.3.2 Concepts without values 

Since the current implementation of the netCDF library seems to allocate space for 
variables as soon as they are defined (even when no data have been written), concepts 
whose values are irrelevant or undefined (e.g. distributions characterized by parameters 
only) may be encoded as scalar variables, for the sake of space optimization. 

                                                

3Note that the semantics of the fragment part should be compliant to [IETF 3986]. In 
particular, if the referenced resource is an HTML document, the semantics of the 
fragment should be that of HTML anchors. 



 

8 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

In this case, the information about the intended shape of the variable shall be preserved in 
the attribute shape, as in the example below: 

 

doublebiotemperature; 
biotemperature:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/distributions/normal"; 
biotemperature:shape = “latlon”; 
biotemperature:ancillary_variables = 
"biotemperature_meanbiotemperature_variance"; 
 

6.4 Encoding of Samples 

A sample is defined as a set of realizations. Hence, it shall be encoded as a concept 
without values (§6.3.2) annotated with the related concept URI, linked to data variables 
corresponding to its related realizations by means of the ancillary_variables attribute, as 
in the example below. 

 

netcdf file:/Users/bigagli/Downloads/biotemperature_randomSamples.nc { 
dimensions: 
lon = 240; 
lat = 163; 
variables: 
doublebiotemperature(); 
biotemperature:missing_value = -999.0; // double 
biotemperature:shape = “latlon”; 
biotemperature:units = "degC"; 
biotemperature:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/samples/random"; 
biotemperature:ancillary_variables = "realisation1 realisation2"; 
doublelon(lon=240); 
lon:units = "degrees_east"; 
doublelat(lat=163); 
lat:units = "degrees_north"; 
double realisation1(lat=163, lon=240); 
realisation1:missing_value = -999.0; // double 
realisation1:units = "degC"; 
realisation1:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/samples/realisation"; 
realisation1:ID = "#12345"; 
double realisation2(lat=163, lon=240); 
realisation2:missing_value = -999.0; // double 
realisation2:units = "degC"; 
realisation2:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/samples/realisation"; 
realisation2:ID = "#12346"; 
 
:Conventions = "CF-1.5 UW-1.0"; 
:primary_variables = "biotemperature"; 
} 
 



 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 9 
 

For reducing the number of variables, especially when the single realizations have the 
same attributes, the sample variable may group all the realizations, indexing them along 
an extra additional dimension. In this case, the dimension variable corresponding to the 
additional dimension shall be annotated as a realization, as in the example below: 

 

netcdf file:/Users/bigagli/Downloads/biotemperature_randomSamples.nc { 
dimensions: 
lon = 240; 
lat = 163; 
realisation = 10; 
variables: 
doublebiotemperature(realization=10, lat=163, lon=240); 
biotemperature:missing_value = -999.0; // double 
biotemperature:shape = “latlon”; 
biotemperature:units = "degC"; 
biotemperature:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/samples/random"; 
doublelon(lon=240); 
lon:units = "degrees_east"; 
doublelat(lat=163); 
lat:units = "degrees_north"; 
doublerealisation(realisation=10); 
realisation:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/samples/realisation"; 
 
:Conventions = "CF-1.5 UW-1.0"; 
:primary_variables = "biotemperature"; 
} 
 

6.5 Encoding of Summary Statistics 

A summary statistics shall be encoded as a data variable annotated with the related 
concept URI. Summary statistics referring to the same stochastic variable shall be 
declared in the ancillary_variables attribute of a data variable annotated with the concept 
URI of a statistics collection, which may be declared in the primary_variables global 
attribute, as in the example below: 

 

netcdfbiotemperature { 
// global attributes: 
:Conventions = "CF-1.5 UW-1.0"; 
:primary_variables = "biotemperature"; 
dimensions: 
lon = 240 ; 
lat = 163 ; 
variables: 
doublelon(lon) ; 
lon:long_name = "longitude"; 
lon:units = "degrees_east"; 



 

10 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

lon:standard_name = "longitude"; 
doublelat(lat); 
lat:long_name = "latitude"; 
lat:units = "degrees_north"; 
lat:standard_name = "latitude"; 
doublebiotemperature_mean(lat, lon); 
biotemperature_mean:missing_value = -999.; 
biotemperature_mean:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/statistics/mean"; 
doublebiotemperature_variance(lat, lon); 
biotemperature_variance:missing_value = -999.; 
biotemperature_variance:ref = 
"http://www.uncertml.org/statistics/variance"; 
doublebiotemperature(lat, lon); 
biotemperature:units = "degC"; 
biotemperature:ancillary_variables = 
"biotemperature_meanbiotemperature_variance"; 
biotemperature:ref = "http://www.uncertml.org/statistics/statistics-
collection"; 
} 
 

6.6 Encoding of Distributions 

A distribution shall be encoded as a concept without values (§6.3.2) annotated with the 
related concept URI, linked to data variables corresponding to its parameters, which shall 
be declared in its ancillary_variables attribute. The distribution data variable may be 
declared in the primary_variables global attribute, as in the example below: 

 

netcdfbiotemperature { 
// global attributes: 
:Conventions = "CF-1.5 UW-1.0"; 
:primary_variables = "biotemperature"; 
dimensions: 
lon = 240 ; 
lat = 163 ; 
variables: 
doublelon(lon) ; 
lon:long_name = "longitude"; 
lon:units = "degrees_east"; 
lon:standard_name = "longitude"; 
doublelat(lat); 
lat:long_name = "latitude"; 
lat:units = "degrees_north";
