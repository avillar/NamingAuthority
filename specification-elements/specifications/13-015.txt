Preamble to the "OGC Best Practices for Sensor Web Enable-
ment: Provision of Observations through an OGC Sensor Ob-
servation Service (SOS)" 
 
An important aspect in order to improve the applicability of the Sensor Web technology to applica-
tion domains such as environment and health is to facilitate the practical use of the OGC Sensor 
Web Enablement (SWE) framework. This document reflects experiences and recommendations 
when using OGC SWE concepts in the research project EO2HEAVEN (Earth Observation and En-
vironmental Modelling for the Mitigation of Health Risks), co-funded by the European Commission 
as part of the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) Environmental theme. EO2HEAVEN contributes to 
a better understanding of the complex relationships between environmental changes and their im-
pact on human health.  
 
This document focuses on one basic issue: the provision of observations in an OGC SOS. 
This includes the definition of a lightweight profile of the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS), 
an analysis of and contribution to the specification of the SOS 2.0 as well as an approach how the 
data used within Earth observation (EO) applications can be integrated more easily into SOS in-
stances. It focuses on sensor data (observations) originating mainly from in-situ or mobile sensors 
providing measurements that may be mapped to a tabular format. 
 
The intended audience of this document includes system architects, information modelers and sys-
tem developers engaged in designing sensor service networks and related applications taking into 
account relevant OGC standards.

Title OGC Best Practices for Sensor Web Enablement: Provision of Observa-
tions through an OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) 

Creator Ed.: Thomas Usländer (Fraunhofer IOSB) 

Description This document comprises experiences and recommendations when us-ing Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) concepts. This document focuses on 
one basic issue: the provision of observations in an OGC SOS. 

This includes the definition of a lightweight OGC SOS profile (OGC 11-
169r1), an analysis of and contribution to the specification of the Sensor 
Observation Service (SOS) 2.0 as well as an approach how the data 
used within Earth observation (EO) applications can be integrated more 
easily into SOS instances. 

These recommendations result from the work performed in 2010-2013 
as part of the research project EO2HEAVEN (Earth Observation and 
Environmental Modelling for the Mitigation of Health Risks), co-funded 
by the European Commission as part of the 7th Framework Programme 
(FP7) Environmental theme. EO2HEAVEN contributes to a better under-
standing of the complex relationships between environmental changes 
and their impact on human health. See http://www.eo2heaven.org/ . 

The lightweight OGC SOS profile has been developed in close coopera-
tion between the FP7 projects EO2HEAVEN and UncertWeb (see 
http://www.uncertweb.org/ ).

1 Architectural Context 

The OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) architecture (OGC, 2008c) defines a conceptual approach 
to build a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for sensor data. This architecture provides the conceptual 
foundation and standard framework of the work presented in this document. 

In addition to the OGC SWE architecture, the present recommendations and tools rely upon the archi-
tectural work that has been carried out in a series of European research projects and submitted to OGC 
as best-practices work follows:  

 Reference Model of the ORCHESTRA Architecture (RM-OA) (OGC, 2007c), accepted as OGC 
best-practices paper in 2007, that instantiated and tailored the OGC Reference Model for the 
domain of environmental risk management following the ISO Reference Model for Open Dis-
tributed Processing (RM-ODP) (ISO/IEC 10746-1:1998), and 

 the Sensor Service Architecture (SensorSA) (OGC, 2009d), accepted as OGC discussion pa-
per in 2009, that extended the RM-OA towards a sensor-based environment following the OGC 
SWE architecture. 

The EO2HEAVEN architectural work has continued this architectural specification line in its multi-part 
specification of a Spatial Information Infrastructure (SII) (EO2HEAVEN, 2011a) integrating both in-situ 
and space-borne EO sensors. The present document is an excerpt of the EO2HEAVEN SII focusing on 
the advanced SWE concepts (EO2HEAVEN, 2011b) for the provision of observation in SOS instances.

2 Provision of Observations 

This paper provides recommendations on the provision of observation data in a consistent way. It co-
vers the following three main aspects: 

1. In section 2.1 the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) 2.0 (OGC, 2012a) standard is intro-
duced as a web service interface offering interoperable access to sensor data. The emphasis in 
this section is put on the specific advancements of the SOS 2.0 compared to version 1.0.  

2. In order to facilitate the application of the SOS 2.0 standard, section 2.2 recommends a light-
weight SOS profile for stationary in-situ sensors that focuses on the SOS core elements.  

3. Finally, section 2.3 introduces an approach how data owners can easily publish their data on 
SOS servers through a graphical import tool. 

2.1 Sensor Observation Service (SOS) Version 2.0 

2.1.1 Introduction 

Standardized access to sensor observations and sensor metadata is provided by the OGC SOS. Ob-
servations offered by the SOS can be collected by physical or virtual sensors (e.g. simulations or re-
sults of model calculations). The service acts as a mediator between a client and the sensor data ar-
chive or a physical sensor system. The heterogeneous communication protocols and data formats of 
the associated sensors are hidden by the standardized interface of the SOS. Sensor data requested by 
a client are returned as observations following the structure of the Observations and Measurements 
(O&M) model (ISO 19156:2011). The interface of the SOS supports access to heterogeneous sensor 
types, stationary as well as mobile sensors which gather their data in-situ or remotely.  

2.1.2 Challenges and Questions Addressed by the SOS 2.0 Standard 

This paper recommends the use of the SOS 2.0 (OGC, 2012a) as it is an evolutionary improvement of 
the SOS 1.0 standard. Based on the experiences gained with the SOS 1.0 specification (OGC, 2007a) 
the SOS 2.0 standard addresses several challenges. These are summarized as follows and described 
in more detail in the following sub-section: 

 Complexity reduction 

o Division into core, extensions, and requirements (classes) 

o Introduction of a key-value-pair (KVP) binding 

o Definition of O&M as default and mandatory response format for observations 

 Capabilities redesign 

o One sensor per observation offering to uniquely describe relationships between sen-
sors, observed properties, and features 

o New section: InsertionCapabilities for providing all metadata necessary for inserting 
new sensors and observations 

o Features of Interest are not listed in Contents anymore to reduce the length of the 
GetCapabilities responses 

 Result handling redesign 

o New operations: InsertResult and InsertResultTemplate 

o New operation: GetResultTemplate 

 Advanced feature retrieval

2.1.3 Summary of the SOS 2.0 Specification 

The development of the final version of the SOS 2.0 specification was completed in 2012 and the final 
standard document was published in the same year (OGC, 2012a).  

The main advancements from SOS 1.0 to SOS 2.0 are described in the following. 

Complexity Reduction 

A central goal of the development of SOS 2.0 has been the reduction of complexity of the standard to 
facilitate its application in software development. In this respect and by aiming at a better readability of 
the specification document, SOS 2.0 divides its operations and functionalities into a specification core 
and its extensions. The core comprises the mandatory operations for retrieval of the service metadata 
and its content (GetCapabilities), for querying observations (GetObservation), and for accessing sensor 
descriptions (DescribeSensor). The transactional extension contains operations for inserting new sen-
sor descriptions and sensor observations. The result handling extension specifies operations for inser-
tion and retrieval of pure observation results without observation metadata to increase performance and 
scalability. The enhanced extension amends the SOS functionality by providing optional operations, 
e.g. to enable the retrieval of observed features. By following OGC’s new modular specification model 
(OGC 2009a) the core and extensions of the SOS 2.0 specification consist of requirement classes con-
taining requirements, which convey criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the standard is claimed. 
This new design of the specification is more precise and facilitates conformance testing of compliant 
software components. 

In order to facilitate the usage of the SOS, version 2.0 of the standard adds an http GET binding for se-
lected operations. The operation parameters are passed to the service as key-value pairs in the URL of 
the service endpoint. This binding is reduced in complexity, but also in functionality, compared to the 
usual XML-based SOAP binding and simplifies the usage of the SOS. In the future, also a RESTful 
SOS binding would be desirable as mentioned in section 2.2. 

The SOS 1.0 specification did not define any response format as mandatorily supported. To restrict this 
generality and eventually improve interoperability the SOS 2.0 standard defines O&M as its mandatory 
and default response format for sensor data. Other response formats may still be supported by SOS 
servers. However, a formally accepted extension of the standard has to define how the service behaves 
in detail when responding in that format. The SOS 2.0 interface still does not define a default and man-
datory response format for the retrieval of sensor metadata. However, SensorML (OGC, 2012b) is men-
tioned as the recommended format. The Transducer Markup Language (TML), named in the SOS 1.0 
specification document as a potential response format, is not mentioned in the specification anymore. 
This decreases the options and increases interoperability among SOS 2.0 servers. 

Capabilities redesign 

A step towards simplifying the standard and streamlining the different SWE services is the introduction 
of the SWE Common specification (OGC 2008b) upon which the SOS 2.0 specification is based. A 
main part of that specification is the description of a common, SWE-wide model for the part of the self-
describing metadata document of a service, also known as capabilities document, which describes the 
content of a SWE service. For this contents section of the capabilities document, abstract types are de-
fined and reused by the SOS 2.0. 

Note: Other SWE services such as the Sensor Planning Service (SPS) 2.0 (OGC, 2009c) rely upon the 
SWE Common specification as well.  

The contents offered by a service are grouped into so-called offerings. In case of the SOS it is an ob-
servation offering. The SOS 1.0 specification has already used this concept. However, a redesign of the 
offering type restricts it now to aggregating only the observations gathered by exactly one instead of 
multiple sensor systems. Formerly, it has been up to the SOS provider to group observations to offer-
ings. This could have been done by different criteria: spatially, thematically (e.g., per sensor or ob-
served property), or temporally. The simple conceptual change of limiting the offering to one sensor 
system eases the set-up and the access to an SOS server, since grouping of observations to offerings 
is not ambiguous anymore.

An important concept within the SWE framework defined by the O&M model is the feature of interest. A 
feature of interest is the computational representation of a real-world entity modeled with a certain set 
of properties. This could be for example the feature “Gulf of Mexico”. Also, a sampling point “P_42” 
within the Gulf of Mexico, where a measurement was taken by a certain (maybe mobile) sensor system, 
is a feature of interest. Both could have properties such as water depth, salinity or geometry. In case of 
the SOS 1.0 standard all features of interest of the aggregated observations needed to be listed for 
each observation offering. This is helpful to provide clients a list of features for which observations can 
be requested. However, this listing of all features has been identified as a problem for mobile sensor 
systems (e.g., a boat taking measurements in the Gulf of Mexico), which create many sampling fea-
tures (e.g., sampling points) during operation. Those sampling features could accumulate to huge num-
bers and could increase the capabilities document up to an unusable size. Hence, SOS 2.0 servers do 
not list sampling features of interest in their capabilities document anymore. Instead, only those fea-
tures of interest shall be listed to which the sampling features belong to. In the example above, this 
would be “Gulf of Mexico” and not “P_42”. Listing those sampled features of interest supports the dis-
covery of observations. 

Result handling redesign 

The SOS 1.0 standard has already supported the retrieval of the pure observation results for a specified 
timestamp without the complete set of associated observation metadata. The purpose of this functional-
ity is to allow clients to repeatedly obtain sensor data without receiving responses that largely contain 
the same data except for a new timestamp and result value. This is in particular useful in scenarios with 
restricted bandwidth or for SOS clients with restricted processing power. The SOS 2.0 specification re-
designs and simplifies the GetResult operation involved in this retrieval of pure observations results. In 
particular, the response from the SOS server containing the results is defined in a more precise way. 
An additional operation is introduced (GetResultTemplate) which returns an exact description of the 
structure and the encoding of the results by making use of the SWE Service Common 2.0 data model. 

A functionality added by the SOS 2.0 standard is the insertion of pure observation results by means of 
new operations (InsertResultTemplate and InsertResult). These allow client components to insert sen-
sor results into an SOS without the need to repeatedly transmit the entire set of observation metadata. 
Similar to the result retrieval functionality, this functionality is useful if the communication bandwidth of 
the client, in this case the sensor data producer, is limited. 

Also, the capabilities model of the SOS 2.0 has been improved to better support the insertion of new 
data to SOS servers. A new section of the capabilities document (called insertion capabilities section) 
now states the observation type, result type, feature types, and encodings supported by a SOS server 
for insertion of results or observations. 

Advanced feature retrieval 

However, clients still need to be able to retrieve a list of sampling features from the SOS. The 
knowledge about existing sampling features is, for example, necessary for the construction of queries 
for sensor observations. For the retrieval of features of interest a separate operation, called GetFea-
tureOfInterest, has already been defined in the SOS 1.0 specification. In version 2.0 of the SOS stand-
ard this operation is extended in its parameterization. Not only a specific feature, or features for a cer-
tain spatial filter can be requested, also features which are observed by specified sensors or which car-
ry specified observed properties can be requested. And further, SOS 2.0 servers allow the clients to re-
quest all stored features of interest. 

2.1.4 Summary and Conclusion 

SOS 2.0 is a valuable evolutionary advancement of the SOS 1.0 standard. Its improvements are ex-
pected to be very useful for implementing efficient mechanisms for sensor data access as well as sen-
sor data publication. Special advantages of SOS 2.0 are the more compact approach of the capabilities 
as well as the unique definition how the offering concept has to be interpreted. This way, in combination 
with the lightweight SOS profile (section 2.2) interoperability between different SOS servers and clients 
is increased. Furthermore, the advanced feature handling capabilities of SOS 2.0 make it possible to 
build advanced client applications that allow filtering of observations based on spatial criteria.

2.2 Lightweight SOS Profile 

2.2.1 Introduction 

The Sensor Observation Service (SOS), in its version 1 (OGC, 2007a) and in its version 2 (OGC, 2012) 
as assessed in section 2.1, plays a central role in the OGC SWE architecture as it defines an interface 
for accessing sensor data and metadata.  

However, the SOS specification and the most important additional standards it relies on, are relatively 
complex to implement and use. These encompass the Observations and Measurements (O&M) specifi-
cation for conceptualizing (ISO 19156:2011) and encoding measurement data (OGC, 2011a) as well as 
the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) (OGC, 2007b) for encoding metadata,  

The reason for this is the extremely broad range of applications that these standards are supposed to 
support. On the one hand, this makes it possible to flexibly apply SWE to many different applications, 
on the other hand, the effort for understanding, implementing and applying the SWE standards increas-
es considerably. 

This section introduces an approach for a lightweight profile of the SOS by focusing on a set of com-
monly used elements of these standards and thus reducing the complexity of the specification.  

At a later stage this work may serve as a basis for developing domain-specific SWE profiles. 

2.2.2 Challenges and Questions 

This profile was designed in a way that is, on the one hand, efficient and easy to implement, and, on the 
other hand, standard compliant. Especially the following challenges were considered during the crea-
tion of the profile: 

 Reducing the number of operations: certain operations of the SOS standard were designed for 
very specific needs; these operations were left out of this profile 

 Reducing the complexity of the SOS operations (e.g. less complex filters for requesting sensor 
data) 

 Limiting the supported data formats to those used in practice (i.e. no support of the Transducer 
Markup Language (TML) within the SOS) 

In summary, the main aim that guided the development of this profile was 

 to support those use cases which are regularly occurring in practice, and 

 to leave out those with very specific requirements that go beyond the mainstream of SWE use 
cases. 

In the next section, it is described how a lightweight profile of the SOS may look like. The profile de-
scribed in this best practices paper is based on the 2.0 versions of the different SWE specifications. A 
more detailed description of this profile is attached as Annex A to this document and can also be found 
in (OGC, 2011b). 

2.2.3 Results 

The OGC SOS defines standardized interfaces for accessing sensor data and metadata. Thus, the 
SOS may be considered as the core element of the SWE architecture. It provides a means for integrat-
ing sensor data into Spatial Data Infrastructures like it is already possible for other kinds of geospatial 
data such as maps (through the OGC Web Map Service (WMS, OGC 2006), raster data (through the 
OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS, OGC 2008a) and geospatial objects (through the OGC Web Fea-
ture Service (WFS)). 

The following subsections explain which parts of the SOS need to be considered for a minimum profile 
that reduces its complexity and increases the efficiency.

2.2.3.1 SOS Operations 

This lightweight SOS profile comprises those operations, which are mandatory within the SOS standard 
(GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor and GetObservation) so that they shall be implemented by every 
standard compliant SOS server. Furthermore, the GetFeatureOfInterest operation was included as it al-
lows accessing the geometries of sensor stations. 

The GetCapabilities operation is common for every OGC web service specification. It is important to 
support this operation as it provides the metadata necessary for clients to generate valid SOS requests. 
It contains especially the following information: 

 Supported operations of the SOS instance 

 Identifiers of all sensors encapsulated by the SOS instance 

 Identifiers of all observed phenomena 

 Offerings 
Note: As described in section 2.1.3, the SOS 2.0 standard requires a  unique relationships be-
tween exactly one sensor and its observed phenomena. 

The DescribeSensor operation allows the client to retrieve metadata about the sensors encapsulated by 
an SOS instance. It is a mandatory element of the SOS specification. Thus, it is included in the mini-
mum profile so that servers must offer this operation. However, clients need not necessarily make use 
of the DescribeSensor operation. The request of the DescribeSensor operation is very simple as the 
only parameter consists of the identifier of the sensor for which a metadata document is requested. The 
response is a SensorML document (a simple structure for such a SensorML document is defined below 
in section 2.2.3.3). 

The GetObservation operation is an essential part of the SOS specification as it is the operation for re-
questing sensor data. Thus, it is obvious that this operation is needed for both servers and clients. 
However, in order to reduce the complexity of the GetObservation operation several restrictions have 
been defined that limit the query parameters. In detail the following parameters are included in this 
lightweight SOS profile: 

 Offering: the identifier of the offering that contains the requested sensor data 

 Temporal filter for specifying the time for which sensor data is requested; however the temporal 
filters are limited within the lightweight SOS profile to the following types: during a time period 
and equal to a time instant 

 Procedure: the identifiers of the sensors from which data is requested 

 Observed property: the identifier of the phenomena for which data is requested 

 Feature of interest: the geometry object for which data is requested; within the lightweight SOS 
profile this is limited to identifiers of the geometric objects for which sensor data is requested 

 Spatial filter: Bounding box of an area for which data is requested 

The GetFeatureOfInterest operation allows retrieving the geometries of the stations at which measure-
ments were performed. As the access to the geometries of measurements is a requirement for creating 
map visualizations of the sensors and their data, the GetFeatureOfInterest operation has been included 
for servers in this lightweight SOS profile. However, not every client might rely on this operation (e.g. 
clients that only show diagrams of time series data). In order to reduce the complexity of this operation, 
its request parameters are restricted within this profile. Clients may request geometries using only one 
of these parameters: 

 featureOfInterest: the identifier of the requested feature of interest 

 spatialFilter: bounding box describing an area for which features are requested 

 observedProperty: identifiers of the properties that shall be observed at the requested features.

 procedure: identifiers of the procedures that shall observe the requested features 

In case of this profile, the response of the GetFeatureOfInterest operation shall always contain one or 
more SamplingPoints. 

2.2.3.2 Observations and Measurements 

The Observations and Measurements standard offers an encoding for data observed by sensors. How-
ever, as O&M has been designed to be extremely versatile and comprehensive it has also a certain 
complexity. Thus, this lightweight profile has been defined containing only those elements of O&M, 
which are essential for most common use cases. Within the lightweight SOS profile, the following ob-
servation types are included: 

 

Observation Type Result Type Description Example 
Measurement   gml:MeasureType   scalar numerical value with 

unit of measurement   
<om:result uom=”Cel”>36 
</om:result>   

CountObservation   xs:integer   count of an observed property   <om:result>12</om:result>   
TruthObservation   xs:boolean   truth value (often existence) 

of an observed property   
<om:result>true

Table 1 Supported Observation Types of the Lightweight SOS Profile 

Note: Table 1 is taken from the OGC Discussion Paper (OGC, 2011b) and has been slightly enhanced 
(addition of SWE Common Observations) 

In order to minimize the complexity of O&M documents, the responses of SOS servers need only to 
contain a limited set of O&M elements. These are: 

 gml:identifier (mandatory): this element shall be provided for uniquely identifying or referring to 
a specific observation. 

 om:phenomenonTime (mandatory): the time instant or time period for which the observation 
contains sensor data; within the lightweight profile this is restricted to the data types TimeIn-
stant and TimePeriod.  

 om:resultTime (mandatory): the time when the result became available. 

 om:procedure (mandatory): the identifier of the sensor that has generated the observation 

 om:observedProperty (mandatory): the identifier of the phenomenon that was observed 

 om:featureOfInterest (mandatory): an identifier of the geometric feature (e.g. sensor station) to 
which the observation is associated; within the lightweight profile this is limited to sampling

2.2.3.3 Sensor Model Language 

The Sensor Model Language (SensorML) is used within the SOS for encoding the sensor metadata 
documents that are returned in case of DescribeSensor requests.  

This lightweight profile defines a minimum set of metadata that shall be provided in a SensorML docu-
ment. Complex elements of SensorML that are intended for very specific applications are not consid-
ered within this lightweight profile but may be added if necessary. 

The following metadata items are considered mandatory for a SensorML document: 

 gml:description: A short textual description of the sensor or sensor system 

 gml:identifier:  A unique identifier of the sensor system 

 sml:keywords: Terms which help to describe the sensor system and serve for discovery pur-
poses (e.g. observed phenomena, name of the sensor location) 

 sml:identification: A short and a long name referring to the sensor system  

 sml:classification: At least a classifier identifying the sensor type 

 sml:contacts: Contact information about the operator of the sensor 

 sml:featuresOfInterest: abstraction of the real world entity, the feature of interest, which is ob-
served by the sensor system. In case of this profile, the feature of interest is a station and mod-
elled as a SamplingPoint. 

 The outputs of the sensors (identifiers of the observed phenomena and if necessary the units of 
measurement) 

A further restriction is that every sensor shall be modelled as a SensorML system. Other types are not 
considered for this profile. 

2.2.4 Conclusion 

In summary this section has provided a pragmatic approach how the complexity of the SOS, O&M and 
SensorML standards can be reduced by defining according minimum profiles. This makes it easier to 
apply SWE concepts more quickly and with less overhead for familiarizing with the specifications. Alt-
hough these minimum profiles reduce the flexibility of these standards, we expect that most common 
applications can be covered by these profiles. 

A future version of this lightweight profile may include a RESTful SOS binding in order to provide an 
additional simplified means for accessing SOS servers.

2.3 Import of Sensor Data Archives into the SOS 

2.3.1 Introduction 

Within various projects and initiatives many existing (sensor) datasets are used which cover time peri-
ods in the past. However, these datasets are currently only available in form of existing files (e.g. com-
ma separated values) or local databases. In order to integrate these datasets into systems which make 
use of distributed SDI components, it is necessary to provide the existing sensor data though standard-
ized web-based interfaces, i.e. the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) (OGC, 2007a and OGC, 
2012). The following section investigates how the import of these sensor data archives into SOS in-
stances may be facilitated to turn into a task manageable for non-IT experts.  

The current implementation of the SOS Import tool was developed in the course of the EO2HEAVEN 
project and is available online at: https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/SensorWeb/SosImporter 

2.3.2 Challenges and Questions 

Currently, a significant amount of knowledge is required when setting up an SOS instance filled by ex-
isting sensor data. Usually the users have three options for publishing their sensor data: 

 Usage of the transactional SOS operations: In this case the user has to convert the data into 
the Observations and Measurements (O&M) data model (ISO 19156:2011 and OGC, 2011a) 
such that the data can be inserted into the SOS instance through standardized operations. 
However, a domain expert should not be obliged to spend the effort to understand the O&M 
model before being able to map the existing sensor data to the O&M model. 

 Direct insertion of sensor data into SOS databases: In this case the existing data is transmitted 
into the database of the SOS, e.g. by means of SQL statements in case of a relational data-
base. However, this approach is neither suitable for non-IT-experts. Users should not be 
obliged to spend time to understand the data model of a proprietary SOS database, familiarize 
with SQL and create according SQL statements.  

Note: The data model of the database “behind” the SOS interface is not standardized.  

 Connection of existing databases with SOS instances: In this case a SOS implementation 
would be customized in order to use a specific database as source for observation data. But as 
this approach would require significant programming work, it is not suited to non-IT-experts as 
well. 

The following section describes an approach that facilitates the import of sensor data into SOS instanc-
es. The envisaged solution is a wizard tool that guides users through the import process of sensor data. 
The users are able to describe the structure of the existing data through a graphical user interface such 
that the wizard is able to automatically create a mapping of the existing datasets into the 
SOS/O&M/SensorML data models, respectively.  

After specifying the structure of the datasets, the wizard pushes the sensor data into the SOS instance 
in a final step. 

2.3.3 Results 

The current version relies upon comma-separated values (CSV) files as the input for the application. 
CSV files are a common approach to represent tabular data in a textual format. Outside the Sensor 
Web, they are often used to exchange sensor data. The structure of CSV files has never been stand-
ardized, though there are some guidelines (Shafranovich, 2005): 

 Columns are separated with a consistent character and rows are separated with newlines. 

 Traditionally, a comma delimits columns. 



OGC Best Practices for SWE: Provision of Observations through an OGC SOS 

 
 

 

17 
 

 

 In countries where decimal numbers are already separated with commas, other characters, like 
the semicolon or colon, are taken. 

 Fields that contain a special character (e.g. a column separator or a newline) are enclosed by 
two quote symbols. 

 Often, double quotes are used here. If a field includes a quote symbol, it is escaped by placing 
another quote symbol in front (e.g. “”best“” for “best”). 

 Sometimes, comment characters (e.g. #) may appear which escape a whole line.  

It is assumed that the content of the CSV file, measurements and sensor metadata, is stored column-
wisely. For example, it could look like this: 

01.01.2011; Sensor1; 1,3 

01.01.2011; Sensor2; 2,5 

02.01.2011; Sensor1; 1,7 

02.01.2011; Sensor2; 2,2 

… 

At least one column of measurements should be included in the file. The results of measurements can 
be numeric, positive integers (counts), Booleans (true or false) or textual. For numeric values (e.g. 2.3), 
thousands and decimal marks have to be specified in addition. This is necessary since regional differ-
ences exist for these separators. For example, in Germany a decimal comma is used, whereas the 
United Kingdom and the United States use a decimal point.  

In addition to the measurement column, there can be one or more date and time column in arbitrary 
format. Date and time could be split over several columns (e.g. date in one, time in another one). More-
over, date and time need not be complete to be compliant to OGC SWE standards. For instance, there 
are only times and no dates, or the time zone is missing. Analogously, this applies to sensor locations, 
too, in case they were provided within a CSV file. The format in which sensor positions are described 
can be arbitrary, so patterns for converting them into a standardized positional scheme have to be 
specified. Position data could be available partitioned in several columns (e.g. latitude in one, longitude 
in the other one) and, again, need not be complete. For example, only latitude and longitude are given 
and neither height, nor a spatial reference system. Also, the units of latitude, longitude and height might 
be missing.  

It is assumed that within one column the same format is used (e.g. comma as a decimal separator or 
throughout the same date and time pattern). Other values than these (e.g. NULL-values or headings) 
will be ignored. Further columns in the CSV file might include units of measure, observed properties, 
sensors or features of interest. It is not very likely that URIs can be found here, so these columns will be 
interpreted as names. In the scope of the work described in this document, only stationary (not mobile) 
and in-situ (not remote) sensors are taken into account. 

The application makes use of the wizard design pattern which guides the user through different steps. 
These and their purposes are briefly characterized in the table below. Screenshots of all steps are 
shown below in Figure 2-1 to Figure 2-15.

Step Function 

Step 1 Choose a CSV file from the file system to publish in a SOS instance or specify a CSV 
file on a FTP server that shall be (automatically/regularly) fetched by the SOS importer. 

Step 2 Provide a preview of the CSV file and select settings for parsing (e.g. which character is 
used for separating columns) 

Step 3 Display the CSV file in tabular format and assign metadata to each column (e.g. indi-
cate that the second column consists of measured values). Offer customizable settings 
for parsing (e.g. for date/time patterns) 

Step 4 Solve ambiguities: In case of more than one date/time, feature of interest, observed 
property, unit of measurement, sensor identifier or position has been identified in step 
3, select the correct associations to the according measured value columns (e.g. state 
that date/time in column 1 belongs to the measured values in column 3 and date/time in 
column 2 belongs to the measured values in column 4). When there is exactly one ap-
pearance of a certain type, automatically assign this type to all measured values 

Step 5 Check available metadata for completeness and ask the user to add information in case 
something is missing (e.g. time zone, EPSG-code for positions) 

Step 6 When there is no metadata of a particular type present in the CSV file (e.g. sensor id), 
let the user provide this information (e.g. name and URI of the observed property or 
sensor, missing position data) 

Step 7 Enter the URL of a Sensor Observation Service where measurements and sensor 
metadata in the CSV file shall be uploaded to 

Step 8 Assemble all information from previous steps and convert the CSV file into XML files 
according to OGC’s Observations and Measurements and SensorML specifications. 
Register sensors and insert observations at the given Sensor Observation Service us-
ing the Transactional Profile of the SOS specification. Show the progress and provide a 
report of errors and success 

Table 2 Different steps of the application 

Note that steps 4 to 6 can sometimes be skipped in case of CSV files of a particular structure. Also, 
their functionality is split up in the application according to the type of metadata they represent (a - 
date/time, b - features of interest, observed properties, units of measurement, sensors, c - positions).  

In the first step, the user selects the file (in this version a CSV file), which contains the observation data 
set that shall be published. This can either be a CSV file on the local file system (Figure 2-1) or a file on 
an FTP server (Figure 2-2). In case the user chooses a file on a FTP server, the SOS Importer can be 
configured to automatically check in regular intervals if the file has been updated. Furthermore, it is 
possible to provide regular expressions for the file name so that the SOS Importer can also handle 
those cases in which new CSV files are created for certain time periods (e.g. new CSV files created 
every day that contain the creation date in their file name).

After this, the general settings for parsing the file need to be set (column separator, comment indicator, 
text qualifier and decimal separator). Furthermore the number of lines at the beginning of the file that 
shall be ignored can be specified (e.g. for ignoring headers in CSV files) (Figure 2-3).

Figure 2-3: Selecting settings for parsing the CSV file 

In the next steps the content of the different columns needs to be defined. Depending on the type of da-
ta contained in a column further information needs to be set by the user. For example: 

 If a column contains data and time, the according format (e.g. dd/MM/yy HH:mm) needs to be 
described (Figure 2-4) 

 If a column contains observed values the data type (e.g. numeric, Boolean, category) need to 
be set and if applicable also thousands and decimal separators (Figure 2-5)

Figure 2-5: Describing the content of the columns (measured value) 

If multiple columns with the same content type are present in a CSV file, according associations must 
be created, for example 

 If there are multiple feature of interest columns it must be defined which feature of interest col-
umn belongs to which measured value column (Figure 2-6) 

 If there are multiple timestamp columns it must be defined which time stamp column belongs to 
which measured value column 

 If there are multiple unit of measurement columns it must be defined which unit of measure-
ment column belongs to which measured value column

Figure 2-6: Creating associations between measured values and features of interest 

If there is missing metadata for a time stamp column (e.g. time zone) the user has to provide this infor-
mation in the next step (Figure 2-7).

Figure 2-7: Adding missing metadata (missing time zone) 

In case certain metadata elements are missing within the positions of sensor observations, the next 
step (Figure 2-8) can be used for inserting the according information (e.g. height, EPSG code of the 
reference system). 

 
Figure 2-8: Adding missing position information (EPSG code and height) 

In some cases, certain metadata elements (e.g. names of measurement stations, units of measure-
ment, names of sensors, positions) may be missing completely. However, as they are required by the 
SWE standards, the import tool provides a means for manually adding or even automatically generating 
such metadata elements. 

If no identifiers for the geographic features the measurements are associated to are provided, the im-
port tool offers the automatic generation of feature of interest identifiers. In the example below the iden-
tifiers are generated from the coordinates of the measurements (Figure 2-9).

Figure 2-9: Automatically generating feature of interest identifiers 

In case no unit of measurement is provided for the observed values, it can be manually added as a 
metadata element (Figure 2-10).

27 
 

 

 
Figure 2-10: Manually adding information about the unit of measurement 

If the CSV file does not contain the identifiers of the sensors which have generated the observation da-
ta, these identifiers can be added through the import tool (Figure 2-11). This can be achieved either au-
tomatically or manually.

28 
 

 

 
Figure 2-11: Creating sensor identifiers 

In case the CSV file does not provide any spatial reference for the measured values, the menu below 
offers the possibility to enter positions manually. The user has the option to enter the coordinates 
through a map view (Figure 2-12) or through text fields (Figure 2-13).

Figure 2-13: Setting the positions of the features of interest through text fields 

After all necessary data and metadata elements have been entered, the SOS instance to which the 
sensor observations shall be published must be determined (Figure 2-14). In addition the user is able to 
store the configuration of the import in an external file. Later on this can be used for parameterising an 
automatically running import tool that regularly checks for new available data and subsequently pushes 
these data sets into a SOS server.

ful (Figure 2-15).

2.3.4 Summary and Conclusion 

The presented tool is a significant step forward to facilitate the practical application of the SOS. By of-
fering an easy-to-use approach for publishing sensor data through a SOS, the acceptance of the SOS 
can be significantly increased. Furthermore it is a valuable tool for end users to integrate their sensor 
data into a SWE-compliant system. 

The current version demonstrates that the general concept of an import tool for legacy data sets into 
the SOS is feasible. It may already be used for publishing existing data sets with limited background 
knowledge about the SWE standards.  

However, further work will be necessary, especially covering the following aspects: 

 Better hiding of underlying SWE concepts: the current version of the import tool still confronts 
the user with several SWE-specific terms (e.g. feature of interest); instead the next version 
should be further optimized for avoiding the use of SWE-specific terms and replace them by 
more natural language explanations 

 More flexible support of data structures: the current version was developed on the basis of a set 
of sample files that were used within the EO2HEAVEN project. For the future a more flexible 
support of CSV files (i.e. different ways of how data is organized) is desirable. In addition, fur-
ther data formats (e.g. Excel files) should be supported, as well.
