OWS-6 Testbed  
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 

collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver Engineering 

Reports and Chnage Requests into the OGC Specification Program, where they are 

formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of 

technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing interoperability problems 

posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include 

test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - 

all designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC 

standards. 

 

In April 2008, the OGC issued a call for sponsors for an OGC Web Services, Phase 6 (OWS-

6) Testbed activity. The activity completed in June 2009. There is a series of on-line 

demonstrations available here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/pub/www/ows6/index.html  

The OWS-6 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 

requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 

recommended to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-6 initiative be organized around 

the following threads:  

 

1. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)  

 

2. Geo Processing Workflow (GPW)  

 

3. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM)  

 

4. Decision Support Services (DSS)  

 

5. Compliance Testing (CITE)  

 

The OWS-6 sponsoring organizations were:  

 

 U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)  
 

 Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD)  
 

 GeoConnections - Natural Resources Canada

5 OWS-6 SWE PulseNet™ Engineering Report Overview 

This summary portion of this report contains the following sections: 

• Achievements 

• PulseNET™ Enhancements 

• Lessons Learned 

• Recommendations 

A significant portion of this report references our principle deliverable document for 

SWE, the CCSI Engineering Report (09-007). Rather than duplicate information, the 

appropriate sections of that report are referenced in this summary report.

6 Achievements 

Northrop Grumman was responsible for the development of Common Chemical, 

Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) sensor (CCSI) interfaces within the OGC’s 

SWE architecture. The CBRN sensors interface with SWE services through an 

intermediary web service called the Sensor Interface Service (SIS). Using the SIS, the 

SWE SOS, SAS, and SPS services provide clients access to gather information and 

communicate with the CRBN sensors. An overview of the SWE architecture is described 

in section 7 of the CCSI ER (09-007). 

To describe the CBRN sensors and their data, we developed SensorML and O & M for 

CCSI sensors.  eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) transforms were 

then developed to convert CCSI sensor descriptions and messages (coming from the 

CCSI emulator provided by JPEO-CBD) into SensorML and O & M.   

To visualize and interactively query the sensors within the SWE architecture, Northrop 

Grumman provided the PULSENet™ Client, a .NET 2.0 based client application utilizing 

Skyline’s TerraExplorer Pro v5.1 3D visualization product. The PULSENet™ Client was 

configured to interact with the CBRN sensors through the SWE interfaces developed by 

Compusult, then used in the final SWE demonstration. 

To demonstrate the CCSI capability, Northrop Grumman provided a recorded video of 

the PULSENet™ client interacting with CCSI sensors, which was incorporated into the 

overall CCSI movie. 

Northrop Grumman collaborated with the other participants in the SWE thread: 

Compusult (Robert Thomas, Bob Grace, and Angela Amirault), who provided the SWE 

services that utilized the SIS; the sponsors, NGA (Dave Wesloh) and JPEO-CBD (Claude 

Speed, Tom Swanson, and Cheryl Putnam), who also provided the CRBN emulator; and 

the SWE thread lead architect, Ingo Simonis (International Geospatial Services Institute 

(iGSI) GmbH).  

A timeline of accomplishments throughout the OWS-6 period is summarized below. 

Month, Year Accomplishment 

Oct. 2008 Scott Fairgrieve attended the OWS-6 kickoff meeting Oct 14-16, 

2008 at George Mason University. Worked with Compusult and 

the CCSI sponsor to clarify roles on the CCSI thread.

6 This document summarizes the work done by Northrop Grumman with the 
PulseNet™ product on the SWE thread of OWS-6 in 2008-09. 

 

Month, Year Accomplishment 

Nov. 2008 Began developing an API for the Sensor Interface Service (SIS), 

which is a SOAP/WSDL-based web service that acts as a CCSI 

Client and will allow SWE service interfaces to more easily work 

with CCSI sensors. 

Developed the outline for the CCSI-SWE engineering report. 

The SWE client is available for the other participants to use. 

Dec. 2008 Wrote XSLT to translate CCSI readings into O & M format, and 

implemented the Sensor Interface Service (SIS).  We provided a 

sample SIS which Compusult has begun using to develop their 

SOS and SPS interfaces. 

Jan. 2009 Submitted the draft CCSI-SWE Engineering Report for review. 

Began to use the CRBN sensor emulator provided by JPEO-CBD 

with the SIS. 

Feb. 2009 Completed initial delivery of the Sensor Interface Service (SIS) 

implementation and added methods to support SPS and SAS 

functionality. SIS was improved to make it more robust. 

Provided input to the proposed CCSI-SWE demonstration 

scenario that includes our developed services and PULSENet 

client. 

Mar. 2009 Our contribution to the CCSI video was delivered per instructions 

for composition by Robert Thomas/Compusult into the final 

video.   

Scott Fairgrieve updated the PULSENet Client to better handle 

the Compusult SWE services, provided input to Compusult to 

improve their SWE service implementations, and improved 

support for CCSI maintenance channel messages. 

A potential issue was identified concerning the SIS and SWE 

Client security interface (SAML, XAMCL), which is still 

incomplete.

Month, Year Accomplishment 

Apr. 2009 Completed the SWE CCSI SIS, which was integrated with 

Compusult’s SWE service implementations and recorded with 

other partners for the OWS-6 demonstration video. 

Delivered a final version of the SWE-CCSI Engineering Report 

(# 09-007). 

The SWE Client security interface (SAML, XAMCL) was 

incomplete.  We made several attempts to work with con terra to 

utilize the secure services from GPW in the SWE Client. 

We prepared to participate in the OWS-6 webinar on 29 April, 

but it was canceled by the OGC. 

May 2009 Delivered this report.

7 PULSENet™ Enhancements 

Primarily a reusable component that works with SWE services, minor enhancements 

were made to the PULSENet™ client for CBRN sensors and the Compusult SPS.  

The SIS development consisted of defining and developing the SIS to communicate with 

CCSI sensors. Some of the specific enhancements to the SIS implemented for CCSI 

sensors are: 

 Converted CCSI identifiers to a URN according to OGC’s naming conventions 

 READGS, Status, and Maintenance channels of sensor observations mapped to O & 

M 

 CCSI ALERTS channel converted to both O & M and SAS Alert 

 CCSI commands were converted to SPS input messages 

Section 10 of the CCSI ER (09-007) provides the technical detail of the SIS 

implementation of CCSI. 

8 Lessons Learned 

Challenges in the SWE CCSI architecture and testing are described in section 12 of the 

CCSI ER (09-007). 

9 Recommendations for future work 

The recommended future work for the SWE CCSI is described in section 13 of the CCSI 

ER (09-007).
