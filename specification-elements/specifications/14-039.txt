OGC® Testbed 10 Aviation Human Factor Based Portrayal of 
Digital NOTAMs ER 

Abstract 

This activity is part of OGC Testbed 10. The aviation thread was focused on developing 
and demonstrating the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) and 
the Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM), building on the work accomplished in 
prior testbeds to advance the applications of OGC Web Services standards in next 
generation air traffic management systems to support European and US aviation 
modernization programs. 

This document provides the result of the Testbed 10 to assess the compliance between the 
OGC standards and the guidelines provided by the SAE1 in their latest published 
document regarding portraying of NOTAMs. Specifically, the Human Based Portrayal of 
DNOTAM work attempts to fulfill the high level requirements identified in the OGC 
Testbed-10 RFQ Annex B2. 

The purpose of this investigation was to analyze the recommendations of the SAE comity 
and to evaluate the feasibility of their application using OGC standards for portraying, 
namely the Symbology Encoding standard, version 1.1.

Background 

In 2013, the SAE Aviation Committee published a pre-final version of an Aerospace 
Recommended Practice (ARP) tackling the representation of certain critical categories of 
NOTAMs in the flight deck of an aircraft. This ARP is constructed using the FAA 
guidelines provided by the Human Factor Design Standards (HFDS), and aims at 
providing guidelines for the representation of a sub set of NOTAMs that are the most 
safety critical, and the ones that affect the efficiency of airspaces the most. 

                                                

1 SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, is a U.S.-based, 
globally active professional association and standards organization for engineering 
professionals in various industries. Principal emphasis is placed on transport industries 
such as automotive, aerospace, and commercial vehicles.

The ARP is split up in two main sections. The first section provides general 
recommendations and requirements for display of NOTAMs on the flight deck on board. 
The second sections addresses the specific categories of NOTAMs mentioned above, 
with examples of what would be the best representation to enhance situation awareness.  

In this investigation, we focused our attention on the second part of the ARP, taking the 
NOTAM categories one by one and attempting to create SE rules to abide the 
recommendations of the SAE. We also have a look at Digital NOTAM 2.0 events and 
formulate a set of guidelines as to how they should be structured for compliance with the 
AIXM 5.1 temporality model and SE. Results and obstacles met are documented here. 

 

Conclusions and findings 

The NOTAM categories that have been deemed the most safety critical and affecting 
airspace efficiency the most are the following: 

 Runway Closure 

 Taxiway Closure 

 Displaced Threshold 

 Runway Shortened 

 Temporary Flight Restriction 

 Change of IAP (Instrument Approach Procedure) 

For each of these categories, the SAE provided a visualization example to illustrate the 
recommendations provided. We illustrate our results with examples using the Luciad 
Aviation Client, to compare these to the recommendations provided by SAE-G10. 

Here are our findings for each category: 

Runway and Taxiway closure  

The SE rule was made possible using the ManoeuvringAreaAvailabilty property of the 
DNOTAM as a filter. When its value is CLOSED, X’s are drawn on the closed runway or 
taxiway. Attention needs to be paid on the client side; varying pixel density from one 
display to another may result on loss of readability. A solution could be to add a property 
in the SE standard to take the pixel density into account. Also, the depiction of X’s could 
be done in various ways: one could be to use WellKnownName property, but it may 
create interoperability issues. The other would be to use external graphics that contains 
the cross pattern as an image. 



OGC 14-039

Displaced Threshold 

The SE rule was constructed using the RunwayMarking feature in the AIXM 5.1 data 
model. To ensure that the correct information is conveyed by the DNOTAM, it must 
supply 2 pieces of information in the DNOTAM itself:  

1. Any existing RunwayMarkings that are no longer visible, should be included in 
the DNOTAM with an empty geometry component. It is important here to include 
their identifier. 

2. Any new RunwayMarkings must be defined with full geo-referenced geometry, a 
unique id, and a reference to the Runway they are on. 

These steps are required to ensure that the AIXM 5.1 temporality model can correctly be 
used when applying Displaced Threshold NOTAM events. 

Runway Shortened 

The SE rule for Runway Shortened was achieved using the ManoeuvringAreaAvailabilty 
property of the DNOTAM. During the course of the research, we found there was no 
obvious way of distinguishing a Shortened Runway from a Closed Runway, based on the 
properties available in the AIXM 5.1 data model.  

We offer two potential solutions to overcome this problem: Either we supply the closed 
section of the runway as a new RunwayElement, or we divide the baseline Runway into 
small segments. 

Temporary Flight Restriction 

The SE rule was created based on on the AirspaceActivation property of the DNOTAM. 
This style was split up into two components. The first component is a thick red outline. 
The other component describes a red hatched pattern. To make sure the hatched pattern 
appears on the inside of the airspace, we use the perpendicularOffset attribute of the 
LineSymbolizer.  

Change of Instrument Approach Procedure 

As the time of redaction of this document, IAP change is not supported by the DNOTAM 
standard. Tackling this has been postponed to future work. 

 Overall, the Symbology Encoding standard is deemed exhaustive enough to address the 
recommendations and requirements of the SAE-G10 ARP6467. Addtitions may need to 
be made to the AIXM and DNOTAM standards, to ensure that the features required for 
SE rule making are mandatory in the content of the DNOTAM.

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

The scope of this OGC® document is to tackle the SAE-G10 recommendations and 
requirements for the human driven portrayal of NOTAMs and to attempt to produce 
SLD/SE rules to abide those requirements. 

The general requirements and recommendations concerning the display of NOTAMs and 
the crew interaction with NOTAMs are listed in the first section of this document. 

The recommendations that are specific to certain types of NOTAMs, together with the 
attempted SLD/SE rules creation to abide them are provided in the second part of the 
document. 

This main part of this report, concerning the recommendations for a set of given 
NOTAMs does not have the objective to be exhaustive and to tackle all different types of 
NOTAMs. It is designed for the reader to easily connect it with the SAE-G10 document. 

This OGC® document is applicable to the portrayal of DNOTAMs according to the SAE-
G10 recommendations.

1.4 Future work 

At the time this report was produced, DNOTAMs to describe IAP change did not exist, 
therefore SLD/SE rules could be created to address the SAE-G10 recommendation. This 
will need to be further investigated when IAP change are supported by the DNOTAM 
standard.

4 Testbed-10 Report on Aviation Human Factor Based Portrayal of Digital 
NOTAMs overview 

At the time where this report is being written, the SAE committee is working on a 
document to provide human factor based requirements and recommendations for 
portrayal of digital NOTAMs. This document first provides general guidance for 
displaying NOTAMs on a cockpit display, and then tackles a certain number of specific 
digital NOTAMs and the rules to abide when displaying them. 

The purpose of this report is to assess the feasibility of abiding the SAE-G10 
recommendations and requirements using the OGC standard for Symbology Encoding. 
This document also aims at providing end users’ (pilots’) feedback on the relevance of 
those applied guidance. 

The approach of this analysis is to list all requirements and recommendations from the 
different standards document, especially the SAE-G10 - Human Factors Minimum 
Requirements and Recommendations for the Flight Deck Display of Data Linked Notices 
to Airmen. Once they are listed, an analysis is made to evaluate the feasibility of 
addressing them using Symbology Encoding. 

The end purpose is to provide, if needed, guidance for the SLD/SE standards in order to 
comply with SAE-G10 ARP 6467.

5 SAE-G10 General Guidance for Flight Deck Display of Digital NOTAMs 

The following requirements and recommendations are general and do not concern any 
specific NOTAMs, they are given here as reference for readers and to give an idea of the 
perspective of the document. 

The following table presents the general requirements and recommendations for display 
of digital NOTAMs. The ones marked with “r” are recommendations; those marked with 
“R” are requirements. The requirement/recommendation is formulated in the next 
column, and the rationale behind the requirement/recommendation is given in the third 
column. 

The recommendations and requirements as shown in the following tables are direct 
quotations of the SAE-G10 ARP 6467. 3 

5.1 Display of NOTAMs 

Table 1 - General requirements and recommendations for NOTAMs display 

Type Id Content Rationale 

R R1 

The gNOTAM shall be comprised 
of elements (e.g., icons; markings; 
symbols; labels; information 
coding such as the use of color, 
bold or crossed out text) that allow 
for efficient and accurate 
interpretation by the intended 
users[…]. 

A picture is worth a thousand 
words, thus the graphical 
depiction of text information can 
speed user comprehension, save 
“real estate” on already crowded 
displays, and provide flight crews 
with critical just-in-time 
information. 

R R2 

At a minimum, the gNOTAM 
shall indicate the subject cited in 
the associated text NOTAM and 
that a NOTAM exists that 
identifies the change in status of 
that subject […]. 

Providing the user, at a 
minimum, with an indication of 
the subject and that it has a 
NOTAM associated with it in the 
gNOTAM enables the user to 
comprehend the gNOTAM even 
if not all parts of the NOTAM are 
depicted […]. 

R R3 

The system shall display 
gNOTAMs accurately in (shape 
and content) […]. 

Providing users with an accurate 
graphical depiction will help 
ensure that the gNOTAM 
provides a usable supplement to 
the text NOTAM. 

                                                

3 Quotations from the document are either partial or total. If a quote is partial, the symbol […] indicates that a part of 
the original text is missing (usually some practical example). 



OGC 14-039 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 9 
 

r R4 

The gNOTAM should include all 
details from the text NOTAM. If 
there are too many details to 
display on the gNOTAM, then 
display the additional detail(s) that 
are most relevant for that NOTAM 
type. 

Providing users with a gNOTAM 
that includes as many of the 
relevant details as possible will 
support users’ full 
comprehension of the current 
status of the NOTAMs in the 
route of flight and should reduce 
the negative impact on user 
workload and heads down time. 

R R5 

NOTAM display system shall 
include an indication (e.g., an 
icon, symbol) that additional 
details are available for the 
gNOTAM, but not displayed. 

Letting users know that 
additional NOTAM details are 
present but not displayed reduces 
the likelihood that they will miss 
important information. 

R R6 

The system shall differentiate 
between gNOTAMs that are 
currently active from those that 
will become active in the future 
(e.g., at the time of the aircraft’s 
scheduled arrival, within 24 hours, 
at some other time in the future). 

Differentiating between currently 
active NOTAMs and those which 
will become active in the future 
will improve strategic flight 
planning […]. 

r R7 

The flight deck display should, if 
permissible by regulation, provide 
an integrated depiction that shows 
the user’s position (e.g., route-of-
flight, own-ship) relative to the 
gNOTAM. 

Providing the users with their 
position relative to the gNOTAM 
helps the user plan and efficiently 
execute their planned route of 
flight. 

r R8 

If providing a gNOTAM on more 
than one of the same 
manufacturer’s displays on the 
flight deck, the gNOTAM should 
be depicted consistently. This is 
particularly important if the two 
displays are part of installed 
systems.  Deviations may be 
required to take into 
consideration the advantages 
and limitations of the particular 
display and application, but 
users should be trained on the 
difference. 

Users should see gNOTAMs 
displayed consistently across the 
same manufacturer’s displays on 
the flight deck to ensure accurate 
interpretation of the meaning of 
the gNOTAM […]. 

r R9 If a designer opts to superimpose gNOTAMs over baseline data, the 
gNOTAM should be 

Providing users with a gNOTAM 
over all baseline products where 
it appears will enable users to use 



OGC 14-039 

10 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

superimposed over all baseline 
data products that contain that 
NOTAM’s subject and upon a 
baseline product on which the 
gNOTAM could be easily viewed 
[…]. 

the gNOTAM in each and every 
place where they might 
determine it is most useful and 
clear. 

R R10 

The system display shall show all 
available gNOTAMs when 
multiple gNOTAMs exist for a 
given baseline data product. 

Help speed processing of 
information and provide a more 
comprehensive mental map, 
which may increase situation 
awareness.  

r R11 

If a single baseline data product 
contains multiple references to a 
subject, the NOTAM display 
system should insert the 
gNOTAM in every place where 
that subject exists[…]. 

Providing users with a gNOTAM 
in every place where the subject 
appears will always provide the 
users with the information 
anytime they need it. This is 
preferable to having the 
designers try and predict this 
or assuming the user will not 
need it at a certain time in 
flight. 

r R12 

The flight deck display should 
follow accepted human factors 
standards regarding visibility, 
legibility, readability of display 
subjects to ensure that gNOTAMs 
are readable during flight 
operations in all lighting 
conditions. Display subjects 
relevant to the flight operations 
environment may include 
luminance contrast, font type, font 
size, chromaticity differences, 
character spacing, word spacing, 
line spacing, and resolution. 

Users should be provided with 
gNOTAMs that are readable 
during flight operations in all 
lighting conditions in order to 
properly interpret the 
information. Visibility, legibility, 
and readability of information in 
the flight deck under normal 
operations includes challenges 
such as: glare, brightness/night 
vision, noise, vibration, etc. 

r R13 

The graphical depiction of a 
NOTAM type should be easily 
identified as being different from 
the NOTAM categories baseline 
data. 

Making it clear where there are 
differences between the baseline 
data and the new status of the 
subject will assist users in 
recognizing and processing that 
information.

baseline subject identified in the 
NOTAM (e.g., the part of the 
runway actually being closed) in 
relation to other baseline data 
(e.g., other airport subjects that 
appear on the airport diagram). 
There are many ways to 
accomplish this including 
superimposing the graphical 
NOTAM over a baseline data 
product such as the airport 
diagram or moving map. 

aeronautical information (e.g., 
moving map, instrument 
approach chart or airport 
diagram) rather than on an 
individual, separate plate, chart 
or diagram without any context 
will enable the users to 
understand the information being 
conveyed in context with other 
information and not require the 
users to review the new 
information in a new format […]. 

R R15 

The flight deck display system 
shall present NOTAMs in a way 
that does not obscure flight 
relevant information that cannot 
per regulation be obscured and 
that does not permanently obscure 
other flight relevant information 
[…]. 

Ensuring that gNOTAMs do not 
permanently obscure flight 
relevant information will enable 
users to remain aware of the 
current operational condition. 

 

R R16 

The user shall be provided with 
explanatory information (e.g., a 
legend, key) that describes the 
meanings of icons, symbols, 
colors, etc. for gNOTAMs.  For 
example, this may take the form of 
an on-line user guide, external 
electronic help file, hard copy 
manual, wizard, video tutorial, or 
other form. 

Providing users with a key or 
legend is critical for 
comprehension of icons, 
symbols, colors, etc. of 
gNOTAMs. 

5.2 Crew interaction with NOTAMs

Type Id Content Rationale 

r 
 

When displaying multiple text-based 
NOTAMs, the display should be easily 
navigable by users. For example, make it 
clear when users have reached the end of 
a list; indicate how many NOTAMs are in 
the list; provide navigation buttons for 
moving forward or backward by page; 
and if the full text of the NOTAM is not 
displayed on the screen provide scroll 
bars. 

Providing users with an easy way to 
navigate through the list of text-
based NOTAMs will ensure that the 
users can find what they are looking 
for when they need it and ensure 
their operational performance is not 
degraded. 



OGC 14-039

R 
 

The flight deck display shall differentiate 
NOTAM information from other data 
linked information. 

Providing users with a way to 
differentiate between NOTAMs and 
other types of data linked 
information will enable the users to 
fully utilize all information received 
over data link. 

R 
 

When data linked NOTAMs are available 
on the flight deck, text and gNOTAMs 
shall be available for display upon user 
request. 

Because text and gNOTAMs are 
unlikely to be displayed 
continuously, it is possible that the 
list of NOTAMs will not be visible 
all the time […]. 

r 
 

The flight deck display should indicate 
when a text NOTAMs is also available in 
graphical form (e.g., include an icon with 
the text NOTAM that indicates that a 
graphic is available). 

Providing users with an indication 
that a gNOTAM is available 
improves the users’ chances of not 
missing a gNOTAM which might 
improve understanding of the 
NOTAM in less time and result in a 
more efficient flight.  It is also a 
critical component of ensuring that 
the mixed use environment does not 
create inaccurate assumptions by 
users of what gNOTAMs exist. 

r 
 

The flight deck display should provide 
users with immediate access to the text 
NOTAM from the gNOTAM. 

Ensuring that users have a quick and 
intuitive way to access the complete 
text NOTAM from the gNOTAM 
may prevent users from missing 
details of the NOTAM. 

r 
 

The system should provide feedback to 
users regarding system status and system 
errors.  For example, the system should 
communicate that it was unable to load 
text or gNOTAMs, that there are delays in 
rendering gNOTAMs, or there are 
connectivity issues. 

Providing users with feedback 
regarding system status and errors 
will enhance comprehension and 
reduce user errors […]. 

r 
 

The system should provide users with the 
capability to manage NOTAMs. 
Examples of NOTAM capabilities include 
display preferences (e.g., use a mix of 
upper and lower case letters; show 
NOTAMs in FAA domestic, ICAO, or 
plain text format; display local vs. UTC 
time; information coding), and 
management functions such as sorting, 
filtering, grouping or categorizing, 

A well-designed graphical user 
interface could enable flight crews 
with a means to manipulate NOTAM 
information so that it can be 
effectively comprehended […].

searching, and prioritizing.  

r 
 

The system should provide a means (e.g., 
a menu) to clearly inform users what 
managing capabilities (e.g., sorting, 
filtering, grouping/categorizing, 
prioritization, translation to different 
formats) are available. 

[…] Enable [users] to take advantage 
of the positive aspects for managing 
NOTAMs.  These capabilities 
provide users with a way to mitigate 
the negative effects of volume and 
clutter. 

r 
 

The system should provide a means for 
users to select which NOTAM 
capabilities they apply to their route of 
flight.4 

Providing users with the ability to set 
their own preference settings before 
they operate their flight will provide 
them with the optimal use of this 
data.  Users should also be provided 
with a means to change these 
preference settings as they see fit. 

r 
 

The system should provide information to 
users regarding what NOTAM 
capabilities and settings have been 
selected. 

Unfiltered NOTAMs can overload 
the flight crew with large volumes of 
unneeded, extraneous information.  
Filters applied by the flight crews 
can mitigate this situation.  Providing 
users with the indications of what 
NOTAM management capabilities 
are being applied/displayed will 
allow the user to effectively manage 
the NOTAM information displayed. 

R 
 

The system shall provide an indication to 
users that changes have been made to 
their current NOTAM list. 

Providing users with an indication 
that changes have been made to 
current NOTAMs will help them 
remain aware of changes that may 
impact their flight. 

R 
 

The system shall provide users with a 
time stamp indicating when the latest 
update to the NOTAM information was 
received. 

Providing users with an indication 
when the latest NOTAM information 
was received will provide the users 
with an indication of the temporality 
of the information displayed. 

R 
 

The developer shall provide the user with 
current documentation to reference the 
subjects (e.g., components, functions, 
common tasks, disclaimers) of the system 

Users must be provided with an 
official current document in order to 
fully understand how to use the 
system in case questions or 

                                                

4 There is inherent risk in allowing users to turn off all or some subset of NOTAMs.  For example, allowing users to 
turn off runway closure NOTAMs creates the risk of users not recalling that this NOTAM type has been turned off and 
then inadvertently landing on a closed runway.  User-selectable options should be carefully considered before being 
included as a NOTAM management capability.

6 Guidance for Specific NOTAMs 

Along with the general guidance for displaying graphical NOTAMs, the SAE-G10 
document provides a set of recommendations for displaying specific types of NOTAMs. 

The specific NOTAMs addressed by the SAE comity are listed below: 

 Runway closure, 

 Displaced threshold runway (for landing), 

 Runway shortened, 

 Taxiway closure, 

 TFR, 

 Changes to an instrument approach procedure (IAP). 

The NOTAMs categories selected have been selected by the SAE Comity by researching 
which NOTAM categories resulted in the most frequent accidents and incidents.  

For those specific NOTAM, a deeper analysis will be performed to evaluate the 
feasibility of translating the associated recommendations into Symbology Encoding rules. 
For each NOTAM, the following items are presented: Content of the recommendation, 
Rationale behind the recommendation5, Portrayal proposed by SAE, Translation of 
recommendation into Symbology Encoding rule, issues encountered and proposed 
solution. 

6.1 Runway Closure 

6.1.1 Recommendation 

The gNOTAM of a closed runway should indicate that the entire runway is closed, 
ensuring that users will be able to see that the runway is closed regardless of the scale of 
the display.  One way to accomplish this is to superimpose X’s over the entire length of 
the closed runway rather than just at the end of the runway. 

6.1.2 Rationale 

If users can recognize that an entire runway is closed based upon the graphical 
depiction, then they are less likely to miss the closed runway even if they are viewing the 
runway on a scale that only shows part of the runway.  

                                                

5 The recommendations and associated rationales are direct quotations from the SAE-G10 ARP6467.

6.1.3 Portrayal proposal 

 

Figure 1 - SAE-G10 proposal for Closed Runway gNOTAMs display 

6.1.4 Symbology Encoding 

The main requirement for symbology encoding for the Runway Closed NOTAM is to 
have X's appear superimposed over the length of a closed runway. 
 
A Runway Closed DNOTAM generally contains a reference to the closed runway in the 
form of a TEMPDELTA timeslice. An intuitive approach to this problem would be to use 
a Point Symbolizer to style icons along the runway itself. Unfortunately, an AIXM 5.1 
feature does not contain a set of points running through the center of the runway.  
 
The superimposition of X’s can instead be defined as a new rule using a 
PolygonSymbolizer with a specific fill pattern. The OGC filter for this rule requires the 
runway operational status to be closed, and relies on client support for 
WellKnownSymbol "x". 



OGC 14-039 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 17 
 

 
For this rule we define the filter based on RunwayElementTimeSlice/ 
availability/ManoeuvringAreaAvailability/operationalStatus. The rule will apply when 
the value of this property is CLOSED.  
 
The rule can be applied on top of a base airport layout, but care must be taken that this 
rule is executed at a later point than the rules for the base runway. Rules inside the same 
SE file are executed from top to bottom. In other words: this rule needs to be defined 
below the base rule for runway elements. 
 

We chose an orange color for the X's, to comply with the SAE-G10 guideline examples, 
and because it contrasts well with the base runway colors. The style overlays X's over the 
entire runway, as was required by the SAE-G10 document. 
 
On top of that, we also visualize the outline of the runway as thick blue line. This was 
also inspired by the SAE-G10 guideline examples. (See Figure 1) The blue outlines have 
the additional advantage of increased noticeability, even when the runway is visualized at 
a small scale.

6.1.5 Problems encountered & proposed solutions 

6.1.5.1 Usage of WellKnownName 

One issue with the style proposed above is that it is client dependent. The 
"WellKnownName" symbol is not fixed in the Symbology Encoding specification. 
Because of this, the visualization thereof could be different depending on the client 
implementation, causing inconsistent styling across platforms. 
 
The proposed solution to avoid the potential issue of unknown “WellKnownName” could 
be to refer to an ExternalGraphic in the rule instead: 

<Graphic> 
<ExternalGraphic> 

<OnlineResource xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="x.png" /> 
                 <Format>image/png</Format> 

</ExternalGraphic> 
<Size>16</Size> 

</Graphic> 
 



OGC 14-039

The externally referenced file “x.png” should be a 16x16 png containing a red cross covering the 
entire image. To ensure that the crosses don’t blend into a single mesh of lines, there should be 
some spacing between the crosses. This can be encoded in the file itself, as can be seen in Figure 
3. 
 

 
Figure 3 - Example of a 16x16 cross with some spacing 

 
 

 
6.1.5.2 Using a fixed pixel GraphicFill 

 

Two problems arise from using a GraphicFill with  a fixed pixel size. It means that 
printing at high-DPI will result in a different style when compared to a low-DPI monitor. 
Note that a typical modern day monitor uses display resolutions of around 100 DPI, while 
printing uses resolutions of 300+ DPI. 
 
An SE Symbolizer supports three types of units of measure: pixels, feet and meters. A 
proposition would be to add a unit of measure that takes into account the pixel density of 
the device. This would help create more consistent styles across different devices. This 
could become more important in the future as more high-DPI screens are becoming 
available on the market. 
 
A second issue with having a pixel sized Fill Graphic is that at certain scales, the Runway 
Element will be thinner than the Graphic (in pixel coordinates), making the cross pattern 
unrecognizable. 
 
This issue has been already partially been tackled by the fact that we visualize the outline 
of a closed runway with a distinct blue color (See figures 1 and 2). 
 
6.2 Displaced threshold runway 

6.2.1 Recommendation 

A displaced threshold runway gNOTAM should indicate the portion of the runway that is 
closed for touch down and be drawn to scale to provide an indication of the landing 
distance available.  This will help ensure that users will be able to see the portion of the 
runway that is closed for touch down regardless of the scale of the display, and that they 
will not be misled regarding the portion available for landing.[…]  



OGC 14-039 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 21 
 

6.2.2 Rationale 

Cues are important to provide users with a way to quickly evaluate the gNOTAM’s 
implications.  Users need to know which portion of the runway is available and which is 
unavailable for touch down. A displaced threshold gNOTAM should indicate the portion 
of the runway that is not available for touchdown and should be drawn to scale to 
provide an indication of the portion of the runway that is unavailable.  This will help 
ensure that users will be able to see the portion of the runway that is unavailable 
regardless of the scale of the display, and that they will not be misled regarding the 
portion available. 

6.2.3 Portrayal proposal 

One way to depict this is to use a white bar and white arrow heads to indicate the location 
of the line between the usable and unusable portion, and white arrows to indicate the 
centerline of the approach direction (see Figure 4). While the gNOTAM may not be able 
to depict the numerical LDA, if the user needs to know the exact value of the LDA they 
can return to the text-based NOTAM.  While reading the text-based version of the 
NOTAM to identify the exact values is always required, providing cues (drawing to 
scale) to users in the gNOTAM will help prevent them from being misled. 

 

Figure 4 - SAE-G10 proposal for Displaced Threshold Runway gNOTAMs display 

 

6.2.4 Symbology Encoding 

We turn to the AIXM 5.1 data model to help us visualizing the displaced threshold 
NOTAM. The AIXM 5.1 data model contains an element that was meant exactly for this 
scenario: The RunwayMarking.  
 
A RunwayMarking can be seen in the following example:

To fully visualize the intended runway markings, it is required that the DNOTAM 
contains all relevant RunwayMarking elements, as well as their geometry. Including the 
geometry in the DNOTAM is crucial to correctly visualizing the NOTAM at a correct 
scale. The geometry can be any GML 3.2-based shape.  
 
It is also important that each of these RunwayMarking elements are correctly linked to a 
Runway found in the base airport layout. This can be done by filling in the 
“markedRunway” property with an xlink. This helps the client correctly identify which 
RunwayMarkings belong to which Runways.  
 
On top of that, it is also required for the DNOTAM to contain every single 
RunwayMarking that it wishes to make invisible. Generally, a Displaced Threshold 
Runway DNOTAM will want to override some or all existing RunwayMarkings on a 
Runway. To do this correctly, each existing RunwayMarking that needs to be overridden 
should be part of the DNOTAM, but with an explicitly empty geometry component. This 
ensures that the RunwayMarking is invisible for the duration of the TEMPDELTA 
timeslice update in the client. 
 
An example of how to make a currently visible RunwayMarking temporarily invisible 
(i.e. to have it replaced by another RunwayMarking) is given below. Notice the empty 
element property, that overrides any possible geometry associated with the 
RunwayMarking:

Please note that the identifier of this example has to link to a readily available 
RunwayMarking in the base dataset. Otherwise, the TEMPDELTA timeslice update will 
not work correctly. For the example above, it is assumed that a RunwayMarking with 
identifier “5d1153-a3adcad153-13ca35c35ad” exists in the base dataset. The client uses 
this information to create SNAPSHOT timeslices for correct visualization of a given time 
instance. 
 
For the rest of this chapter, it is assumed that incoming DNOTAM notifications contain 
both the set of the new RunwayMarkings (containing the full geometry of each 
RunwayMarking) and a set of RunwayMarkings that should become invisible (With 
correct identifiers to currently active RunwayMarkings and explicitly empty geometry 
components). 
 
Once these conditions are met, the SE rules for visualizing RunwayMarking elements is 
relatively simple. According to SAE-G10 recommendations, they should be filled with a 
white color. This can be handled with a PolygonSymbolizer. No filter is needed as 
RunwayMarkings should always be visualized to aid any navigating pilots. An example 
of this is shown in the example below:

The depiction of the runway markings using SLD/SE in the Luciad Aviation client is 
shown in Figure 5. The RunwayMarking elements are visualized on top of the base 
RunwayElements. This is achieved in the client by making sure that RunwayMarkings 
are painted in a separate layer that is always on top of RunwayElements. 

Note that the RunwayMarking feature in the AIXM 5.1 data model does contain a 
“colour” property per markingElement. It was chosen for this testbed to disregard this for 
the SE file defined above. While this “colour” property can easily be part of SE-based 
visualization, we chose to follow the SAE-G10 guidelines to always visualize 
RunwayMarkings as a white fill color.

6.2.5 Problem encountered 

While not strictly a problem, it should be noted that for this testbed we didn’t have a clear 
example of a DNOTAM event to test our portrayal on. For this reason the assumptions 
we make in the previous section are also recommendations for how to transmit 
RunwayMarking information using DNOTAM messages. 

6.2.6 Proposed solution 

As mentioned in section 6.2.46.3.4, the following information should be transmitted in 
the DNOTAM message for correct portrayal in a client: 

 Each new RunwayMarking that needs to be visualized needs to be included in the 
DNOTAM message as a TEMPDELTA timeslice, with information on their total 
timeframe, as well as the geometry. If new RunwayMarkings are defined, their 
identifiers should be globally unique and new. 

 Each RunwayMarking that needs to be overridden, as a result of the DNOTAM 
message, should also be included in the DNOTAM message. These 
RunwayMarkings need to have a correct identifier that refers to existing 
RunwayMarking features in the base airport layout. They should explicitly be

given with an empty set of geometry components. (Example can be found in 
section 6.2.4). 

6.3 Runway shortened 

6.3.1 Recommendation 

A shortened runway gNOTAM should indicate the portion of the runway that is closed 
and should be drawn to scale to provide an indication of which portion is available and 
which is closed. This will help users comprehend the portion of the runway that is closed 
regardless of the scale of the display. 

6.3.2 Rationale 

Cues are important to provide users with a way to quickly evaluate the gNOTAM’s 
implications. If users can recognize that a portion of a runway that is closed based upon 
the graphical depiction, then they are less likely to miss the closed portion of runway 
even if they are viewing the runway on a scale that only shows part of the runway.

Figure 6 - SAE-G10 proposals for Partially Closed Runway gNOTAMs display 

 

6.3.4 Symbology Encoding 

In DNOTAMs, the case of partially closed runway is expressed in a manner different 
from what is inferred by the SAE-G10 recommendation. The textual NOTAM associated 
with such a restriction is expressed as follows (example of a partially closed in Chicago): 

!IAD 03/001 IAD RWY 1C/19C S 400FT CLSD 1403180047-1403211200 



OGC 14-039 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 29 
 

The interpretation of such a NOTAM is that 400 feet to the south of the runway 1C/19C 
is closed, between the 18/03/2014 at 00:47 and the 21/03/2014 at 12:00. 

The SAE-G10 recommends that the unusable part of the runway be emphasized. 
 
It is important to note that as far as the AIXM 5.1 domain model is concerned, there is no 
distinction between a partially closed RunwayElement, and a fully closed 
RunwayElement. In both cases the only piece of available information is the 
operationalStatus of the ManoeuvringAreaAvailability property. This is either closed or 
not. 
 
For this reason, it is currently not possible to have a separate visualization for Runway 
Shortened DNOTAM and Runway Closure DNOTAM. We subsequently chose to re-use 
the same Symbology Encoding Rule for Runway Shortened. We refer the reader to 
section 6.1.4 for an explanation on how to visualize closed runways according to SAE-
G10 guidelines. 
 
One other problem we faced is that in the Runway Shortened DNOTAMs examples we 
received, it was not entirely possible to visualize the DNOTAM right out-of-the-box 
using the DNOTAM 2.0 guidelines and AIXM 5.1 temporality model. The problem is 
that in order for a part of a runway to be closed, a DNOTAM message has to be produced 
that contains the exact portion of the runway that should be closed. This could either be 
done by splitting up the runway into smaller fixed-length segments in advance, or by 
superimposing a new RunwayElement over the base runway. More information on this is 
given in the next sections.  
An example of a runway shortened NOTAM visualized in the Luciad Aviation Client is 
shown in Figure 7.

6.3.5 Problem encountered 

As mentioned in the previous section, there is currently no way to differentiate between a 
closed runway and a partially closed runway, as both are based on the 
ManoeuvringAreaAvailability set to CLOSED. Since both visualizations are similar 
however, we believe that is possible to use the same visualization for both DNOTAMs. 

A second issue we encountered is lack of an exact definition of what a Runway 
Shortened DNOTAM should contain in terms of updates to AIXM 5.1 RunwayElement. 
We briefly touched on this subject in the previous section, and offer 2 possible solutions 
in the next section. 

6.3.6 Proposed solution 

Depending on the required granularity of Runway Shortened DNOTAMs, it is feasible 
that the difference between Runway Shortened and Runway Closure DNOTAM is 
dropped. If a runway (in the base data) is split into small sections of RunwayElements 
(for instance one every 100 feet), then each RunwayElement can become CLOSED 
individually. The only remaining requirement for this case is to include a correct 



OGC 14-039 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 31 
 

reference to the identifier for each RunwayElement section of the base runway that needs 
to be closed. This way, there is no distinction between Runway Shortened and Runway 
Closure as far as functionality and portrayal is concerned. The advantage here is that 
there is reduced complexity, as existing functionality is re-used. 

If on the other hand granularity of Runway Shortened NOTAMS is very fine-grained 
(e.g. with 1 foot accuracy), then a second option might to supply the geometry of a new 
RunwayElement as a superposition over the current RunwayElement. It is crucial for this 
case that the full geometry of this new RunwayElement is supplied in the DNOTAM 
message. This geometry should represent the closed part of the Runway. The client will 
draw the closed part of the RunwayElement over the existing RunwayElement. 

Besides being more accurate, the second option also has the added benefit of being more 
flexible with runway base-data that is not split up into smaller RunwayElement sections. 
It requires less work to process base-data that already exists. 

For this testbed we chose to use the second alternative, as we didn’t have readily 
available base data where the runway elements were split up in fixed lengths. 

6.4 Taxiway closure 

6.4.1 Recommendation 

The gNOTAM of a closed taxiway should indicate that the entire taxiway is closed, 
ensuring that users will be able to see that the taxiway is closed regardless of the scale of 
the display.  One way to accomplish this is to superimpose X’s over the entire length of 
the closed taxiway rather than just at the end of the taxiway. 

6.4.2 Rationale 

If users can recognize that an entire taxiway is closed based upon the graphical 
depiction, then they are less likely to miss the closed taxiway even if they are viewing the 
taxiway on a scale that only shows a portion of the taxiway.

6.4.3 Portrayal proposal 

 

Figure 8 - SAE-G10 proposal for Closed Taxiway gNOTAMs display 

 

6.4.4 Symbology Encoding 

Taxiway Closed NOTAM is similar to Runway Closed NOTAM, and as such, any 
remarks mentioned in section 6.1 are also valid here.  
 
To adhere to the examples given in the SAE-G10 guidelines document (See Figure 8), we 
chose to visualize taxiway closure DNOTAMs with an orange background fill pattern, 
with black crosses on top of them. 
 
The orange background visualization has the added benefit that it can easily be 
distinguished from runways, as well as taxiways that are not closed.

As mentioned in the Runway Closure section, it is possible to use an ExternalGraphic

SE rule because the orange background can be part of the image used to define the cross 
(See figure 9). An example of this can be found in section 6.1on Runway Closure 
NOTAM. See Figure 10 for representation of a Taxiway closure in the Luciad client.

6.4.5 Problem encountered & proposed solutions 

The strategy used here being the same as for the Runway Closed DNOTAMs, please 
refer to the section 6.1.5 for encountered problems and proposed solutions.  

6.5 Temporary Flight Restriction 

6.5.1 Recommendation 

The NOTAM display should clearly define the subject in TFR gNOTAMs by providing 
both the horizontal boundaries (latitude and longitude) and the vertical boundaries 
(lower and upper altitudes) when they are superimposed over baseline products (e.g., 
sectional chart, moving map). 

6.5.2 Rationale 

If users are provided with TFR gNOTAMs that display both vertical and horizontal 
boundaries, in the correct geographical position, users will be able to more effectively 
avoid the TFR.

6.5.4 Symbology Encoding 

Looking closely at the examples given by the SAE-G10 guideline document, we notice 
that we can split the visualization up into two components.  

The first component is the easiest: A thick red outline. For this we use LineSymbolizer 
with pixel width 3. The thick nature of the line makes it very noticeable at any scale. 

The second component is a bit more complex. We can represent the hatching pattern as a 
very wide dashed line. For this we use a LineSymbolizer with a Stroke that represents a 
dashed red stroke. The width of the stroke is the length of the inclined lines. We can use 
the perpendicularOffset property to make sure the line inclinations are on the inside of the 
airspace, by using a negative perpendicularOffset equal to half the width of the stroke. 

It is important for a client to correctly interpret the perpendicularOffset property. A 
positive value will should make a stroke appear on the outside of the polygon, while a 
negative value should make a stroke appear on the inside of the polygon.  

The distinction is important because we need to be easily able to identify which part of 
the airspace is inside. It is common for airspaces to touch each other at their boundaries, 
so without correct functioning of the perpendicularOffset property, it would be 
impossible to tell what is the inside and what is the outside of an airspace at certain 
scales. 

The Symbology Encoding rule for this is shown below:

6.5.6 Proposed solution 

N/A 

6.6 Changes to an Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) 

6.6.1 Recommendation 

The flight deck display system should provide a filter function as part of the NOTAM 
capabilities that allows users to filter out NOTAMs not associated with the selected IAP 
(e.g., changes associated with minima, changes to missed approach procedures and new 
requirements (e.g., DME, radar)). 

6.6.2 Rationale 

Section 6 identifies basic filtering functionality as a desirable subject.  However, IAPs are 
often associated with a large subset of elements such as frequencies, runways, approach 
procedures, approach lighting systems, etc.  Providing this additional filtering function 
will allow users to further refine the NOTAMs that are shown, thus reducing the burden 
of managing irrelevant information.   

6.6.3 Portrayal proposal

6.6.4 Symbology Encoding 

At the time where this report is being written, there is no such thing as a DNOTAM for 
change to an Instrument Approach Procedure. Creation of rules to abide the SAE-G10 
recommendation has to be left for future work.

7 Conclusion 

The investigation documented in the ER allowed demonstrating that a majority of the 
guidelines enounced in the ARP 6467 can be complied with using the Symbology 
Encoding Standard. 

For the recommendations that could not be complied with, the nature of the problem took 
different forms: Either there were no practical examples of the NOTAM category tackled 
by the ARP (that is the case of the change of IAP NOTAM), or the NOTAM lacked 
sufficient amount of information to create a SE rule to abide the recommendation (for 
instance in the Runway Shortened case). In the first case, further work needs to be done 
for the definition of the digital version of the considered NOTAM. In the second case, 
several options could be considered. In this report we provide guidelines and 
recommendations on the correct structuring of DNOTAM events to ensure that they 
properly work with the AIXM 5.1 temporality model. 

On the portraying part, attention needs to be taken in the client implementation to ensure 
readability of the information conveyed by the DNOTAM. This is the case for the 
depiction of X’s on a closed runway or taxiway: varying resolution of the display 
hardware or of the application may result in loss of understandability of the information. 
This could be tackled in the future by improving the SE standard, providing the 
possibility to have rules depending on the pixel density of the display for instance. 
Attention also needs to be paid on the usage of SE rules properties, such as the 
perpendicularOffset. A misusage may result in loss of readability. 

Overall, the Symbology Encoding standard is deemed exhaustive enough to address the 
recommendations and requirements of the SAE-G10 ARP6467. Additions may need to be 
made to the AIXM and DNOTAM standards, to ensure that the features required for SE 
rule generation are mandatory in the content of the DNOTAM. 

Finally, it should be noted that the results we achieved in an example client required no 
special extensions or custom functions to work. All results were achieved by following 
the proposed guidelines for DNOTAM events, the AIXM 5.1 temporality model and 
Symbology Encoding 1.1.
