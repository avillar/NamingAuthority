1. Scope 

This Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 2 Engineering Report (AIP-2 ER) describes the practice of deploying, 
documenting, and registering contributed resources from the point of view of classes of GEOSS users who rely on 
GEOSS to support discovery and access to those resources. It emphasizes two paradigms for the GEOSS Common 
Infrastructure: 1) Service-oriented infrastructure for development of service-based community applications by 
technically advanced users; and 2) Content-oriented search facility and Web-based access mechanisms for end-users 
with a range of technical skills and domain knowledge. "End-to-end" here refers to the bidirectional connection 
between desired discovery practices and goals on the user end; and the required resource interfaces and 
documentation on the provider end. 

 

2. Introduction  

This ER is a key result of the second phase of AIP.  AIP-2 was conducted from July 2008 to June 2009.  A separate 
AIP-2 ER describes the overall process and results of AIP-2 and thereby provides a context for this E2EDA ER.1  
Another ER describes the general use cases which this report seeks to weave together. Yet another set of ER’s 
covers the ways in which discovery and access have been implemented in specific SBA (Societal Benefit Area) 
community scenarios in the course of AIP-2. 

 

2.1 Definition of End to End Discovery and Access 

The term ‘end-to-end discovery and access’ (E2EDA) is coined to describe the relationships discerned during the 
course of AIP-2 between practices for publishing and providing earth observations, and the paradigms employed by 
GEOSS users for finding and getting to those observations. It comprises a variety of GEOSS practices: 

• Providers choose to deploy resources (data, services, applications) based on earth observations. 

• Providers then document and register those resources so they can be found and accessed. 

• Consumers (users) pursue an objective and choose questions related to societal benefits and/or earth 
observations 

• Consumers seek both relevant resources and the tools to work with them, such as client software. 

These practices have to be connected if they are to be successful. Providers wish to deploy resources so that they can 
be put to good use. Consumers wish to find available resources to meet their needs. Certain threads dominate this 
end-to-end connection: 

• Users can only find resources that are described by the metadata and indexed by the properties that matter 
to them and with which they are familiar. In the realm of earth observations, this typically includes at least 
the specific increments of space and time which have been observed, and the specific phenomena which 
have been measured in the course of the observation. Other properties and classifications may also be 
important  

• Earth observation information can only be utilized effectively when it is offered through services for which 
clients are readily available for access, comparative evaluation, and exploitation. Typically, metadata are 
necessary but not sufficient to make final decisions about suitability–some direct experience of information 
resources is also required. 

E2EDA emphasizes above all the need for clear communication of requirements across GEOSS between all 
stakeholders, so that each link in the discovery – access chain is both functional and essential.

2.2 Initial conditions: CFP, SOW’s, Kickoff meeting, Working groups 

Initial plans for discovery and access were established in the AIP-2 Call for Participation, particularly in the GEOSS 
Architecture (CFP Annex B), and the scope of activity was further refined based on statements of work from the 
participant. An AIP-2 kickoff meeting held in September 2008 established an important distinction between working 
groups focusing on particular knowledge communities, and ‘transverse’ working groups focusing on general aspects 
of the development and use of GEOSS. 

 

Transverse technology working groups: 

• Catalogues, Clearinghouse, Registries and Metadata (CCRM) WG: Doug Nebert, USGS; Josh Lieberman 
OGC/Traverse; Ted Haberman, NOAA 

• Workflow and Processing WG: Greg Yetman, CIESIN; Eugene Yu, GMU; Satoshi Sekiguchi, AIST;  

• Test Facility for service registration WG: Gianni Sotis, Mauro Semerano, ESA 

• Portals and application clients WG: Nadine Alameh, OGC/Mobilaps; Herve' Caumont, OGC/ERDAS 

 

Particularly in the CCRM working group, the connection between registration processing, metadata publication, and 
the ability of users to find and access the right resources has been developed. 

2.3 E2EDA and GEOSS Common Infrastructure 

GEOSS as a ‘system of systems’ is composed to a considerable extent of the constituent systems established or 
being established at both governmental and community levels. Nonetheless, there is intended to be a core system 
organized around the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI) serving to connect the resources of the constituent 
systems. As a form of system ‘glue’, the GCI has been the primary focus for work on E2EDA

Figure 1 – AIP-2 Engineering Components Augment the GCI IOC  

Figure 1 illustrates the various types of engineering viewpoint components considered to make up GEOSS as a 
whole. GCI is composed of a particular subset of these components, namely the GEOSS Registries, GEOSS 
Clearinghouses and GEO Web Portals. There has been discussion from the beginning of AIP-2 as to whether Web 
Portals should be considered part of the GCI, but work on user needs in AIP-2 has made clear that the availability of 
a consistent user interface and experience, at least for discovery and minimal access, is an essential common element 
of GEOSS. 

While GCI may be the common ground for enabling E2EDA, it is the registered community resources that are the 
ultimate source of the resource metadata to be discovered and the interfaces to be accessed. 

 

2.4 GCI Resources and Roles 

The basis for the functional paradigm of the GCI consists of the distinct roles played by its three main systems: 

• GEOSS Registry – GEOSS Providers register their Components and Services in the Component and 
Service Registry according to Interoperability Arrangements registered in the Standards Registry. 
Providers either register their resources directly or register metadata services that in turn describe their 
resources. 

• GEOSS Clearinghouse – A Clearinghouse is a catalog server providing uniform query interfaces to all of 
the diverse resource metadata and metadata services registered directly or indirectly with the GEOSS 
Registry. The Clearinghouse harvests the registration records from the Registry and then either harvests the 
registered metadata services in turn, or relays queries from Clearinghouse Clients to those services. 

• GEO Web Portal – One type of Clearinghouse Client is a GEO Web Portal. It provides a catalog user

End to End Discovery and Access Engineering Report   Date:  23 September 2009

interface for building Clearinghouse queries and also provides a Web Map Service client for those GEOSS 
resources provided through such a service. A GEO Web Portal may provide additional organization of 
GEOSS resources, for example into Societal Benefit Areas. 

The types of resources that can be registered in GEOSS are discussed further along in this report. 

 

2.5 GCI and the outside world  

GEOSS exists in an environment where information sharing has become common practice. In various parts of the 
world, spatial data infrastructures (SDI) are being developed or are evolving (INSPIRE, US NSDI, GSDI, etc.). As a 
result of these developments many organizations have started to host services and components that may be of use for 
the GEOSS user community. In many cases the organizations participating in those efforts already participate in 
GEOSS. 

“Here Be Dragons” 

The development of these resources external to the GCI results in a wealth of existing content potentially being 
available to the GEOSS user community. It also means, however, that if the GCI wants to leverage these external 
developments it will have to deal with a heterogeneous offering of components and services and their descriptions in 
metadata; it will also have to deal with diverse prior user experiences when it comes to the way that discovery and 
access work in the GCI.  

 

3. User Requirements  

While AIP-1 focused more on the initial capabilities of the GCI and on the initial provision of resources to GEOSS, 
AIP-2 was able to examine in more depth how users and communities might make best use of GEOSS. This has led 
to an examination of both the types of users (defined for example in the GEOSS Concept of Operations2) and their 
typical activities (expressed in use cases) as guides to further requirements for GCI functionality. 

3.1 User types 

A set of user types is listed in Table 1.

3.2 Discovery and Access Use Cases 

The connection between user types and discovery activities is described by discovery use cases. The AIP-2 Use 
Cases Engineering Report3  describes a fundamental set of GEOSS use cases in detail. The report contains 
generalized use cases intended to be applicable across a spectrum of GEOSS users and applications. Specialized use 
cases derived from the general ones are then defined in separate AIP-2 SBA Scenario ER’s. In this report, the 
relationship of the discovery and access use cases to E2EDA is particularly considered. 

Figure 2 illustrates some of the relationships among the generalized use cases. Those three to the left involve a user 
or consumer of GEOSS resources, while the four to the right involve a publisher or provider of those resources. The 
three use cases in the middle primarily involve machines and software, for example client applications and Web 
services, as actors. While E2EDA focuses on the user experiences and provider responsibilities, successful 
implementation of all of the use cases, including machine-centric ones, is necessary to achieve the desired end-to-
end flow of information.

Figure 2 – Use Cases for the AIP Service-Oriented Architecture 

Figure 2 presents the principal “transverse” use cases. The use cases are keyed by color to the type of activity they 
describe. Lines indicate the main actors in each use case. For example, Use Case 5 involves both a GEOSS user and 
a client application. Use Case 6 involves the interaction of that client application with one or more deployed service 
resources (latter connection is not shown for clarity). Use Case 02 in turn involves the publishing of the service 
resource by a GEOSS service provider. 

3.2.1 Discovery use cases 

Discovery use cases primarily involve interactions with metadata such as creating it, deploying it to metadata 
services, registering it with the GEOSS Registry, querying and presenting it. Successful discovery requires metadata 
to be a reliable description of the resources being sought. Discovery workflow typically also involves approval that 
the published metadata is complete and correct.  The availability and functionality of described services also need to 
be verified through some sort of testing.  

Table 2 describes which principal discovery use cases shown in Figure 2 might involve particular types of (human) 
users.

3.2.2 Access use cases 

Access use cases involve both the availability (ability to be accessed) and usability (ability to be interacted with) of 
resources through interoperability arrangements that can be implemented by providers and utilized by consumers. 
For example, a user of a Web service for data access typically needs to find both the service endpoint where 
resources of interest are available and a suitable client for that type of service that interacts successfully with that 
particular service and provides functionality to the user. 

Table 3 lists the principal access use cases shown in Figure 2 that would typically involve particular types of users.

3.3 Roles of E2EDA in community scenarios 

Figure 2 shows that end-to-end discovery and also access depend on threads of use cases being implemented and 
actuated in concert. The transverse use cases also stand as general / conceptual activities to be specialized and 
instantiated for community scenarios. Support for E2EDA should then be visible as connected steps that derive from 
the use case threads. As Table 4 shows, this visibility is spotty within the documented community scenarios. There 
appear to be two reasons for this. To be fair, articulation of the E2EDA thread concept developed at a late stage of 
AIP-2. The second reason is a continued focus in the community scenarios on solving community problems with 
collected and known resources, rather than on increasing the visibility of the resources themselves within GEOSS.

4. Metadata 

4.1 Roles for metadata in discovery and access 

Discovery and access of resources is supported by metadata. The GEOSS components and services are described by 
various metadata standards and profiles, typically driven by the context in which they were created or organization 
that created them. 

 

4.2 Implications of user expectations for provider documentation 

There is a difference between describing something so that it can be discovered and describing something so that it 
can be fully understood. When looking at current trends on the Web where people share videos, photos, and such, 
there is a trend to provide very brief information: a title, description, and a reference to the resource. This 
information is often sufficient for general discovery purposes. To fully understand the resource in order to assess its 
usefulness or applicability to GEOSS actors like the Experienced User or the Issue-oriented User, additional 
information is necessary.  

Based on these general Web experiences, Issue-oriented Users expect from GEO Portals to find relevant resources 
based on a simple search interface that is similar to what they encounter on the Web. This search interface may 
support keyword as well as spatial searches. The users will also expect fast responses. The combination allows them 
to iterate through searches, modify searches by adding more specific words, limiting results to a specific area and 
such. 

 

4.3 Metadata standards and crosswalks 

With the advent of ISO 19115/19119/19139 there is a framework for describing these resources more fully for the 
purpose of understanding. However, these international standards allow for variations through the creation of 
profiles. The large SDI initiatives (North America and INSPIRE particularly) already have created profiles of the 
ISO standard that are different in various aspects. At the core (metadata to support discovery) there is generally 
sufficient overlap but considerable work in AIP-2 was needed to even define this overlap and document resulting 
gaps4 . 

 

4.4 GeossRecord as a common denominator 

A “common” common denominator between the various metadata standards in use may be defined as the following 
items for search: 

- Unique identifier 

- Title 

- Abstract 

- Spatial extent of the resource 

- Reference to resource 

- Type of resource 

- Last date of modification of the resource 

This corresponds reasonably well to the csw:Record structure as defined by OGC in the CSW specification, which 
consists largely of the more common Dublin Core elements. There have been a number of indications in both AIP-1

End to End Discovery and Access Engineering Report   Date:  23 September 2009 
 

Page 15 

and AIP-2, however, that certain additional or more precise metadata elements play a critical role in discovery of 
earth observation resources. In csw:Record, for example, an ows:BoundingBox is included for greater specificity 
and ease of processing than what might be provided for by dct:Spatial. Three The following additional / more 
specific parameters have been proposed: 

o Observed footprint – particularly in the case of satellite observations, a bounding box may be too 
coarse to be sufficiently discriminating, and there are many cases where the location an observation 
was made is not in fact identical to the footprint of that part of the earth to which the observation 
applies (“feature of interest”). 

o Observed time period – this is another case where any number of temporal markers may be described 
in metadata (publication, update, processing, etc.), but for earth observations the critical element is the 
time instant or duration that the observation event actually discerned. 

o Phenomenon – while this may roughly correspond to dc:subject, a precise indication of what the 
observation served to estimate (not necessarily the same as what was measured) is the critical property 
for most earth observation applications. This may or may not include the other indicator of what was 
examined, medium. 

o Medium – the type of earth material that exhibits the observed phenomenon (e.g. water versus air 
temperature). This often is the critical property that distinguishes observation data of interest to a 
particular community. 

o Model – this term is used broadly to describe either the process / sensor used to derive an observation 
from measurements, or the simulation model used to predict or interpret an observation from older or 
indirect measurements. This is another parameter that is critical for both discovery and selection of EO 
resources, and is only vaguely accounted for in more general metadata elements (e.g. dc:source) 

The combination of csw:Record elements and the above additional EO parameters has been suggested as a 
mandatory “geoss:Record” for contributed GEOSS resource descriptions. 

This discussion describes the common catalog service queryables, however, with respect to the returned metadata, it 
is recommended that catalog services ensure inclusion in the response fields of URL’s both to the full metadata, and 
to the data/service endpoint. Existing csw:Record fields could hold this information, but clarification of the format 
and content mapping should be considered both in GEOSS and in CSW. Another recommendation from practice is 
to encourage use of more robust, standard metadata content – with a recommendation of ISO 19115/19139 and 
specific service profiles. This would greatly assist in defining minimum interoperability at an actionable level for 
discovery. 

4.5 Data-><-Service and other resource associations 

Some of the specifications in use allow for associations between metadata. These associations typically signify 
associations between resources (a service exposes a dataset, service metadata references dataset metadata, a client 
application binds to a service). For many discovery and access scenarios, they form essential queryable parameters, 
but are not yet well supported or managed in either the generally used metadata records or in the present registry and 
catalog implementations.

5.2 Standards and Interoperability Registry 
The Standards and Interoperability Registry (SIR) supports the registration and discovery of the standards and 
special arrangements that can be used by GEOSS in support of interoperability.  Standards are formally recognized 
specifications that are published and maintained by a standards development organization, while special 
arrangements are specifications not formally adopted as a standard, but widely used within one or more communities 
as if it were a standard.  Although a standard or special arrangement proposed for inclusion in the SIR is typically 
associated with services registered in the Components and Services Registry, it need not be.   
 
Registration of a standard or special arrangement can occur two ways.  It can be registered in the first way by 
navigating to the SIR site and choosing to propose an entry.  This function requires that the person wishing to submit 
the standard or special arrangement be a registered user at the SIR.  Once user registration is complete, and the 
submitter has logged in at the SIR, then the act of registering the standard or special arrangement may take place.  
The form displayed for the submitter collects information about the proposed entry, as well as contact information.

The fields and their descriptions, other than contact information, are described in Table 6. 
 

Table 6 – SIR Registration Fields 

Field Name Required Description 
Entry Type Yes Identifies the proposed entry as a standard or special arrangement. 

Name No A compact designation to denote the proposed standard or special 
arrangement. 

Version Yes The formal version number of the proposed standard or special arrangement. 

Title Yes The formal title by which the proposed standard or special arrangement 
should be known.  It should include the version and/or the publication date. 

Description Yes A description of the proposed standard or special arrangement, stating its 
nature, properties, scope, and other qualities. 

Author No The name of the body or organization that originally created the proposed 
standard or special arrangement.  This is a pick list of standard development 
organizations.  If OTHER is chosen, then the submitter can enter the author. 

Publisher Yes The name of the body or organization responsible for the publication and 
maintenance of the proposed standard or special arrangement.  This is a pick 
list of standard development organizations.  If OTHER is chosen, then the 
submitter can enter the publisher. 

Primary 
Taxonomy 
Category 

Yes A category from the Earth Observations Standards Taxonomy.  This is a pick 
list showing the current taxonomy supported by the SIR.  If a new category is 
needed, choose the closest category now, and explain in the Comments field 
the reason for the new category, remembering to supply the new category's 
proposed name and parent. 

Secondary 
Taxonomy 
Category 

No A category from the Earth Observations Standards Taxonomy.  This is a pick 
list showing the current taxonomy supported by the SIR.  A secondary 
category is one that also fits the standard or special arrangement, but not as 
strongly as the primary taxonomy category chosen. 

URL No The URL that points to where the specifications for, or additional information 
about, the proposed standard or special arrangement may be obtained. 

URN No A globally unique, persistent identifier used for recognition or access to the 
proposed standard or special arrangement, and typically assigned by the 
standards development organization responsible for the standard or special 
arrangement. 

Superseded 
URN 

No A globally unique, persistent identifier used for recognition or access to the 
standard or special arrangement being superseded.  This must be chosen from 
the already registered standards and special arrangements. 

Comments No Any additional information to help in the evaluation of the proposed standard 
or special arrangement, such as special circumstances, disciplines served, 
references to implementations or test harnesses of the interoperability 
arrangement, etc. 

 
The submitter can either submit the proposed standard or special arrangement, or save a draft of it so it can be 
completed at a later time.  At any time while completing the form, if the submitter encounters a usability or 
functionality problem, a form can be filled in to report the details of the problem to the SIR administration team.  
This form can be accessed by clicking on the feedback link in the page.

The second way in which a standard or special arrangement can be proposed for inclusion in the SIR is when a 
service is being registered at the Components and Services Registry.  See Section 5.3 for details.  The fields to be 
supplied are the same, but there is no opportunity to save a draft.  Once a standard or special arrangement is 
submitted from the Components and Services Registry, it is automatically associated with the service being 
registered. 
 
The SIR supports discovery of registered standards and special arrangements through a search capability.  Searches 
can be basic or advanced.  Advanced searches allow searches based upon specific field values, as well as 
combinations of field values.  Searching the SIR does not require logging in, but drafts will not be found through a 
public search. 
 
 

5.3 Components and Services Registry 
The Components and Services Registry (CSR) supports the registration and discovery of the components and 
services that are associated with the data sharing goals of GEOSS.  The registered components are viewed as 
GEOSS resources that fall broadly into the categories of an offered system, program, or initiative.  Some of the 
specific choices include observing systems, catalogs, portals, datasets, and information feeds.  The registered 
services describe the means to access separate functional aspects of a registered component.  Services can only be 
registered in association with a component; therefore, components must be registered prior to their associated 
services.  Additionally, each service interface can be associated with one or more GEOSS-registered standards to 
promote interoperability and accessibility by end users and their software. 
 
In order to register components and services at the CSR, the contributor must be a registered user at the CSR, and be 
logged in at the CSR.  The registration order is components, followed by associated services, and for each service a 
set of associated standards or special arrangements.  These do not all need to be accomplished simultaneously.  A 
CSR user can register a component, and then return to the CSR at a later time to register associated services.  
Similarly, the set of associated standards and special arrangements for a service can be registered at a later time than 
the service.  As stated in Section 5.2, the registration of standards and special arrangements can take place at the 
CSR or the SIR. 
 
To register a component or service at the CSR, one navigates to the CSR and chooses the link to contribute a 
resource to GEOSS.  Then, a page is displayed with the choice of registering a component or a service.  A service 
can be registered for an existing component only if the user who created the component is logged in to register the 
service.  Before registering a service, the existing component that the service is to be associated with will need to be 
provided; then a link will be made available to access the service registration form.  There is a separate registration 
form for components and services, as well as the standards or special arrangements associated with the services.  
However, the form for standards and special arrangements has exactly the same fields as the SIR form.  Except for 
contact information, the fields for component registration are described in Table 7 and the fields for service 
registration are described in Table 8.

and the end date can be ongoing. 

Standards / Special Arrangements 
Reference Information 

No Two lists composed of taxonomy categories from the SIR, 
with registered standards and special arrangements under 
their respective categories.  Choosing an existing standard or 
special arrangement immediately associates it with the 
service being registered.  Choosing a category allows the 
completion of the standard or special arrangement entry 
form, and associates the proposed standard or special 
arrangement with the service being registered. 

 
The submitter can either submit the proposed component or service, or save a draft of it so it can be completed at a 
later time.  At any time while completing the form, if the submitter encounters a usability or functionality problem, a 
form can be filled in to report the details of the problem to the CSR administration team.  This form can be accessed 
by clicking the feedback link on the page. 
 
The CSR supports discovery of registered components and services through a user interface and a programmatic 
interface.  The user interface allows basic and advanced searches.  Advanced searches allow searches based upon 
specific field values, as well as combinations of field values.  Programmatic searches are facilitated via an exposed 
OGC CSW interface.  Searching the CSR does not require logging in, but neither drafts nor pending submissions 
will be found through a public search. 
 

5.4 Best Practices Wiki 

Registration of recommended “best” practices is supported by means of the Best Practices Wiki. This was not 
particularly exercised during AIP-2 but there was rough consensus that focusing interoperability arrangements by 
means of recorded practice will be necessary for an effective GCI.

6. Clearinghouse 

6.1 Overview 

Clearinghouses provide federated and uniform access to distributed metadata and also include some facilities to 
manage the content of the clearinghouse: 

- Publish metadata 

- Validate metadata 

- Remove metadata 

- Approve metadata 

- Manage harvesting process – ingest, update, map, integrate 

- Manage cascading query generation 

 

6.2 Clearinghouse capabilities and examples 

During AIP-2, three GEOSS Clearinghouses were in operation: 

• ESRI 

• Compusult 

• FGDC 

6.2.1 ESRI GEOSS Clearinghouse 
The ESRI Clearinghouse and ESRI GEO Web Portal are built using the ESRI ArcGIS Server Geoportal Extension, a 
complete solution for discovery and access to geospatial resources, supporting: 

• Searching with text and spatial ranking and thesaurus support. 
• Discovery and publishing of content through OGC CSW 2.0.2 (KVP + SOAP) and REST interfaces as well 

as OpenSearch support. 
• Clearinghouse management functionality. 
• Various workflows for publishing and validating clearinghouse content, including online forms, registering 

services of any kind, and harvesting remote clearinghouses. 
• Extensible support for metadata schemas and profiles. 

6.2.2 Compusult Clearinghouse 
The Compusult Clearinghouse and GEO Web Portal are based on WES Catalog, a component included with 
Compusult’s Web Enterprise Suite series of products, supporting 

• Automatic harvest and periodic re-harvest of OGC Web Services and other standards-based metadata 
• Automatic registration and export of metadata in multiple formats (FGDC, ISO, DDMS, Dublin Core) 
• Supports access to metadata content from Z39.50 catalog servers 
• Deployment as an OGC  CSW 2.0.2 Web Service 
• Query capabilities including spatial regions, keywords, temporal, service types, etc.. 
• Distributed search of remote registered CSW catalogs. 
• Automatic generation of RSS feeds for latest information published 

6.2.3 FGDC Clearinghouse 
The FGDC Simple Clearinghouse is a prototype GEOSS Clearinghouse instance consisting of: 

• A small database schema of fields common to most metadata records An instantiation of the database 
schema (currently in MySQL) 

• A mapping between the database fields and metadata elements in various metadata formats (e.g., FGDC, 
ISO10119) 

• A series of perl scripts to harvest and ingest metadata records 



GEO Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 2   Version:           1.0 
End to End Discovery and Access Engineering Report   Date:  23 September 2009 
 

Page 22 

• A CGI perl script to serve as a demonstration web-based interface for searching and displaying records 
• A web-based administrative interface 

The Clearinghouse queries the GEOSS Service Registry for relevant services (catalogs primarily but not 
exclusively) and stores the service entry points from those services to use for later harvesting. 
 

6.3 Clearinghouse-><-Registry interactions 

The GEOSS Clearinghouses connect to the GEOSS Components and Services Registry (CSR) to discover registered 
components and services. Some of the components are themselves metadata catalogs. The Clearinghouses index the 
components/services and may harvest the referenced metadata catalogs. The interaction between the GEO 
Clearinghouses and the CSR is automated through a periodic harvesting mechanism. 

The CSR implements an ebRIM type information model, exposed through an OGC CSW interface. The GEOSS 
Clearinghouses may themselves implement different information models, some based on OGCCORE, others based 
on the ISO Application profile of CSW. This may result in differences in handling the information retrieved from 
the GEOSS Registry. As long as this does not negatively affect the findability of the components and services 
registered in the GEOSS Registry, this diversity may not be a significant problem. 

  

6.3.1 Registration and Clearinghouse policy 
In order to make harvesting metadata records from community catalogs into Clearinghouses both useful to Portals 
and relatively non-invasive to the remote site, a number of harvest-related parameters and constraints should be 
made explicit.  These constraints should generally be stated by the catalog sites to be harvested, since their content 
and bandwidth will be affected the most by the harvesting process.  The natural place for these constraints to be 
specified is in the Service Records held in the Component and Service Registry (CSR).  Doing so would make the 
constraints an intrinsic part of the service discovery mechanism for Clearinghouses and also would make 
specification of harvesting constraints part of the registration process.  Following is a preliminary list of 
considerations for developing a harvesting strategy that the Clearinghouses could utilize: 
 

• Harvest or Distributed Search? 
 

o Should the Clearinghouse harvest records from the catalog site (thereby allowing the 
Clearinghouse to search the records locally), or should queries to the Clearinghouse be relayed to 
the catalog site? 

 
• If Harvest: 

 
o How often can the remote catalog site be harvested or updated? 
o Can all records be harvested at one time?  Over a period of time?  Not at all? 
o If not all, how many records can be harvested at one time and how many total records can be 

harvested? 
o If not all, what is a query (or queries) which would return a representative subset of records to be 

made searchable by the Clearinghouse? 
o Is there some sort of record aggregation that can be used to group records which are similar in 

content (perhaps, differing only in spatial and temporal footprint)? 
 
 

• If Distributed Search: 
 

o Does the remote catalog publish a searchable interface (Web Accessible Folders cannot be search 
by themselves)? 

o Do the remote catalogs support a common set of queryables and returnables to allow for consistent 
presentation of search results? 



GEO Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 2   Version:           1.0 
End to End Discovery and Access Engineering Report   Date:  23 September 2009 
 

Page 23 

o Are the ranking algorithms used in the remote catalogs compatible? This will affect the ability or 
usefulness of merging results from more than one remote catalog. 

o Is the remote catalog available and what is its performance? The clearinghouse operator is not in 
control of these two factors when implementing distributed search. 

 
Note that if harvesting is not permitted, one can sometimes but not generally infer what searches and protocol are 
permitted from the Service record itself or, where appropriate, from a Capabilities document pointed to by the 
Service record. 

6.4 Harvesting / cascading practice 

As mentioned above, the GEO Clearinghouses may harvest metadata holdings from catalogs/clearinghouses that 
have been registered with the GEOSS Registry. This cascaded harvesting may have some unanticipated side effects, 
such as indexing an exponentially growing number of resources or indexing resources multiple times that have been 
registered in more than one catalog/clearinghouse. 

The number of resources will affect system performance, but may be addressed by proper sizing of the hardware 
environment used to host the GEO Clearinghouse. It has to be noted that performance of the GCI is determined not 
just by the performance of the GEO Clearinghouse, but largely depends on performance of the components and 
services registered. It is suggested that service level agreements be put in place supported by the proper resources to 
sustain the desired level of performance and availability. 

The issue if resources recur in multiple catalogs may be addressed by ensuring that every metadata document for the 
resource has a global unique identifier that is part of the metadata document and is persistent when contained in 
multiple catalogs. The metadata standards that are in use provide some mechanisms to assign such a globally unique 
identifier, but in common practice these are treated as optional and not forcibly unique. It is suggested that GEOSS 
engage in discussions with the various standardization bodies to address this issue fundamentally. 

 

6.5 User queries 

User queries to the GEO Clearinghouses typically occur through a front-end application as provided by the GEO 
Portals. Integrators and application developers may choose to interact with the GEO Clearinghouses directly through 
their client applications. In this case, the application uses the service interface provided by the GEO Clearinghouses. 

All of the GEO Clearinghouses that are part of the AIP support the OGC CSW 2.0.2 interface, providing a common 
denominator in the interaction through use of the OGCCORE mandatory queryable parameters of CSW. The result 
is that although individual GEO Clearinghouses may implement different information models (ebRIM, ISO, 
OGCCORE), integrators need not be concerned when accessing the GEO Clearinghouses through the OGCCORE 
implementation of the CSW 2.0.2 service. 

In addition to the CSW interface, some of the GEOSS Clearinghouses (for example the ESRI GEO Clearinghouse) 
implement support for OpenSearch (http://www.opensearch.org) with a URL-based RESTful interface. This 
interface supports performing searches of the Clearinghouse from within lightweight Web clients. 

 

7. Geoportals and geo-applications 

7.1 Portal functions 

GEO Web Portal functions include: 

- Discovery and access of resources 

- Interaction with the services (e.g. WMS preview in support of determining if service/component is useful 
for the purposes of the Experienced User or Issue-oriented user) 

- Access to community catalogs/portals 



GEO Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 2   Version:           1.0 
End to End Discovery and Access Engineering Report   Date:  23 September 2009 
 

Page 24 

- Access to general GCI information 

- Organization of GEOSS Resources, e.g. along the lines of Societal Benefit Areas. 

Typically a GEO Portal will include some functions that require security in the form of authentication 
(personalization, contribution of content, administration…). It is suggested that GEOSS investigate the use of 
common authentication mechanisms or standards (such as OpenID). 

 

7.2 Portal – clearinghouse interactions 

GEO Portals may interact with one or more GEO Clearinghouses. The user uses the GEO Portal to formulate 
queries. The GEO Portal then submits the query to one or more GEO Clearinghouses. Responses from the GEO 
Clearinghouses are presented to the user in the GEO Portal.  

There are several models to consider: 

- Work with 1 clearinghouse that contains harvested content (geodata.gov) 

- Work with many clearinghouses but direct searches to one clearinghouse at a time (ESRI GEO Portal) 

- Work with many clearinghouses and federate searches to more than one clearinghouse at a time (not yet 
exercised) 

- All of the above 

 

7.3 Portal information management 

Portals may include a Content Management System (CMS) as a tool to maintain the portal content. This would not 
maintain content that is obtained from a Clearinghouse, only information, metadata, or documents being made 
available exclusively through the GEO Web Portal. GEO Web Portals may integrate with these CMS to provide a 
seamless user experience. Single sign-on support is a key element of this seamless user experience, although this 
sort of management of unique Portal content, particularly across Portals, is not yet an explicit part of the GCI. 

 

7.4 GEO Web Portals, Community portals, and domain applications 

Given Web service interfaces for both the GEOSS CSR and the Clearinghouses, it is of course possible and even 
desirable for a variety of client applications to be to discover resources within them. This does introduce a variety of 
challenges, however, to accomplishment of a uniform and successful user discovery and access experience. There 
are at least three issues here that have been encountered in AIP-2: 

1. Different client applications will typically implement different user interfaces for the same service, such as 
a Clearinghouse. The queries they generate may also not be consistent from application to application, 
leading to differences in what resources a particular user will find. To be fair, this is also encountered to 
some extent when utilizing different Clearinghouses. 

2. Organizing or categorizing metadata which is unique to a GEO Web or Community Portal will not be 
available for use in other client applications even when those applications are used against the same 
Clearinghouse. 

3. A domain-specific application will presumably provide a more efficient and capable interface for users 
from a particular community, but there may be no easy way for that application to then generate 
Clearinghouse queries that focus on resources of interest to that community. An example from AIP-2 was 
the AQ community looking for resources related to “air” without any assurance that all possibly relevant 
resources were actually tagged or described in this way.

8. Interoperability testing of discovery functions 

8.1 Interchange tests 
When Web services and clients may come from different vendors, operate on different platforms, and exchange 
different content resources, validation of interoperability among these software packages is critical. Validation is 
typically carried out through interchange experiments in which, for example, a catalog service is accessed by several 
different catalog clients, and conversely several different catalog services are accessed by a particular client. Such 
interchanges were initiated during AIP-2 but have not yet been rigorously completed 5 . 

8.2 Conformance tests 
When interoperability between system components is enhanced by use of standard arrangements, testing of 
conformance with those standards is a critical validation step. The Test Facility Working Group examined many of 
the issues involved in such testing6 .  

8.3 Status tests 

The first step in successful access to a provided Web service, of course, is for that service to be available and 
responsive. Tests were made with a service status checker provided by USGS7 against registered GEOSS services to 
examine the feasibility of this type of testing. 

 

9. Resource provider experiences and practices in AIP-2 
This report section discusses some of the participant experiences and developed / piloted practices in AIP-2 as they 
relate to the theme of end-to-end discovery and access. 
 

9.1 Registration process 
The GEOSS registration process was a subject of much discussion and experimentation since it serves something of 
a dual role. One role is to point the Clearinghouses to metadata for query / harvest. In this role, any sort of path to 
the metadata that a Clearinghouse can follow will do. Another role, though, is to let a provider declare a contribution 
to GEOSS. To this end, particular information is useful not only of what is being published but exactly how it is 
being provided for use in GEOSS. 

9.1.1 Direct versus indirect registration 
Just as component and service registration can serve two purposes, registration can also be performed in two ways. 
Using direct registration, a provider registers each service resource (for example, a WMS) directly and then provides 
a link to somewhere that a service description is provided. Indirect registration involves registering a metadata 
service (e.g. a catalog) describing provided resources instead of the components and services themselves. This in 
turn provides metadata about service resources such that their contribution to GEOSS is implied. 
Reasonable assumptions can be made that each contribution should show up only once in a Clearinghouse search, 
and that metadata attributes concerning either the component (e.g. dataset) and service interface (e.g. WMS) might 
be important for discovery. In this case, there are drawbacks to each registration approach. In the direct method, 
only one component can be registered “per” service, so registration of more than one dataset exposed through a 
WMS can result in the WMS appearing multiple times. In the indirect approach, the holdings of a registered 
metadata service such as a community catalog may not really be intended for GEOSS and generally lack metadata 
elements included in direct registrations.

9.1.2 Component – service and other relationships 
In general, the present limitation in the CSR on resource associations (only one-component-to-one-or-more-services) 
results in some confusion and difficulty in describing provider contributions. This is particularly the case with the 
different types of components that can be registered. While some additional relationships can be expressed within 
provided metadata (one example is to provide valid metadata document links for each layer in a WMS), this is not 
often done in metadata and even more rarely utilized for discovery.  In a more general sense, relationships and the 
links that represent them are the cornerstones of Web search, so being able to register or otherwise make them 
available for discovery would have additional benefits. 

9.1.3 Metadata construction and registration 
A number of AIP-2 participants, particularly those developing Community Catalogs for the first time (e.g. as Web-
accessible Folder types of metadata service provision) worked on development of metadata documents for their 
services and other resource contributions. A particular challenge for them, with guidance from Habermann and 
others, was to balance selection of the metadata elements for a variety of purposes, from Clearinghouse harvest and 
user discovery methods to dataset evaluation and selection of most appropriate service clients. One advantage of 
registering metadata created specifically for GEOSS, at least, is that metadata usage particular to GEOSS discovery 
and access scenarios can be accounted for in the process. This was noted particularly in regards to Web services, 
where OGC-style capabilities documents and WSDL documents generally do not have all of the metadata elements 
important to user discovery needs. 
 

9.1.4 Clearinghouse preference expression 
Since exposure of registered resources through a GEOSS Clearinghouse is somewhat unique to GEOSS, there are 
preferences and guidance to be expressed as to how this should be done and maintained. Such information is not 
normally included in metadata descriptions and is not yet part of the attributes of the registration process. Examples 
include the frequency with which metadata changes and should be re-harvested, whether a metadata service should 
be harvested versus accessed via distributed query, and whether a service registered for one component is in fact the 
same service instance as one registered for another component. 
 

9.2 Findability 
Issues of “findability” relate both to whether a user query shows up the resources it intends to (e.g. all air quality-
related resources), whether only the resources that in fact match the query show up in the results (i.e. do all the 
needles show up without the haystack) and whether enough information is presented to be able to access relevant 
resources. 
 

9.2.1 Queryable parameters 
The most important factor in structured discovery is whether the right queryable parameters are available and have 
been registered for the resources of interest. An example discussed earlier concerns whether a set of observations 
has been described accurately by the phenomena that were observed. A second concern for queryable parameters is 
whether the domain of valid values for each queryable parameter is available (e.g. in the form of hints) to guide the 
user in forming successful searches. In the End-to-end sense, this guidance also needs to be arranged effectively for 
the user of a search client application such as a GEO Portal and optimally filter information resources to correspond 
to a user’s available means of access (e.g. client applications). Where possible, parameter domains should be also 
conform to interoperability arrangements such as standard taxonomies in order to further simplify and facilitate 
successful query strategies. 

9.2.2 General versus GEOSS-specific publication.  
As discussed above, many instances were uncovered in AIP-2 where GEOSS-specific metadata and methods of 
publication contribute significantly to successful E2EDA. For example, given GEO Portal capabilities to support 
WMS access to discovered resources, links to such an interface in the metadata, and provision of WMS interfaces to 
resources at a the desired granularity (e.g. sensor or group of sensors) have particular value. Creating and 
maintaining metadata separately for GEOSS and non-GEOSS publication, however, can be a sizeable burden for

some participants. 

9.2.3 Global identifiers 
Under the category of minimizing haystacks, ambiguities in the GEOSS registration process as well as multiple 
community catalog registrations, challenges in asserting resource relationships, and version or lineage issues can 
lead to too many query responses, unless an agreed global identifier scheme allows true uniqueness of resources to 
be determined. One particular manifestation of this concerned provider interest in registering both a resource and a 
metadata service holding for that resource without double entries showing up in Clearinghouse queries. 

9.2.4 Drill-down capabilities 
A common requirement expressed by a number of participants involved users being able to discover high-level 
resource collections (e.g. entire sensor nets)  or entities (e.g. organization involved in meteorology) of interest, and 
then drill-down to sub-collections and even individual data elements through iterative discovery and access. This 
constitutes as well another sense of E2EDA, describing levels of exploration running from high-level discovery to 
fine-grained access and evaluation. Successful implementation of this capability requires not only the right metadata 
and links at multiple collection summary levels but also widespread publication of services to facilitate the fine-
grained access end of the drill-down spectrum, such as a WMS implementing time and/or sample dimension access 
to single observation layers. 

9.3 Sustainability 
One of the goals of GCI is to support discovery and access to earth observation resources in as “live” a manner as is 
feasible. Several issues worked during the Pilot pertained to maintaining the currency of data published through 
GEOSS as well facilitating up-to-date discovery of the holdings exposed by other services. 

9.3.1 Harvesting and query distribution options 
One question as to resource currency is how often a particular component or service resource is updated and how 
extensive a metadata resource might be. There was interest in expressing for benefit of the Clearinghouses how 
often the metadata for a resource should be re-harvested and/or whether instead queries to the Clearinghouses should 
be distributed dynamically to metadata services such as Community Catalogs. There have been arguments in favor 
of different locations for denoting these preferences. Alternatives include the metadata records themselves, the CSR 
registry records, or with directly with each Clearinghouse. It makes sense from the point of view of clarity and 
responsibility to do this in the CSR, but does introduce additional overhead to keep the preferences themselves up to 
date.  

9.3.2 Resource update and versioning / lineage 
In the case of both dynamic and derivative earth observation information discovered and accessed through GEOSS, 
there is a need for rather more metadata than might ordinarily be the case, so that in the end a user can query or 
determine the currency and validity of available data. For example, time descriptions may need to indicate: 

1. When an observation was made 
2. When or what version of information (model result, processed feature of interest) was derived from the 

observation. 
3. When the description of the above information was last updated. 
4. When a metadata service resource, e.g. Clearinghouse holding, was last updated to check whether 3) had 

been updated. 
5. And so on… 

In the larger theme of versioning and lineage, while there are general metadata elements such as in ISO 19114 to 
describe these properties, but it was clear during AIP-2 that best practices for usage of these elements should be 
agreed and followed. Issues of version notification were raised in the course of the pilot, e.g. changes to processed 
observation results triggered by subsequent inter-calibration adjustments, but this was not explored in any detail. 

9.3.3 Testing 
As discussed earlier in this report, several types of testing were recognized as relevant to users being able to rely on 
service resources published to GEOSS. In the case of testing interoperability, there is clearly a tradeoff between 
welcoming diverse resource contributions and being able to exercise and document a useful range of interchanges 
between data sources, service instances, client applications, and types of users. This is another area within which 



GEO Architecture Implementation Pilot, Phase 2   Version:           1.0

Page 28 

narrower best practices were recognized as critical to effective E2EDA, but not a lot of progress could be made in 
this direction during AIP-2. 

9.3.4 Community metadata and social networking 
It is clear that formal metadata and registration is only a part of what most users rely on for finding and getting the 
most out of information resources. Word of mouth and expert recommendations can be even more important. This 
was recognized, even for expert users themselves and certainly for facilitating cross-community and “unexpected” 
resource discovery. Facilities for this inside or outside of GCI were not, however, stood up or exercised to any 
significant extent during AIP-2. 
 

9.4 Meeting user needs 
During the last phases of AIP-2 in the context of hashing out the E2EDA concepts, new ad hoc and anecdotal 
information on user needs provoked extensive discussion. 

9.4.1 Structured query 
Service-oriented architecture and traditional record-oriented catalog practices tend toward queries in which values 
for a set of metadata parameters needs to be specified by the user in order to filter and find resources. This process 
sounds good in concept, but becomes increasingly problematic for many users as the number and diversity of 
resources increases and even expert / technical users become accustomed to Web search methods. Three issues at 
least have been raised in this vein: 

• Diverse resources are typically described by diverse parameters, so some but not all potentially relevant 
resources can be found using a particular query strategy.  

• “Hints” or “Facets” as to valid parameter values and available holdings for a parameter value important for 
successful discovery and winnowing down of results, but not widely supported in structured query facilities 

• Full-text search is important for “unexpected” discoveries, but needs to be supported by effective ranking 
methods, which methods are usually supported by analysis of links between resources and informal 
metadata about them (e.g. tags, recommendations, prior usage) 

An interesting case in point was developed by the AQ-Health working group. They attempted to find their own and 
other registered resources by looking for anything relevant to “air”. It was unclear which search field could be used 
uniformly for this purpose, even keywords, and text search did not generally support both effective expansion (e.g. 
atmosphere as well as air) and filtering in order to “find the needles”. 

9.4.2 Application development / integration 
Much of the activity in the SBA working groups centered around development of scenario “applications” 
comprising relevant data or data options, services, clients to access those services, and workflow to bring these 
elements together into a beneficial outcome. This arena is where structured query is generally most beneficial as the 
application developers know what they are looking for, how it is typed and described, and what clients can be used 
or developed to exploit the utilized services. The role of discovery, however, in the AIP-2 scenario applications 
remained limited, although more extensive than in AIP-1. To some extent, this is a reflection of the expected 
abundance of resources. As such applications are reused and discoverable GEOSS resources grow, the usefulness of 
discovery should grow as well. It is not yet clear given this lack of exercise whether the scenario application work to 
date has developed a practice that will be able to find and integrate new resources effectively in the future. 

9.4.3 Unexpected finds 
An important objective of E2EDA through the GCI is the “unexpected” discovery and utilization of data in domains 
and applications for which it was not created or intended. Of course it is difficult to plan for the unexpected but 
“fortune favors the prepared”. Most reports of unexpected use describe this arising from personal and informal 
communications. It would be valuable to look at what information these communications are based on and what 
patterns of discovery may be involved, so any relevant preparation can be made. This might even be as simple as a 
WMS “map of the day” offered up by GEO portals which is related in some way to the text of recent queries, or it 
might involve ad hoc tagging. Indexing of GCI holdings by Google Custom Search was explored by Nebert during 
AIP-2 and might provide another approach to this sort of preparation for serendipity.

9.5 Other issues and discussion 

9.5.1 Is registration relevant to Web search? 
As GEO looks at Web search paradigms to enhance discovery, it is worth considering whether a registration / 
clearinghouse / query process really can provide much of the hypermedia richness which is required for Web search 
to be effective. Much of what lies behind the REST principles of information architecture has to do not with formal 
publication of metadata but with exposing as much as possible of the relational riches that are contained within 
content resources by way of Web protocols, namely HTTP. This issue was discussed during AIP-2 but not explored 
in detail and should form part of subsequent work. 

9.5.2 Determining and communicating “best standards” 
There has clearly been a progression in the development of GCI from a “bring whatever you have” approach to 
recognizing that a limited set of best standard interoperability arrangements are the way to improve the effectiveness 
of all aspects of GEOSS discovery, access, and exploitation. In particular, this is the shortest route to developing 
trust that if scenario applications support specific arrangements, then future resources such as new services will 
likely be compatible as well. 

9.5.3 Framework data and standard data types 
It is no accident that by far the most common form of data integration, particularly in what are termed “mashups” 
involves combining diverse datasets on a map. While it is clear that the geospatial aspect of earth observation data is 
critical to address for GEOSS, a reliable basis for global geospatial / geodetic interoperability has so far not been 
developed. There seemed to be a good consensus at the end of AIP-2 that remedying this gap with framework data 
and standard concrete data types (e.g. not just GML, but “Level-2 political boundaries”) would be a worthwhile and 
important next step. 

9.5.4 Role and feasibility of mediation between GEOSS communities 

Several SBA scenarios, particularly the biodiversity ones, utilize explicit mediation components to help users 
discovery and access data and services which they may not have the vocabulary or protocol capabilities to work with 
on their (or their client’s) own. To a less formal extent, both the Clearinghouses and the GEO Portals are intended to 
provide some mediation by organizing resources according to more familiar categories. What was not achieved was 
explicit representation of the mappings and inferences in order for mediation itself to become an interoperable 
resource. This is another area for further productive work. 

 

10. Recommendations 

Some other recommendations for future work on E2EDA and GCI are listed below. 

1. GEOSS should anticipate heterogeneous metadata but promote minimum documentation for specific 
purposes, e.g. GEOSSRecord for discovery. 

2. GEOSS should aim to use existing standards/specifications and work through the proper channels where 
modifications to these standards/specifications are deemed appropriate. 

3. GEOSS should perform an analysis of the expected system load on the GCI in terms of numbers of users, 
numbers of resources. GEOSS should define (realistic) performance requirements based on the usability 
testing experiences. 

4. It is suggested that service level agreements be put in place supported by the proper resources to sustain the 
desired level of performance and availability. 

5. It is suggested that GEOSS engage in discussions with the appropriate standardization bodies to address the 
issue of including a globally unique metadata identifier as a mandatory item in the metadata specifications. 

6. It is suggested that GEOSS investigate the use of common authentication mechanisms or standards (such as 
OpenID)
