i. Preface 

This document specifies a rule for constructing OGC names that may be used for 
identifying ontology resources.  

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the normative terms (SHALL, SHOULD, etc) defined in Subclause 
5.3 of [OGC 06-121r3], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2: Rules for the 
structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not 
“must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to comply 
with this specification. 

Name production rules in this document are expressed using ABNF (IETF RFC 5324).

Name type specification – ontology resources 
1 Scope 

An OGC name is required for ontology resources published by OGC. This includes OWL 
ontologies, classes and properties.  

NOTE: This set of names is intended to be used for ‘T-box’ ontology elements. 
‘A-box’ ontology elements, and supporting elements such as functions and rules, 
are identified with /def/ identifiers, as described in 
http://www.opengis.net/doc/def-names-1  

 

2 Normative references 

IETF RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax (2005) 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 

IETF RFC 5234 Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF (2008) 
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234

3 Terms and Definitions 

3.1 T-box 

T-Box statements describe a conceptualization, a set of concepts and properties for these 
concepts.  

NOTE: T-Box statements are broadly equivalent to a ‘schema’ or data model, classes and 
their properties.   

3.2 A-box 

A-Box statements are T-Box-compliant statements.  

NOTE: A-Box statements are broadly equivalent to ‘data’, instances and individuals.

4 Naming rule 

4.1 OGC name schemes 

A http URI scheme [IETF RFC 3986] is defined by OGC to provide persistent names for 
resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. The generic syntax for 
OGC names is described in [OGC Naming Authority – Procedures].  

The generic syntax for OGC http URIs is  

   URI = "http://www.opengis.net/" OGCResource "/" ResourceSpecificPath 

The following ABNF adapted from [IETF RFC 3986] provides some basic definitions 
required in the rest of this document.   

   segment       = *pchar 

   segment-nz-nc = 1*pchar-nc 

   pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@" 

   pchar-nc      = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / "@" 

   pct-encoded   = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG 

   unreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" 

   reserved      = gen-delims / sub-delims 

   gen-delims    = ":" / "/" / "?" / "#" / "[" / "]" / "@" 

   sub-delims    = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" 

                 / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" 

4.2 Production rule for ontology names 

The basic form for an OGC name that identifies an ontology resource shall be produced 
using the following rule: 

   OGCResource          = "ont" 

   ResourceSpecificPath = [ aggregate “/” ] ontology [ "#" code ] 

   aggregate  = segment-nz-nc ; token denoting a set of 
ontologies 

   ontology             = segment-nz-nc ; token denoting the ontology  

   code                 = segment-nz-nc ; localname for ontology element 

The base URI (i.e. without the ‘#’ separator and ‘code’ element) is used to identify an 
ontology as a whole, which may import other ontologies.  



  OGC 12-081 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 3 

A full URI denotes an ontology class or property.  

 

5 Name assignment policy 

The register of names http://www.opengis.net/register/ogc-na/name is controlled by 
OGC-NA. Changes to this register (addition, deletion, and supersession) shall be initiated 
by a submission to the OGC Naming Authority names@opengeospatial.org.  

 

6 Examples 

The following ontology resources are defined in OGC’s GeoSPARQL standard 
http://www.opengis.net/doc/geosparql :  

- http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql 

the GeoSPARQL ontology.  

- http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#SpatialObject 

the SpatialObject class from the GeoSPARQL ontology.  

- http://www.opengis.net/ont/gml#Polygon 

the Polygon class from the GML ontology.  

- http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#hasGeometry 

the hasGeometry property from the GeoSPARQL ontology.
