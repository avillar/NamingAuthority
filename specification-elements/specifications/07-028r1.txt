Introduction 

This document contains a description of the schema tailoring process for application 
schema development based on the U.S. National System for Geospatial-Intelligence 
(NSG)  GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile (GSIP) as developed in conjuction 
with the Open Geospatial Consortium Interoperability Program initiative OWS-4. In 
particular it discusses: 

- Creation of ISO 19109 (Geographic information - Rules for application schema) 
conformant Application Schemas in UML from the GSIP 

- Derivation of the GML Application Schemas using the ShapeChange UML-to-GML-
Application-Schema conversion tool 

- Metadata describing GSIP-based application schemas to support their discovery and 
assessment using CS-W 2.0 services based on the ebXML Registry Information 
Model

GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile Schema Processing 

1 Scope 

This OpenGIS® document describes and discusses the process of creating application 
schemas in support of the NSG from NGA data based on the GEOINT Structure 
Implementation Profile (GSIP) which has been based on the NSG Feature Catalog.  

The approach used to create the application schemas starts with the creation of ISO 
19109 conformant application schemas in UML. These UML models are then used as 
input to the Shape Change UML to GML conversion tool deriving GML application 
schemas from the UML models in an automated process.  

This document also discusses schema metadata and it’s use in an OGC compliant 
Catalogue Service for the purpose of discovery and retrieval.

Figure 1 — UML notation 

In the class diagrams, the following stereotypes of UML classes are used: 

a) <<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent 
existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no 
operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information. 

b) <<BasicType>> A special type of a DataType that typically has a canonical 
representation in a computing platform, in this case XML Schema. 

c) <<CodeList>> is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of 
potential values. 

d) <<Enumeration>> is a fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values. Attributes 
of an enumerated type can only take values from this list.  

e) <<Union>> is a list of attributes. The semantics is that only one of the attributes can 
be present at any time. 

In this document, the following standard basic data types are used: 

a) CharacterString – A sequence of characters 

b) Integer – An integer number 

c) Real – A floating point number

d) Boolean – A boolean value (true or false) 

e) Measure – A numeric value associated with a unit of measurement

6.2 Feature data dictionaries  

The DGIWG Feature Data Dictionary (DFDD) contains geographic information concepts 
used by member states of the DGIWG community to characterize aspects of features, i.e.

OGC 07-028r1 

real world phenomena. It is the successor of the Feature and Attribute Coding Catalogue 
(FACC), a component of the Digital Geographic Information Exchange Standard 
(DIGEST).  

The NSG FDD is the DFDD-based feature data dictionary as specified by NGA/NCGIS. 
It is a subset of the DFDD without items that are not relevant for NGA, but a number of 
extensions have been added to represent information used by NGA and its customers; the 
extensions are often drawn from other data dictionaries. 

The proposed ISO 19126 (Geographic information – Feature concept dictionaries) is the 
underlying abstract specification of the feature data dictionaries. 

6.3 Feature Catalogs and the GSIP 

The NSG Feature Catalog draws from the concepts (feature types, attributes types, 
enumerants, etc.) defined in the NSG FDD and binds them together in a feature catalog 
according to ISO 19110 (Geographic information – Methodology for feature 
cataloguing). 

Objectively, the NSG Feature Catalog will authoratively specify the GEOINT data 
elements. Feature catalogs that document the data elements used in a specific community 
or application, e.g. the Local MSD Feature Catalog, is a subset of the NSG Feature 
Catalog. 

In order to define application schemas that are an ISO 19109 conformant specification of 
the feature types and their properties in a formal conceptual schema language, more 
information is needed than typically contained in a feature catalog. Therefore, the term  
"GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile" (GSIP) is used to denote the extended 
version of the NSG Feature Catalog that contains this additional information. 

6.4 Application schemas and implementation specifications 

The intent is that GSIP contains all required information so that schema representations 
for the whole NSG Feature Catalog or any profile like Local MSD can be derived 
through fully automated processes from the GSIP. 

Target schema representations in OWS-4 are 

- ISO 19109 application schemas in UML to represent the conceptual model 

- GML 3.2.1 application schemas to make NSG data available through services like the 
Web Feature Service 

Additional implementation representations, e.g. for ESRI Shape file, SQL database 
management systems, Java classes, etc. could in principle be derived as well.

6.5 Scope within OWS-4 

This subclause describes the work done within OWS-4 in the context of the NSG Feature 
Catalog stack: 

• All application schemas were created based on product profiles of the GSIP, derived 
automatically from the GSIP. These schemas include the full GSIP schema, the Local 
MSD and the DAFIF Ed. 9 schema. The content of Vertical Obstructions and Stereo 
Airfield Collection schemas is available and the associated GML application schemas 
can be derived automatically by the process described in this document. As said 
above, the product profiles are all strict subsets of the GSIP, which is based on the 
NSG FC as the common feature catalog for NGA data (and the GKB).  

• Based on the scripts developed in OWS-3, NGA has created scripts that create a 
Rational Rose UML model from the GSIP or one of the derived product profiles. 

• The mapping rules from the GSIP metamodel to the UML application schema taking 
ISO 19109, ISO/TS 19103 and the ISO 19136 (Geographic information – Geography 
Markup Language, GML) based GML application schema derivation into account. 
This has been done in several iterations. 

• The GSIP identifies a whole series of feature level metadata. 

• The ShapeChange UGAS tool has been updated as required to address all information 
encoded in the UML model. The target GML version is GML 3.2.1.  

• A GML profile for GSIP has be created and documented.  

• Schema metadata to be published in the OWS-4 catalogs for an application schema 
has been specified. The target is discovery metadata based on DDMS 1.3. Schema 
metadata includes information about application schemas, feature types, property 
types and views (see 7.4).

Step (1) is executed using an application creating a Rational Rose UML model from the 
GSIP maintained by NGA. The application is implemented in Visual Basic. 

Step (2) is executed using the Open Source UGAS tool “ShapeChange” developed by 
interactive instruments (ii). More information about the tool including documentation can 
be found at http://www.interactive-instruments.de/ugas/. The tool documentation includes

one document describing the mapping rules from UML to GML as implemented by the 
tool plus a second document describing the implementation of the ShapeChange tool, its 
installation and guidelines for using the tool.

7 ISO 19109 Application Schema in UML 

7.1 Package structure 

The following UML packages were created by the script: 

- A root package for the GSIP or the product profile (stereotype <<Application 
Schema>>) in addition to the ISO 19100 harmonized model. The package is marked 
as dependant on the Harmonized Model of the ISO 19100 series. 

8 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

 

- Tagged values are added to the application schema package to associate the 
application schema with  

 an XML namespace for the GML application schema (see GML Annex E) 

 an XML namespace prefix for the GML application schema document (see 
GML Annex E) 

 an XML Schema document representing the root document of the GML 
application schema (see GML Annex E) 

 a version number (see GML Annex E) 

 a modification date 

 date and time of the schema generation 

 a unique identifier 

 a creator (see ISO 19115 and DDMS) 

 a publisher (see ISO 19115 and DDMS) 

 a list of topic categories (see ISO 19115 MD_TopicCategory) and a 
namespace for the coded values 

 a list of views (see 7.4) and a namespace for the coded values 

 a list of other subject categories and a namespace for the coded values 

 IC security classifications (see Intelligence Community Information Security 
Marking) 

 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  9
 



OGC 07-028r1 

 

- Within the root package, sub-packages are created for categories defined in the NSG 
Feature Catalog (e.g. “Aerodrome”, “Agricultural”, etc.). 

10 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

 

- Within each category package another package for each sub-category  (e.g. within 
“Aerodromes”: “Aeronautical Buildings and Structures”, etc.). As packages without 
sub-packages these were tagged with the stereotype <<Leaf>>. 

 

- The tagged values “targetNamespace”, “xmlns”, “xsdDocument” and “version” are 
set for the package with stereotype <<Application Schema>>. The tagged value 
“xsdDocument” may also be set for sub-packages. 

7.2 Feature types and associated data types 

The following feature type classes were created by the script: 

- An abstract feature type “FeatureEntity” which adds a number of predefined 
properties. All other feature types are suptypes of this type. 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  11
 



OGC 07-028r1 

- All feature types have a stereotype <<FeatureType>>. 

- One class per feature type in the NSG Feature Catalog using the alpha codes as names 
of the class, attributes and association roles.  

 

- This code has also added in a tagged value “primaryCode”. The DFDD code has 
added in a tagged value “secondaryCode” which may be used for mappings to 
implementation platforms that limit the length of name fields (eg shape files). 

- The human readable name is added in the tagged value “Title”. 

- The feature type is associated with the ISO 19115 (Geographic information – 
Metadata) topic categories listed in the tagged value “TopicCategory”. Tagged value 
“TopicCategoryNamespace” has a unique namespace for these keywords, in this case 
fixed to “http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd/MD_TopicCategoryCode”. 

- The feature type is also associated with the views listed in the tagged value “Views”. 
“ViewsNamespace” again has a unique namespace for these keywords, in this case 
fixed to “http://www.nga.mil/gsip/classification/Views”. 

12 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

- The feature type is associated with other keywords listed in the tagged value 
“SubjectOther”. “SubjectOtherNamespace” again has a unique namespace for these 
keywords which may vary from application schema to application schema. In the 
example the keyword “GSIP” was added. 

- The tagged value “oclExpressions” allows capture of additional constraints related to 
the feature type using OCL. These constraints are typically also shown in the class 
diagram showing the feature type. In case of the taxiway, the invariant constraint 
“self.geometry->forAll(g | (g.isKindOf(CurveGeometryInfo) or 
g.isKindOf(SurfaceGeometryInfo))” specifies that geometries are either curves or 
surfaces (but not points). 

- The tagged value “schPatterns” is a placeholder for a translation of the 
“oclExpressions” to Schematron for the implementation of the feature type in a GML 
application schema.  used in the OWS-4 application schemas. 

- The tagged values “noPropertyType” (always true), “byValuePropertyType” (always 
false) and “isCollection” (false) capture information for the GML application schema 
implementation and are as specified in the GML specification in Annex E. 

- The “IC:…” tagged values provide security classiciation information based on the 
Intelligence Community Metadata Standards for Information Assurance referenced 
from DDMS. See in particular the “Information Security Marking Implementation 
Guide”. 

- The other tagged values are not relevant for classes that are feature types. 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  13
 



OGC 07-028r1 

 

For every attribute of the feature type in the NSG Feature Catalog, one attribute was 
added to the class. Again, the alpha code is used, e.g. “accessibilityStatus”. Attributes 
are typically optional. 

For attributes and association roles the following tagged values are set: 

- “Title”, “primaryCode”, “secondaryCode”, “IC:…” as for feature types. 

- “sequenceNumber” is a unique number within the context of the property as 

14 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

specified in GML Annex E and is used in the GML application schema 
implementation. 

- “inlineOrByReference” specifies the encoding pattern in the GML application 
schema implementation and is set according to the rules in GML Annex E. 

- “isMetadata” specifies whether the value of the property is metadata. This 
information is used in the GML application schema implementation and is set 
according to the rules in GML Annex E, but it may be useful also in other 
implementations. 

- “implementedByNilReason” is also used in the GML application schema 
implementation and is an extension to GML Annex E. It is always false in data 
types. 

 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  15
 



OGC 07-028r1 

A general pattern used for attribute values is that additional metadata (e.g. about 
releasability) may be added or that reasons for missing values (void as specified in 
ISO 10404) may be provided. This is modelled on the conceptual level as 

 

The data type of the attribute (here “TaxiwayAccessibilityStatusCodeMeta”) has a 
property “valueOrReason” with the actual value of the attribute – or a reason for a 
void value. In addition, metadata properties may be added in this type. 

The tagged values described above “Title” (human readable name), “primaryCode” 
(name of class), “noPropertyType” (false), “byValuePropertyType” (true) are set for 
the <<DataType>> class. 

16 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

 

The following figure shows the tagged values for the “valueOrReason” attribute. 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  17
 



OGC 07-028r1 

 

The tagged values for the <<Union>> class are using the same pattern as the 
<<DataType>> class. The only addition is the tagged value “asGroup” which is used 
in the GML application schema implementation and is an extension to GML Annex 
E. It is set to “true” and specifies the union is implemented as a group and not a 
complexType in XML Schema. 

The tagged values of the other classes and attributes follow the pattern described 
above. The only noteworthy setting is in the “reason” property, where “isMetadata” is 
set to “true” as is “implementedByNilReason” which is used in the GML application 
schema implementation to map this property to make value nillable and allow 
qualifying a nil value with a nilReason value. 

Otherwise the following attribute types can be distinguished: 

o Attributes with coded values: In this case, the allowed coded values for the 
respective feature type are captured in a enumeration class (stereotype 
<<Enumeration>>, see TaxiwayAccessibilityStatusType above). Since the 
coded values are different for each class, the uniqueness is guaranteed by 

18 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

naming the class by a concatenation of the feature type name and the attribute 
name. Each coded value is represented with its textual description and code 
value. The same is true for the reasons for void values. 

ISO/TS 19103 distinguishes enumerations (fixed lists of values) and code lists 
(lists of values that can be maintained seperately from the schema). 

Since the allowed values are fixed for a certain version of the NSG Feature 
Catalog, the coded values are modelled as enumerations and not as code lists; 
as a result they are "tied" to the schema (consequently, an XML parser can 
validate if a coded value is allowed or not for a specific feature instance – 
something which would not have been true for a code list approach).  

Still all coded values are also documented in a separate GML dictionary to 
allow for the translation from code value to textual description (and vice 
versa) by applications.   

• Other Attributes: These attributes are attributes with either a string value, a numeric 
value or a complex data type value with sub-elements. String values are often 
associated with a maximum length. Numeric values are often values associated with a 
unit of measurement, a minimum and maximum value. If existing, this information is 
captured in tagged values of classes for the attribute type, which are subtypes of the 
respective ISO/TS 19103 basic type and where the <<BasicType>> stereotype 
indicates a canonical representation in typical implementation platforms as a simple 
type. The class is modelled as a specialisation of the ISO/TS 19103 basic type 
(typically Real, Integer, CharacterString). The tagged values “length”, 
“rangeMinimum” and “rangeMaximum” may be used to provide constraints that may 
be used in the mapping to an implementation platform.

7.3 Information entities 

In addition to the feature types, a number of object types are currently defined in the NSG 
Feature Catalog. They follow the same rules as the feature types but have no stereotype.

OGC 07-028r1 

A special case are the geometry object types (see figure below which does not show all 
properties) which are defined as subtypes of GM_Point/GM_Curve/GM_Surface from 
ISO 19107 (Geographic information – Spatial schema). They also inherit from an abstract 
type “GeometryInfo” which adds the association to the features (ie. every feature can in 
principle have geometies unless additional constraints are provided) and to metadata 
about the geometry.

7.4 Views 

The GSIP also provides a loose grouping mechanism, called“Views”. Information 
entities, in particular feature types, can be associated with one or more views, and those 
views are organized into groups.  Entity views are provided as a means to organize 
subsets of the NSG FC for the purposes of inspecting "similar entities". 

7.5 Open issues 

7.5.1 Codes and dictionary references  

In the enumerations, there is no reference where the description of the meaning of the 
value of the enumerants can be found. So either the application knows where to find the 
dictionary (i.e. is “GSIP-aware”) or this could be encoded as explicitly. Since in this case 
the stability of the list of values is not/cannot be enforced in the schema itself, this would

OGC 07-028r1 

result in the use of the stereotype <<CodeList>> instead of <<Enumeration>> and the 
tagged value “asDictionary” set to ”true”.  

EXAMPLE:  
<conspicuousGroundCategory codeSpace=”URI of the NSG dictionary in the 
appropriate version”>Visual</conspicuousGroundCategory> 

The current verson of the GSIP UML application schema subdivides the documentation 
and can be parsed. For example, the entry for Visual is: "Visual: Conspicuous visually. 
[desc] Conspicuousness by radar unspecified." Here, "[desc]" indication the end of the 
text representing the definition and the start of text providing an additional description. 

In general, the code list ditionaries should reside in a registry so that it can be accessed.  

7.5.2 General relationship between feature catalog and application schema  

Where is the break between an Application Schema and a Feature Catalog?  

The GSIP Access database contains much more than an Application Schema or a Feature 
Catalog.  

When the term Feature Catalog is used, this indicates an ISO 19110 Feature Catalog. It 
does not contain any information about “views” like those specified in the GSIP, etc., as 
these concepts are not defined in ISO 19110.  

The UML model is intended to be an Application Schema, but with a few extensions 
which are represented in tagged values. These additions can be grouped into four aspects:  

• Information from the feature catalog. Examples: codes and name/title of a feature 
type  

• Schema metadata. Examples: DDMS/IC metadata elements that cannot be derived 
from the application schema itself  

• Association of feature types with views (tagged value "Views", also used as 
schema metadata).  

• GML encoding hints. Examples: targetNamespace (from GML 3.2 Annex E), 
isMetadata (from GML 3.2 Annex E), asGroup (extension)  

In general there is overlap between a Feature Catalog (focus: semantics) and an 
Application Schema (focus: structure). E.g., an Application Schema does not only contain 
the structural information, but ISO 19109 requires that "an application schema shall be 
documented."  

This is also an issue in ISO Technical Committee 211 (Geographic 
Information/Geomatics) in general which was brought up in recent discussions and 
different communities have slightly different roles for Feature Catalog and Application 
Schema in their processes.

7.5.3 Creating a units dictionary from DFDD/DTD 

Below is a units dictionary partially filled with contents from the DTD register of 
DGIWG. The comments discuss how the information from the DTD could be 
automatically entered into the dictionary and list the issues with mapping from the DTD 
to a GML “units” dictionary. It is currently unclear how the units section in DGIWG's 
DTD relates to units catalogues/dictionaries as specified in ISO/TS 19139 and ISO 
19136. This topic would need to be discussed with DGIWG, if the units dictionary should 
be derived automatically from the DTD.  

- Every Unit of Measure in the DTD is mapped to a BaseUnit, DerivedUnit or 
ConventionalUnit.  

Issue: It is unclear how the seperation into BaseUnit, DerivedUnit or 
ConventionalUnit can be made based on the information in the DTD. 

- gml:id has been set to the code 

- gml:description has been set to the value of documentation and description separated 
by " Note: ". 

- gml:identifier has been set to the code where the codespace is a URI identifying the 
DTD (perhaps a better and more stable codespace should be used, if one is specified 
by DGIWG)  

- gml:name has been set to the name, the codespace is optional, but should be a URI 
identifying the DTD. 

- gml:quantityType has been set to the name of the associated Quantity Equivalence 
Category, the element contains an informal description of the phenomenon or type of 
physical quantity that is measured or observed. As an alternative, the definition of the 
Quantity Equivalence Category could be added, e.g. in paranthesis. 

- Issue: The usual catalog symbols cannot be determined from the DTD (note that this 
element is optional in the units dictionary and could also be left out, but it may be 
helpful for user interfaces). 

- Issue: The units system cannot be determined from the DTD. 

- Issue: The individual terms of a derived unit cannot be determined from the DTD. 

- Issue: Some conventional units are explicitly expressed in the DTD, e.g. there is gram 
and kilogram, although these are not identifable as such. 

- Issue: The Units multiple information could be used to create combinations for all 
units as a combination of multiple and unit, but this seems too much. 

- Issue: In the conventional units, how to combine the combination of units multiple 
and unit code/name? Concetanating them gives names/codes.

8 GML Application Schema 

8.1 Overview 

The GML Application Schema is automatically derived from the UML application 
schema using the ShapeChange UGAS (UML-to-GML-Application-Schema conversion) 
tool. This can be done in two ways. First, by using the command line interface which 
requires that the UML model is already available. A second method uses the web 
interface and its integrated Catalog Service client by discovering a previously unknown 
model by querying a registry. 

8.2 Using the ShapeChange command line interface 

After exporting the UML model as an XMI 1.0 file, e.g., "gsip_v1.8.xml", the 
ShapeChange tool is executed with the following parameters: 

java -Xms512m -Xmx1424m -jar ShapeChange.jar -M "DDMS" –A "NSGFC" 
–D "TYPE" -v "3.2" -o "GSIP" "gsip_v1.8.xml" 
 
See the ShapeChange documentation  (available at http://www.interactive-
instruments.de/ShapeChange/) for details about the parameters. 

NOTE The Rational Rose UML model of GSIP v1.8 has a file size of ca. 85 MB. The 
exported XMI file has a file size of ca. 400 MB (the export from Rational Rose took 30 
hours on a notebook). The resulting GML application schema has a file size of ca.37 MB 
of which ca. 19 MB are schema metadata (the processing of the XMI file by 
ShapeChange took 12 hours). 

As a result of the operation, the GML application schema and its XML Schema 
documents are created (as well as schema metadata and GML dictionaries for the 
definitions in the application schema). 

In this process ShapeChange reports some warnings which refer to model elements from 
the ISO 19100 model and not from the NSG Feature Catalog. 

The GML application schema should be verified after creation with appropriate tools. In 
OWS-4 this has been done with Xerces-J. 

8.3 Using the ShapeChange web interface and Catalog Service client 

This alternative path uses the same approach as in the previous subclause, however, the 
steps are exectuted using a graphical, web browser-based user interface.

OGC 07-028r1 

In addition, UML models published in Catalog Service registries following the guidelines 
for schema metadata specified in Clause 9 can be discovered through that interface. After 
the GML application schema has been created, the document is uploaded to a http-
accesible ftp repository and the newly created schema can be published in a Catalog 
Service registry following the guidelines for schema metadata.  

See the ShapeChange documentation for details about using the web interface and the 
Catalog Service client. 

8.4 Use of tagged values in the encoding  

In general, GML 3.2 allows for control of how some elements are to be represented in 
GML / XML Schema. There are a number of tagged values for this that have been 
introduced above:  

• For classes:  

o documentation: Used for the textual description of the class.  

o noPropertyType: “true” suppresses the creation of a property type in GML 
(usually should be set only if the class is never a value of another property 
or only references are used to represent associations between objects – see 
below). No action required.  

o byValuePropertyType: “true” creates an additional property type that 
enforces that the object is encoded inline in the property in the XML 
instances. It is not expected that this applies for the GSIP. No action 
required.  

o isCollection: "true" identifies a class as an object collection – note that this 
information is on the type level.  

o asDictionary (only <<CodeList>>): “true” encodes a value as a reference 
to an external dictionary instead of fixing the values in the schema. 
Currently not relevant, but see below.  

• For properties (attributes and association ends):  

o documentation: Used for the textual description of the class. 

o sequenceNumber: Unique value used to enforce that the order of 
properties in the XML Schema is invariant over several runs of the UML-
to-GML process, because properties in UML are unordered.  

o inlineOrByReference: The typical pattern for object-valued properties in 
GML is that the target object can either be embedded inline in the XML 
element of the property or referenced by use of Xlink. Application 
schemas may restrict this to either “inline” (no use of Xlink) or 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  27
 



OGC 07-028r1 

“byReference” (no inline encoding, always Xlinks are used for feature 
associations). Examples of the different encoding styles:  

The encoding using "byReference" is:  
               <FeatureCollection> 
                <member> 
                 <ExtractionMine gml:id="o1"> 
                  <isLocatedInCountry xlink:href="#o2"/> 
                 </ExtractionMine> 
                </member> 
                <member> 
                 <GeopoliticalCountry gml:id="o2"> 
                  <isLocationCountryOf xlink:href="#o1"/> 
                 </GeopoliticalCountry> 
                </member> 
               </FeatureCollection> 

 

The encoding using "inline" would be as follows: 
               <FeatureCollection> 
                <member> 
                 <ExtractionMine gml:id="o1"> 
                  <isLocatedInCountry> 
                   <GeopoliticalCountry gml:id="o2"> 
                    <isLocationCountryOf> 
                     <!-- ExtractionMine is already encoded in the 
        document and cannot be copied here again! --> 
                    </isLocationCountryOf> 
                   </GeopoliticalCountry> 
                  </isLocatedInCountry> 
                 </ExtractionMine> 
                </member> 
               </FeatureCollection> 

 

The default (if neither "inline" or "byReference" is specified in the two 
association roles) would allow any of the following encodings:  

               <FeatureCollection> 
                <member> 
                 <ExtractionMine gml:id="o1"> 
                  <isLocatedInCountry> 
                   <GeopoliticalCountry gml:id="o2"> 
                    <isLocationCountryOf xlink:href="#o1"/> 
                   </GeopoliticalCountry> 
                  </isLocatedInCountry> 
                 </ExtractionMine> 
                </member> 
               </FeatureCollection> 
 
               or 
 
               <FeatureCollection> 
                <member>

                 <GeopoliticalCountry gml:id="o2"> 
                  <isLocationCountryOf> 
                   <ExtractionMine gml:id="o1"> 
                    <isLocatedInCountry xlink:href="#o2"/> 
                   </ExtractionMine> 
                  </isLocationCountryOf> 
                 </GeopoliticalCountry> 
                </member> 
               </FeatureCollection> 
 
               or 
 
               <FeatureCollection> 
                <member> 
                 <ExtractionMine gml:id="o1"> 
                  <isLocatedInCountry xlink:href="#o2"/> 
                 </ExtractionMine> 
                </member> 
                <member> 
                 <GeopoliticalCountry gml:id="o2"> 
                  <isLocationCountryOf xlink:href="#o1"/> 
                 </GeopoliticalCountry> 
                </member> 
               </FeatureCollection> 

For GSIP application schemas, the following rules apply:  

- Every property that has an object as its value that is not a feature shall 
have the object embedded inline. The only exception is when an object 
occurs multiple times in an XML document when the first occurance 
shall be embedded inline and the other instances shall be referenced 
using a bare name Xpointer referencing the gml:id value in the same 
document (e.g., xlink:href="#fe_132"). Therefore, the value has to be 
neither "inline" or "byReference"). Note that this approach has been 
taken due to limitations in the Web Feature Services which only 
provides limited support for objects that are not features. If these will 
be resolved in the future, "byReference" would be used instead. 

- Every property that has a feature as its value shall not embed the 
feature inline, but used a xlink:href reference ("byReference"). 

o isMetadata: “true” for those properties whose value is considered 
metadata, e.g. all properties whose value type is a type specified in ISO 
19115. 

8.5 Additional encoding rules 

8.5.1 General remarks 

This subclause specifies additional encoding rules in addition to GML Annex E.

8.5.2 nillable, nilReasonAllowed and implementedByNilReason 

If an attribute has a tagged value "nillable" with value "true", the property element would 
be defined with "nillable" set to "true".  

If a type has a tagged value "nilReasonAllowed" with value "true", all property types for 
this property would be defined with an optional nilReason attribute.  
If a property of the conceptual model is implemented by the nilReason concept of GML, 
the tagged value “implementedByNilReason” is set. As a result, the following classes  

TaxiwayAccessibili tyStatusCodeMeta
+ valueOrReason : TaxiwayAccessibili tyStatusCodeReason

<<DataType>>

TaxiwayAccessibil ityStatusCodeReason
+ value : TaxiwayAccessibili tyStatusType
+ reason : VoidValueReason

<<Union>>

TaxiwayAccessibil ityStatusType
+ Locked = 1
+ Open = 2
+ ClosedAndLocked = 3
+ OpenAndLocked = 4
+ Limited = 6
+ Closed = 7

<<Enumeration>>
VoidValueReason

+ Unknown = 0
+ ValueSpecified = 995
+ Unpopulated = 997
+ NotApplicable = 998
+ Other = 999

(from Datatypes)

<<Enumeration>>

 

are encoded in the GML application schema as

8.5.3 asGroup 

If a <<Union>> class has a tagged value “asGroup” with a value “true” then it is encoded 
as a global group which is referenced wherever a property is defined that has the union 
class as its value. Note that this is only valid if from the context it is clear how to map the 
individual values to the conceptual model. 

8.5.4 Mixin classes 

Due to the fact that several implementation platforms including XML Schema supports 
only type derivation from a single base type (element substitutablity in XML Schema is 
restricted to a single element, too), the use of multiple inheritance is currently not 
supported by GML 3.2 Annex E. 

However, for conceptual modelling, the ability to define abstract types which capture a 
set of properties that are associated with a concept is sometimes very convenient. 

The following additional rules for such abstract types are therefore supported by 
ShapeChange: 

If a class is a specialization of another class, then this class shall have one of the 
stereotypes <<FeatureType>>, <<DataType>>, no stereotype or <<Type>>.  

The class shall have zero or one supertype with the same stereotype and zero or more 
abstract supertypes of the stereotype <<Type>>. 

I.e., disregarding classes with stereotype <<Type>>, a generalization relationship shall 
be specified only between two classes that are either: 

32 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

- both feature types (stereotype <<FeatureType>>), 

- both object types (no stereotype), or 

- both data types (stereotype <<DataType>>). 

For every class <<Type>> all direct or indirect subtypes shall be either 

- all feature or object types (stereotypes <<FeatureType>>, no stereotype or 
<<Type>>), 

- all data types (stereotypes <<DataType>> or <<Type>>). 

All generalization relationships between classes shall have no stereotype. The 
discriminator property of the UML generalization shall be blank. 

The abstract mixin class (example in the GSIP: GeometryInfo) is encoded as a group with 
all properties (attributes and navigable association ends) encoded as usual. This group 
will be referenced from the subtype. 

EXAMPLE GeometryInfo and PointGeometryInfo:

8.6 Profile of ISO 19107 

The spatial schema to be used in connecion with NSG Feature Catalog feature types is 
restricted to the profile described by the DGIWG/TSMAD Profile of ISO 19107. 

Note that this profile does not include geometric aggregates, therefore, in the application 
schema the data type of spatial geometries are in general specified as 
"Set<GM_(Orientable)XYZ>" instead of "GM_MultiXYZ".  

However, such sets are not specified in the GSIP. In general, GSIP currently uses only 

34 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

GM_Point, GM_Curve and GM_Surface. It does not specify which interpolation types 
are supported or required. 

8.7 GML Profile 

A GML Profile1 was specified reflecting the current usage of base types from the ISO 
19100 series and to be used in conjunction with the application schemas described in this 
document.  

The resulting GML profile is captured in the schema document “gmlNSGProfile.xsd”. It 
is restricted to the GML schema components that are required by the GML application 
schemas in this IPR. 

All deprecated schema components were removed from the profile. 

Note that the GML profile and the rules for GSIP-based application schemas do not 
conform to the GML Simple Feature profile (GML-SF) level 2: 

- GML 3.2.1 is used, not GML 3.1.1. 

- Geometries with non-linear interpolation are allowed. 

Compared to GML Simple Feature level 1, the following additional capabilities are not 
supported:   

- GML objects are required by GSIP,  

- nillable and nilReason are required by GSIP, 

- multiple level of nesting data types are required by GSIP, 

- the use of ISO/TS 19139 is required by GSIP. 

NOTE There are probably more capabilities, but the ones noted above are the major 
ones. 

 

                                                 

1  Since the GML schema offers a wide range of components that may be used by geospatial application schemas, 
almost all application schemas will use only a very limited part of the full GML schema. To specify and document the 
usage of GML by an application schema typically a profile of the GML schema is created and used instead of the full 
schema.

8.8 Profiling ISO 19115 / ISO/TS 19139 

The GML profiling mechanism allows to tailor the GML schema to he specific needs of a 
community, similar requirements exist for metadata. This section discusses how the 
metadata schema from ISO 19115 and in particular its encoding based on ISO/TS 19139 
can be profiled. ISO/TS 19139 distinguishes extensions and restrictions.  

Restrictions:  

ISO/TS 19139 acknoledges in A.4 that "there are certain cases when it is desirable to 
restrict an existing XML Schema." The conformance clause states that user profile 
restrictions should use annotations in UML to express the restricting constraints (this 
implies OCL constraints) and enforce these constraints via a tool other than an XML 
Schema validator.  

One option would be Schematron constraints, however, no rules have been specified how 
OCL constraints could be mapped to Schematron constraints, so the Schematron 
constraints would need to be added along with the OCL constraints, e.g. in tagged values, 
if the Schematron constraints should be derived automatically from the UML model. 

I.e. ISO/TS 19139 profiles are not directly reflected in XML Schema documents.  

The above statements are made in the annex stating the conformance tests. Note that the 
word "should" indicates in principle that this is just a recommendation although since 
they are made in the annex discussing conformance this may also be an error in the 
choice of words. It is probably safer to not create a "profiled" version of the ISO/TS 
19139 schema documents.  

Extensions:  

ISO/TS 19139 uses the word "extension" in the sense that additional classes are being 
specified in UML. Note that this may lead to restrictions in the domain of values, e.g. in 
the example of specifying a code list instead of a free text, for example, when limiting the 
property metadataStandardName in MD_Metadata from a free text string to a list of 
allowed values.  

Based on ISO 19115 the allowed extension mechanisms are discussed below. The 
following discussion assumes that an automated translation from UML to XML Schema 
is intended. As a result, an amended version of the UGAS tool (or a separate tool) would 
need the capability to identify metadata classes/packages and apply the 19139 encoding 
rules instead of the 19136 encoding rules.  

• Adding a new metadata section: To be modelled as a new package and associated 
with its own namespace.  

• Creating a new metadata codelist to replace the domain of an existing metadata 
element that has “free text” listed as its domain value: To be modelled as a 
<<CodeList>> class and encode these as described in ISO/TS 19139 8.5.5. This 
puts the element representing an instance in the substitution group of

OGC 07-028r1 

gco:CharacterString. The result of this is that it can appear everywhere where a 
string is expected and not only as a value of the property for which it was 
intended. I.e. this extension/restriction has no impact on XML Schema validation 
and this constraint must be checked by the application.  

• Creating new metadata codelist elements (expanding a codelist): To be handled in 
the registry - no impact on schemas in UML or GML.  

• Adding a new metadata element: A new subtype of the metadata class that is to be 
extended needs to be defined in a new namespace (might be the application 
schema namespace or a different one - this has to be controlled by the use of 
packages). In the new type new properties (metadata elements) can be created.  

• Adding a new metadata entity: A new type is modelled in UML. It somehow  
needs to be identifyable as a metadata entity so that the appropriate encoding rules 
can be applied.  

This topic is discussed in several communities. Simon Cox has documented some of the 
conclusions of related discussions in his Wiki (see 
https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/twiki/bin/view/AppSchemas/MetadataProfiles).

9.2 Resource "Application Schema"  

9.2.1 Overview 

Every application schema is described by one DDMS metadata resource.  

In most cases, schema metadata that cannot be derived from the model itself will be 
represented in the UML model using the tagged value extension mechanism of UML. 
Depending on the resource, the tagged value is associated with the UML package that 
represents the application schema (packages with stereotype <<Application Schema>>).  

If a tagged value contains a set or list of values, then this collection is encoded by a 
space-seperated list of all elements unless otherwise noted.  

9.2.2 Subject  

9.2.2.1 CS-W property  

Subject (Core queryable property)  

9.2.2.2 DDMS primary category  

Subject (Mandatory)  

9.2.2.3 Representation in the UML application schema  

Three pairs of tagged values are used to represent this information:  

• Tagged value "TopicCategory": The content shall be the set of all entries in the 
tagged value of the same name for the feature types of that application schema.  

• Tagged value "TopicCategoryNamespace": Namespace of the classification / 
controlled vocabulary of the terms used in "TopicCategory". Default value is 
"http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd/MD_TopicCategoryCode". The default value 
should not be changed.  

• Tagged value "Views": The content shall be the set of all entries in the tagged 
value of the same name for the in the feature types of that application schema.  

• Tagged value "ViewsNamespace": Namespace of the classification / controlled 
vocabulary of the terms used in "Views". The value is for the GSIP views (which 
is the vocabulary used in all GSIP-based application schemas) is 
"http://www.nga.mil/gsip/classification/Views".  

• Tagged value "SubjectOther": The content shall be the name of the data content 
standard, i.e. in OWS-4 one of "GSIP", "GlobalMSD", "RegionalMSD", 
"LocalMSD", "UrbanMSD", "DAFIF", "DVOF", or "SAC".  

• Tagged value "SubjectOtherNamespace": Namespace of the classification / 
controlled vocabulary of the terms used in "SubjectOther". In OWS-4, this 

40 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-028r1 

element is used to store the abbreviated name of the data content standards with 
the namespace "http://www.nga.mil/gsip/classification/DataContentStandards".  

Note: the URIs need to be reviewed and are subject to change.  

9.2.2.4 Representation in DDMS (schema metadata)  

For each of the three tagged values a classification shall be established in the catalog. The 
three classifications shall be maintained seperately in the Catalogue Service. The 
namespace qualifiers distinguish between the three vocabularies.  

In DDMS, all values of the three classifications that are associated with the resource shall 
be encoded as ddms:category elements with the appropriate namespace.

9.3 Resource "Feature Type” 

9.3.1 Overview  

Every feature type in a UML application schema is described by one DDMS metadata 
resource.  

In most cases, schema metadata that cannot be derived from the model itself will be 
represented in the UML model using the tagged value extension mechanism of UML. In 
this case, the tagged values are associated with the UML class that represents the feature 
type (class with stereotype <<FeatureType>>).  

If a tagged value contains a set or list of values, then this collection is encoded by a 
space-seperated list of all elements unless otherwise noted.  

9.3.2 Subject

Subject (Core queryable property)  

9.3.2.2 DDMS primary category  

Subject (Mandatory)  

9.3.2.3 Representation in the UML application schema  

Eight tagged values are used to represent this information:  

• Tagged value "TopicCategory": The content shall be the set of all applicable 
values from the MD_TopicCategoryCode enumeration from ISO 19115, i.e.  

o farming  

o biota  

o boundaries  

o climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere  

o economy  

o elevation  

o environment

o utilitiesCommunication  

• Tagged value "Views": The content shall be the set of all applicable values from 
the list of views defined in the GSIP, i.e. those views which are associated with 
ths feature type.  

• Tagged value "SubjectOther": The content shall be the value of the name in the 
tagged value of the same name for the application schema.  

• Tagged value "TopicCategoryNamespace": The content shall be the value of the 
name in the tagged value of the same name for the application schema.  

• Tagged value "ViewsNamespace": The content shall be the value of the name in 
the tagged value of the same name for the application schema.  

• Tagged value "SubjectOtherNamespace": The content shall be the value of the 
name in the tagged value of the same name for the application schema.  

• Tagged value "PrimaryCode": The content shall be the value of the alpha code.  

• Tagged value "SecondaryCode": The content shall be the value of the DFDD 
code.  

9.3.2.4 Representation in DDMS (schema metadata)  

For each of the first six tagged values see 'Subject' for Application Schema resources.  

For the last two tagged values ddms:keyword elements with attributes ddms:value shall 
be created, the value of the tagged value shall be the value of the attribute.

9.5.18 Use of View resources in WFS clients  

The intended process is as follows: 

• A WFS client asks/searches the catalog for available views (which are similar to 
"layers"), eg by using keywords  

• The user selects a view from the return list 

• The WFS client retrieves the feature types that are associated with that view  

• The WFS client constructs GetFeature request with all the feature types in the 
view  

• The WFS client retrieves the features in the view from the WFS  

One issue that was not addressed as part of OWS-4 is the workflow of linking the WFS 
service instances to the views so that the WFS client can easily identify all WFSs which 
are serving the data.
