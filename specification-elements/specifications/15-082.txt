vi. Future Work 
Future work involves coordination with ongoing OGC hydrology standards for surface 
water and time series observations, to demonstrate how these emerging standards can 
operate together. 

1. Scope 

This document is a conceptual and encoding specification for the representation of core 
groundwater data. GroundWaterML2 is implemented as an application schema of the 
Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.2.1, and re-uses entities from other GML 
application schema, most notably the OGC Observations & Measurements standard and 
the GeoSciML 3.2.0 standard from the International Union of Geological Sciences 
(IUGS). 

GroundWaterML2.1 (GWML2) is designed to enable a variety of data exchange 
scenarios. These scenarios are captured by its five motivating use cases, including:  

(1) a commercial use-case focused on drilling water wells with knowledge of 
aquifers; 

(2) a policy use case concerned with the management of groundwater resources; 
(3) an environmental use-case that considers the role of groundwater in natural eco-

systems; 
(4) a scientific use-case concerned with modeling groundwater systems; and  
(5) a technologic use-case concerned with interoperability between diverse 

information systems and associated data formats.  

GWML2 is designed in three stages, each consisting of a schema that builds on the 
previous stages. The three schemas include: 

(1) Conceptual (UML): a technology-neutral schema denoting the semantics of the 
domain; 

(2) Logical (UML): a GML-specific schema that incorporates the OGC suite of 
standards; and 

(3) XML schema (XSD): a GML syntactical encoding of the logical schema.  
In addition, this specification describes general and XML-specific encoding 
requirements, general and XML-specific conformance tests, and XML encoding 
examples. The specification is designed for future extension into other non-XML 
encoding syntaxes, which would require each such encoding to describe the related 
schema, requirements and conformance classes, as well as provide examples. 

The GroundWaterML2 Logical and XML schemas are organized into 6 modular 
packages. 

(1) GWML2-Main: core elements such as aquifers, their pores, and fluid bodies.  



OGC 15-082 

13 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

(2) GWML2-Constituent: the biologic, chemical, and material elements of a fluid 
body. 

(3) GWML2-Flow: groundwater flow within and between containers. 
(4) GWML2-Well: water wells, springs, and monitoring sites. 
(5) GWML2-WellConstruction: the components used to construct a well. 
(6) GWML2-AquiferTest: the elements composing an aquifer test (e.g. pumping test). 

Altogether, the schemas and packages represent a precise description of the key features 
associated with the groundwater domain, as well as their properties and relationships. 
This provides a semantics and syntax for the correct machine interpretation of the data, 
which promotes proper use of the data in further analysis. Existing systems can use 
GWML2 to ‘bridge’ between existing schema or systems, allowing consistency of the 
data to be maintained and enabling interoperability. 

1.1 Motivation 
A significant portion of the global water supply can be attributed to groundwater 
resources. Effective management of such resources requires the collection, management 
and delivery of related data, but these are impeded by issues related to data availability, 
distribution, fragmentation, and heterogeneity: collected data are not all readily available 
and accessible, available data is distributed across many agencies in different sectors, 
often thematically fragmented, and similar types of data are diversely structured by the 
various data providers. This situation holds both within and between political entities, 
such as countries or states, thereby impairing groundwater management across all 
jurisdictions. Groundwater data networks are an emerging solution to this problem as 
they couple data providers through a unified data delivery vehicle, thus reducing or 
eliminating distribution, fragmentation, and heterogeneity through the incorporation of 
standards for data access and data content. The relative maturity of OGC data access 
standards, such as the Web Feature Service (WFS) and Sensor Observation Service 
(SOS), combined with the rise of water data networks, have created a need for 
GroundWaterML2 (GWML2), a common groundwater data specification. 

1.2 Historical background 
Several activities have influenced the development of GWML2: 

 GWML1: a GML application schema for groundwater data developed at Natural 
Resources Canada used to exchange groundwater data within Canada, between 
Canada and the USA, and in some other international initiatives (Boisvert & 
Brodaric, 2012). 

 GWIE1: an interoperability experiment within the OGC HDWG, in which 
groundwater data was shared across the USA-Canada border (Brodaric & Booth, 
2011). 

 INSPIRE Data Specification on Geology: a conceptual model for geology and 
hydrogeology with regulatory force in the European Union (INSPIRE, 2013), and 
for which GWML2 is expected to be an encoding candidate.

2. Conformance 

This specification has been written to be compliant with the OGC Specification Model – 
A Standard for Modular Specification (OGC 08-131r3). Extensions of this specification 
shall themselves be conformant to the OGC Specification Model. 

2.1 XML implementation 
The XML implementation (encoding) of the conceptual and logical groundwater schemas 
is described using the XML Schema language and Schematron.  

Requirements for one standardization target type are considered: 

- data instances 
i.e. XML documents that encode groundwater data. As data producing applications 
should generate conformant data instances, the requirements and tests described in this 
specification effectively also apply to that target.  

Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified 
in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology 
for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in ISO 
19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing. In order to conform to this 
OGC™ encoding specification, a standardization target shall implement the core 
conformance class, and choose to implement any one of the other conformance classes 
(i.e. extensions). 

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned 
by the standard(s) identified. 

2.2 Use of vocabularies 
Controlled vocabularies, also known as code-lists, are used in data exchange to identify 
particular concepts or terms, and sometimes relationships between them. For example, an 
organization may define a controlled vocabulary for all observed phenomena, such as 
water quality parameters, that are to be exchanged between parties. Some of these 
definitions may be related by hierarchies or through other relationships such as 
equivalence. 

GroundWaterML2.1 does not define a set of vocabularies for groundwater data exchange 
in this version. It is envisaged that specific communities will develop local vocabularies 
for data exchange within the community. Future work within the Hydrology Domain 
Working Group could address standardized controlled vocabularies for the groundwater 
domain. Such vocabularies require a governance structure that allows changes to be made 
as definitions evolve, possibly using the OGC definition namespace 
(http://www.opengis.net/def/groundwaterml/2.1/), which is governed by the OGC 
Naming Authority (OGC-NA). The OGC-NA is responsible for processing requests to 
change or add new definitions to this namespace. The procedures for the OGC-NA are 



OGC 15-082

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

outlined in OGC document 09-046 (OGC-NA – Procedures) and the structure of URIs is 
outlined in OGC 09-048 (OGC-NA – Name type specification – definitions).  

2.3 Groundwater data 
Groundwater data conforming to this specification are encoded in GML-conformant 
XML documents, for this version of GWML2. It is anticipated that future versions or 
extensions will develop additional encodings such as JSON or RDF.  The standard 
MIME-type and sub-type for GML data should be used to indicate the encoding choice as 
specified in MIME Media Types for GML, namely 

application/gml+xml.

5. Conventions 

5.1 Requirements class 
Each normative statement (requirement or recommendation) in this specification is a 
member of a requirements class. Each requirements class is described in a discrete clause 
or sub-clause, and summarized using the following template: 

Requirements class /req/{classM} 

Target type [artefact or technology type] 

Dependency [identifier for another requirements 
class] 

Requirement /req/{classM}/{reqN} 

Recommendation /req/{classM}/{recO} 

Requirement /req/{classM}/{reqP} 



OGC 15-082 

20 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Requirement 
/Recommendation 

[repeat as necessary] 

 

All requirements in a class must be satisfied. Hence, the requirements class is the unit of 
re-use and dependency, and the value of a dependency requirement is another 
requirements class. All requirements in a dependency must also be satisfied by a 
conforming implementation. A requirements class may consist only of dependencies and 
introduce no new requirements.  

5.2 Requirement 
All requirements are normative, and each requirement is presented using the following 
template: 

/req/[classM]/[reqN] [Normative statement] 

 

where /req/[classM]/[reqN] identifies the requirement or recommendation. The use of this 
layout convention allows the normative provisions of this specification to be easily 
located by implementers.  

5.3 Conformance class 
Conformance to this specification is possible at a number of levels, specified by 
conformance classes (Annex A). Each conformance class is summarized using the 
following template:  

Conformance class /conf/{classM} 

Dependency [identifier for another conformance 
class] 

Requirements /req/{classA} 

Tests [reference to clause(s) containing 
tests] 

 

All tests in a class must be passed. Each conformance class tests conformance to a set of 
requirements packaged in a requirements class. 

W3C Schema (XSD) and ISO Schematron (SCH) files are considered as part of this 
specification, although available online only, due to concerns about document size. Many 
requirements are expressed in a single XSD or SCH file although tests are listed 
individually in the conformance annex (one test for XSD and one test for SCH).   



OGC 15-082 

21 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Schematron files explicitly specify which requirements are being tested in the title of the 
Schematron pattern. 

 

<pattern id="origin_elevation"> 
  <title>Test requirement: /req/gwml2-well-xsd/origin_elevation</title> 
  <rule context="gwml2w:GW_Well"> 
   <assert 
test="count(gwml2w:gwWellReferenceElevation/gwml2w:Elevation[gwml2w:elevationType/@xlink:
href='http://www.opengis.net/req/gwml2-well/origin_elevation']) = 1">A GW_Well needs at 
least one origin Elevation</assert> 
  </rule> 
 </pattern> 

5.4 Identifiers 
Each requirements class, requirement and recommendation is identified by a URI. The 
identifier supports cross-referencing of class membership, dependencies, and links from 
each conformance test to the requirements tested. In this specification identifiers are 
expressed as partial URIs or paths, which can be appended to a base URI that identifies 
the specification as a whole in order to construct a complete URI for identification in an 
external context. 

The URI for each requirements class has the form  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.1/req/[classM]. 

The URI for each requirement or recommendation has the form 

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.1/req/[classM]/[reqN]. 

The URI for each conformance class has the form 

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.1/conf/[classM]. 

The URI for each conformance test has the form 

http://www.opengis.net/spec/groundwaterml/2.1/conf/[classM]/[testN].

identifier. Recommendations are not tested but are assigned URLs and are identified 
using the ‘Recommendation’ label in the associated requirements table. 

Requirements classes are separated into their own clauses, named, and specified 
according to inheritance (direct dependencies). The Conformance test classes in the test 
suite are similarly named to establish an explicit and mnemonic link between 
requirements classes and conformance test classes. 

6. Background 

6.1 Technical Basis 
This specification builds on a number of standards for encoding XML data, including: 

 OMXML (OGC 10-025r1) 
 sweCommon (OGC 08-094r1) 
 GML  ISO 19136:2007 (OGC 07-036) 
 ISO 19139 (Metadata) 
 W3C XSD 

This specification also builds on existing schema, primarily Observations & 
Measurements (OMXML) and GeoSciML 3.2. It accomplishes this by (a) extending 
these schemas with groundwater specializations, (b) referring to a class in these schema 
in order to type a named property, or (c) using a class from the schemas as one of the two 
participants in a binary relationship. 

6.2 Overview of Observations & Measurements  
ISO19156 – Observations and Measurements is a generic GML schema for observations. 
As shown in Figure 1, it defines an observation as “…an act associated with a discrete 
time instant or period through which a number, term or other symbol is assigned to a 
phenomenon. It involves application of a specified procedure, such as a sensor, 
instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, 
or ex-situ with respect to the sampling location. The result of an observation is an 
estimate of the value of a property of some feature.”  

6.3 Sampling features 
Sampling features in O&M are defined as a “feature, such as a station, transect, section 
or specimen, which is involved in making observations concerning a domain feature.” 
Sampling features in the groundwater domain are features along which, or upon, 
observations are made. The most relevant are water wells and boreholes, which 
effectively host observations along staged intervals; a collection of these intervals and 
their observations constitutes a log.

Figure 1: Observation in O&M. 

6.4 Overview of GeoSciML 3.2  
GeoSciML is a GML schema for core geological entities including geological units, 
structures, and earth materials. It is particularly relevant to GWML2 because bodies of 
rock serve as containers for subsurface water bodies. Such rock bodies possess variable 
hydrogeologic properties according to their material composition and topological 
organization. Thus, geological units and earth materials are the key GeoSciML entities 
required by GWML2.  

GeoSciML defines a geological unit as “a body of material in the Earth whose complete 
and precise extent is inferred to exist (NADM GeologicUnit, Stratigraphic unit in sense of 
NACSN or International Stratigraphic Code), or a classifier used to characterize parts of 
the Earth (e.g. lithologic map unit like 'granitic rock' or 'alluvial deposit', surficial units 
like 'till' or 'old alluvium').”  

GeoSciML defines an earth material as “naturally occurring substance in the Earth” and 
intuitively refers to various types of rocks such as sandstone, granite, and gneiss.

7. Conceptual Model 

The GWML2 conceptual model is designed to be technology-neutral, and focused on the 
semantics of the groundwater domain. It consists of five components, as well as related 
properties and other entities: hydrogeological units, fluid bodies, voids, fluid flow, and 
wells. Conceptually, these entities form a simple template for a subsurface water 
container: the fluid container (a unit or its materials), the fluid itself (fluid body), the 
spaces in the container occupied by the fluid (void), the flow of fluid within and between 
containers and their spaces (flow), and the natural and artificial artifacts used to 
withdraw, inject, or monitor fluid with respect to a container (wells, springs, monitoring 
sites). 

Well construction details are excluded from the conceptual model, but are included in the 
logical model for two reasons: (1) thematic, inasmuch as well construction was 
considered on the periphery of groundwater science, but important to resource 
management, and (2) practical, as it is sufficiently modeled in GWML1 and could thus be 
directly imported with few changes. This eliminates the need for its re-conceptualization 
in the GWML2 conceptual model, thereby keeping it parsimonious. 

7.1 Hydrogeological Units 
These are distinct volumes of earth material that serve as containers for subsurface fluids. 
The boundaries of a unit are typically discriminated from those of another unit using 
properties related to the potential or actual ability to contain or move water. The 
properties can be geological or hydraulic, and typically include influences from the 
surrounding hydrological environment. More specifically, the conceptual model 
delineates two types of hydrogeological units, with slightly different orientations: 
aquifer-related units have boundaries delimited by the hydrogeological properties of the 
rock body, while groundwater basins have boundaries delimited by distinct flow regimes. 
Aquifer-related units are subdivided into aquifer systems, which are collections of 
aquifers, confining beds, and other aquifer systems. Confining beds are units that impede 
water flow to surrounding units, and supersede notions such as aquitards, aquicludes, and 
aquifuges, which are not included herein, as it is difficult to differentiate these in practice. 

Several significant properties are typically attributed to hydrogeological units, such as 
porosity, permeability, and conductivity, but these and others are modeled more 
accurately here as occurring necessarily concurrent with (dependent on) voids or fluid 
bodies. For example, porosity, in its various forms, requires both the presence of a unit 
(container) and its voids, as it is typically defined as the proportion of void volume to 
total unit volume (i.e. volume of solid material plus voids). Likewise, properties such as 
hydraulic conductivity and yield require the presence of units and fluid bodies, as they 
are concerned with the rate of movement of a fluid through a unit. Note that permeability 
and hydraulic conductivity are differentiated here: permeability refers to intrinsic 
permeability, which measures the ability of a unit to host fluid flow, independent of fluid 
properties and based solely on the connectivity and size of voids, whereas hydraulic 
conductivity additionally considers fluid properties. 



OGC 15-082 

27 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Likewise, management areas are also relational entities in the sense that they are typically 
necessarily linked with a unit (or system) and possibly a fluid body. Management areas 
are earth bodies identified for groundwater management purposes and their boundaries 
can be delineated by social factors, such as policy or regulation, in addition to physical 
factors related to hydrogeology or hydrology.    

7.2 Fluid Bodies 
These are distinct bodies of fluid (liquid or gas) that fill the voids in hydrogeological 
units. Fluid bodies are made of biologic (e.g. organisms), chemical (e.g. solutes), or 
material constituents (e.g. sediment). While it is expected that the major constituent of a 
fluid body will be water, the conceptual model allows for other types of major 
constituents such as petroleum. Minor constituents are not necessarily fluids, but can be 
gases, liquids, or solids, and are included in the fluid body in various forms of mixture, 
such as solution, suspension, emulsion, and precipitates. Fluid bodies can also have other 
fluid bodies as parts, such as plumes or gas bubbles. Surfaces can be identified on a fluid 
body, such as a water table, piezometric or potentiometric surface, and some such 
surfaces can contain divides, which are lines projected to the fluid surface denoting 
divergence in the direction of flow systems. 

7.3 Voids 
Voids are the spaces inside a unit (e.g. aquifer) or its material (e.g. the sandstone material 
of an aquifer), and might contain fluid bodies. Voids are differentiated from porosity, in 
that porosity is a ratio of void volume to total volume of unit plus voids, while voids are 
the spaces themselves. It is important to conceptually differentiate voids from units and 
their containers, in order to represent, for example, the volume of fractures, caves, or 
pores in a particular unit or portion thereof.  

7.4 Flow 
Groundwater flow denotes the process by which a fluid enters or exits a container (unit) 
or its voids, or flows within them. Flow between one container or void and another is 
named InterFlow, and flow within a container or void is named IntraFlow. Recharge is 
the flow into a groundwater container or void, and discharge is flow out of a groundwater 
container or void. The reciprocal source or destination entity can be any appropriate 
container or void such as a river, lake, pipe, dam, canyon, flood plain, etc. A flow system 
is then a collection of flows ordered in a sequence from recharge to discharge, such that 
the flow segments of the system make up a connected flow path from source to 
destination. A water budget is a measure of the balance of recharge and discharge valid 
for a specific time and relative to a specific groundwater feature, such as a basin, aquifer, 
management area, or well.  

7.5 Wells 
Well-related entities include water wells, springs, and monitoring sites. Water wells are 
man-made constructions for monitoring, withdrawing, or injecting water from/into a 
hydrogeological unit, while springs are features where water discharges to the surface 
naturally. Both wells and springs possess important links to the hydrogeological 
environment, including their host units and materials, as well as the intersecting fluid 



OGC 15-082

body. Monitoring sites are locations where devices are placed to measure various 
properties of significance to hydrogeology, such as water level, flow rate, water 
temperature, or chemical composition, or to take samples. As such, monitoring sites are 
roles played by other features, for example, water wells or springs.

7.6.1 DocumentCitation 
The class DocumentCitation is abstract, and has no attributes, operations or associations. 
It serves as a placeholder for legislative and reference documentation for a management 
area. Legislative documentation refers to the legal instrument or document that required 
the establishment of the management area. Reference documentation might describe the 
environmental objectives and measures that are to be undertaken in the management area 
to protect the environment (a reference to a management or action plan), licensing 
information, and associated maps. 

The 'Legislation References' and 'DocumentCitation' classes from the INSPIRE Generic 
Conceptual Model are possible candidates for DocumentCitation.

There are several types of yield, that can be considered: specific yield, sustainable yield, 
safe yield, aquifer yield, etc.  

Attribute Type and Multiplicity Definition 

gwYieldType  YieldType   Type of aquifer yields: e.g. specific yield, safe 
yield, etc.   

gwYield  Measurement   Measurement of the yield in units of volume per 
unit of time.

8. Logical Model 

The logical model differs from the conceptual model through the introduction of 
technology-specific artifacts from the OGC General Reference Model and derived 
schemas. These include additions such as classes, relations, properties, constraints, and 
usage principles. Another difference is the incorporation of the well construction package 
from GWML1.  

The logical model is not a syntactical encoding, but is an OGC-compliant schema that is 
syntax-neutral. Syntactical encodings are derived from the logical model, such as the 
reference GML encoding described herein. 

The addition of OGC constructs to the conceptual model amounts to the integration of 
several OGC-compliant GML schemas, primarily GeoSciML 3.2 and Observations & 
Measurements, but also MD_Metadata and others. These are adapted using the following 
strategies. 

(1) HydrogeologicalUnit in GWML2 specializes GeologicUnit from GeoSciML, 
recognizing that in its most basic sense a hydrogeological unit is a body of rock (a 
geological unit) exhibiting some hydrogeological properties including possibly 
fluid storage and transfer. 

(2) Water wells and boreholes specialize O&M:SF_SamplingCurve, which allows 
them to have a shape described by 3D points at the start and end of each segment 
along the well or borehole. Wells and boreholes differ by purpose and use: 
boreholes are physical engineering artifacts consisting of a hole and potentially 
materials fitted inside the hole for some human use, and wells are constructions 
for the extraction or injection of water from/into the ground, and have specific 
hydrogeological properties such as water yield and intended use. As a 
consequence, well and associated borehole lengths can differ for the same well. A 
well can be seen as a specific role played by a borehole. 

(3) Property values are assigned datatypes from O&M: numeric properties are 
assigned the OM_Measurement datatype, and properties that can be either 
numeric or categorical are assigned the Observation datatype. Two factors compel 
these choices: method metadata can be added to each value to describe 
determination of the value, and each property can be further soft-typed for greater 
precision. An example of the latter is the porosity property, which in practical 
situations could refer to any of a wide range of porosity types such as effective 
porosity, primary porosity, or secondary porosity. 

(4) Fluid body constituent values are modeled as observations: for example, a 
chemical analysis of a groundwater sample might be represented in the following 
way: 

 Each measured value is the result of an observation. 
 The observedProperty would be e.g. “As_Concentration” 
 The featureOfInterest would be an instance of e.g. 

GW_ChemicalConstituent with ChemicalTypeTerm = “As” and gwState = 
“solid”.

This approach is quite flexible: it allows for different mixture types (e.g. 
suspension, solution, emulsion), states (i.e. liquid, solid, gas), and measurement 
types (e.g. concentration) for a constituent type (e.g. “As”). 

(5) Aquifer Tests are completely modelled using O&M, except for the single 
signature class GW_AquiferTest. This class is a property-less extension of O&M 
Sampling Feature.  The logical model for Aquifer Test is thus the O&M logical 
model, as illustrated further in Figure 16. Time series generated by aquifer tests 
are represented using WaterML 2.0 (OGC 10-125r4). 

(6) DocumentCitation is replaced by Any type (i.e. the ‘documentation’ role is 
assigned a datatype of Any), in order to satisfy the original intention of the 
DocumentCitation class of enabling re-use of relevant classes from other 
schemas. This allows, for example, use of classes such as GW_Licence, 
MD_Metadata, INSPIRE’s DocumentCitation or LegislativeReferences for 
documentation. 

The logical model is organized into six application schema packages, as mentioned in 
Section 1: 

(1) GWML2-Main: core items, e.g. aquifers, their pores, fluid bodies, management 
areas.  

(2) GWML2-Constituent: the biologic, chemical, and material elements of a fluid 
body. 

(3) GWML2-Flow: fluid flow within and between containers, and water budgets. 
(4) GWML2-Well: water wells, springs, and monitoring sites. 
(5) GWML2-WellConstruction: the components used to construct a borehole or well. 
(6) GWML2-AquiferTest: aspects associated with an aquifer test. 

Because most of the differences between the logical and conceptual models can be 
inferred directly from the logical model UML diagrams, all diagrams are included below. 
Complete class descriptions are subsequently included only for additions to the 
conceptual model, mainly borehole construction elements and geology logs.

AquiferTest describes the inputs, outputs, and 
methods associated with an aquifer test.

Inputs include a collection of sampling features 
(e.g. wells) and the observations made at those 
features, with the features differentiated by roles, 
e.g. pumping well, observation well, etc. The 
features are linked to an aquifer test via 
relatedSamplingFeature, the roles are identified 
by SamplingFeatureComplex, and a feature and 
its observations are linked via relatedObservation.

Outputs include aquifer properties, such as 
transmissivity, which are also represented as 
observations. If the output property is calculated 
(typically), then it is l inked to input observations via 
relatedObservation, with the role specifed via 
ObservationContext (e.g. input, calculated result, 
etc.)

Methods used to carry out the aquifer test are 
described via OM_Process.

Data collected during an aquifer test are 
modeled as OM_Observation (including 
WaterML2 timeseries) taken at some 
sampling feature (e.g. a well). Features 
and observations are linked via 
relatedObservation.

ObservationContext l inks 
observations made during an 
aquifer test with aquifer 
properties calculated from the 
observations, such as 
transmissivity, etc.

9. Requirements Classes (normative) 

This section describes requirement classes for any target implementation conforming to 
GWML2.  Target implementations must meet related conformance class tests for at least 
one concrete requirements class (in Sections 9.2 and greater).  The core requirement 
class (Section 9.1) is abstract, therefore solely meeting the core requirements is 
insufficient to claim compliance with GWML2. Note, this section documents only those 
requirements that cannot be read directly from the UML logical model—the logical 
model denotes the first suite of canonical requirements, which are supplemented by 
those below. 

9.1 Abstract requirements classes: GWML2 core logical model 
This core requirement class describes requirements that must be met by all target 
implementations that claim compliance with GWML2 (this specification).  It also sets 
common requirements for all extensions of this specification.  Since this requirement 
class is abstract, a conformant target implementation SHALL also implement at least one 
concrete requirements class from Sections 9.2 and greater.

9.2.1 Feature of interest for Association classes 
OM_Observation is extensively used to represent property values wherever metadata 
supporting the result is deemed useful.  As stated in ISO19156/OGC 10-004r3, the 
OM_Observation’s feature of interest should be the bearer of the observed property (10-
004r3, clause 7.2.2.7). All properties in GWML 2.1 that use OM_Observation in the 
model are carried by Features; the relationship between the observation and the bearer of 
properties is obvious, except for two cases: GW_UnitFluidProperty (Figure 17) and 
GW_UnitVoidProperty (Figure 18). 

GW_FluidProperty is an association class linking a GW_HydroGeoUnit and a 
GW_FluidBody and carries properties that are inherently related to the association of a 
geological unit and the fluid occupying its voids.  Not being a feature, this class cannot be 
the feature of interest of the properties it bears.

Figure 17: Observation as property values of GW_UnitFluidProperties. 

Traditionally, those properties (gwHydraulicConductivity, gwStorativity, 
gwTransmissivity and gwYield) are assigned by convenience to the hydrogeological unit 
(GW_HydrogeoUnit) because the fluid as a body of groundwater that is rarely identified. 
It is therefore proposed that the feature of interest of all the values of 
GW_UnitFluidProperty SHALL be the instance at the gwFluidBodyUnit end of the 
association. 

/req/gwml2-main/observed-
unit-fluid-property-foi 

The feature of interest of OM_Measurement values for 
GW_UnitFluidProperty properties (gwHydraulicConductivity, 
gwStorativity, gwTransmissivity and gwYield) SHALL be the 
GW_HydrogeoUnit instance at the gwFluidBodyUnit end of the 
GW_UnitFluidProperty association. 

 

GW_UnitVoidProperty is an association class linking a GW_HydroGeoUnit and a 
GW_HydrogeoVoid that carries properties that are inherently related to the association of 
a geological unit and the voids (Figure 18).

Figure 18 : Association class between a GW_HydrogeoUnit and GW_HydrogeoVoid. 

Void properties are traditionally assigned to the hydrogeologic unit, while they are in 
reality a measurement of the relation between a unit and its voids.  For convenience, the 
feature of interest of the OM_Measurement values of the properties SHALL link to the 
feature at the gwVoidUnit end of the association.

The shape of the well is a 3D curve, in absolute coordinates, that represents the path of 
the hole in the ground.  However, it is common practice to position observations, 
construction artefacts, and properties of the surrounding materials along this 3D path 
using a 1D coordinate system relative to the beginning of the hole.  Although most wells 
are often assumed to be straight vertical bores, this standard allows for the generic case, 
where the well path is not a straight line, and therefore any such property or element 
needs to refer to the well path to calculate its absolute position.  

This standard also provides alternative representations for commonly used origin 
elevations, such as the location of the well on the surface of the earth, the location and 
elevation of the well collar, the reference elevation for down hole properties, etc.  Note 
that the reference elevation and the well path are distinct reference elements but it is best 
practice to ensure that the reference elevation point intersect the path.  Because of the 
variety of practices and because the reference elevation can actually change over time 
(replaced headwork, subsidence, etc.) it is not always possible to have a definitive 
reference elevation. 

Several GW_Well features need to be located relative to the well path: 

 GW_GeologyLog LogValue 
 Construction elements 
 Any related Observation 
 Any related SamplingFeature 

The following set of requirements defines how to report these values. 



OGC 15-082 

95 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The elevation CRS must be a relevant EPSG vertical (1 dimension) CRS. Example: 
EPSG:5100 (Mean Sea Level : http://epsg.io/5100-datum). 

/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-
elevationCRS 

GW_Well:gwWellReferenceElevation/Elevation:elevation CRS SHALL have 
a vertical datum. 

9.5.2 Well shape 
/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-
shape 

GW_Well:shape SHALL be a 3D geometry that represents the complete 
well that includes any elements above the ground 

9.5.3 Relative position 
The relative positions of all elements positioned relative to the 3D shape shall be 
calculated from the origin point of that shape, which is the first vertex of the shape. 

The relative position is the linear distance along the bore path, expressed as a positive 
value, using the uom inferred from the CRS of the shape z axis (metres or feet in the vast 
majority of cases). Different GW_Well elements may have different ways to encode the 
relative positions. 

9.5.3.1 Observations 
Any Observation that needs to be positioned along the well path must provide a reference 
geometry (a GM_Curve) and a position along that curve.  In a case where the path is the 
path of the well or a borehole, the reference geometry is expected to be the shape of the 
well or the borehole, but it is not required.  For instance, the relative location can be a 
“virtual path” somewhat related to a well or a group of wells. 

/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-
observation-spatial-reference 

The reference geometry of an Observation SHALL be encoded in a 
om:NamedValue with the name http://www.opengis.net/req/ gwml2-
well/waterwell-observation-spatial-reference and a value of type 
GM_Curve. 

 

The relative position shall be encoded in a specially named NamedValue. 

/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-
observation-fromparam 

The boundary of the interval closest to the well path origin, the “from” 
distance, SHALL be encoded in a om:NamedValue with the name-
http://www.opengis.net/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-observation-
fromparam  and a value of type swe:Quantity 

/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-
observation-toparam

distance, SHALL be encoded in a om:NamedValue with the name

reference GM_Curve and the relative position using sams:parameter

well/waterwell-sf-spatial-reference and a value of type GM_Curve. 

 

The relative position shall be encoded in specially labelled NamedValue. 

/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-sf-
fromparam 

The boundary of the interval, closest to the well path origin, the “from” 
distance, SHALL be encoded in a om:NamedValue with the name 
http://www.opengis.net/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-sf-
fromparam  and a value of type swe:Quantity 

/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-sf-

The boundary of the interval farthest from the well path origin, the “to” 
distance, SHALL be encoded in a om:NamedValue with the name-
http://www.opengis.net/req/gwml2-well/waterwell-sf-toparam  and a 
value of type swe:Quantity 

9.5.4 Geology Log 
GW_GeologyLog is an OM_Observation, with a start and end depth, that shall capture 
downhole geological observations (including geophysical and geochemical) using the 
gwml:gwWellGeology property rather than other OM_Observation properties. 

/req/gwml2-well/well-geology gwWellGeology SHALL associate GW_Well and any 
GW_GeologyLog  

 

The geologic log is encoded as a GW_GeologyLogCoverage. 

/req/gwml2-well/log-coverage The value of om:result of GW_GeologyLog SHALL be a 
GW_GeologyLogCoverage 

 

The GW_GeologyLogCoverage/LogValue is positioned at the origin of the support 
feature, which is a SF_SamplingCurve. 

/req/gwml2-well/log-geometry-
origin 

The origin of the GW_GeologyLogCoverage/LogValue location 
SHALL be the first vertex of the GW_Well shape 

 

Depth shall be expressed as linear distance from the first vertex of the GM_Curve.  When 
the featureOfInterest is a GW_Well, the origin is implicitly gwWellLocation + Elevation. 

/req/gwml2-well/log-depth The fromDepth and toDepth of a LogValue SHALL be the linear 
distance along the path from featureOfInterest’s linear geometry 

 

The fromDepth must be nearest the reference elevation. 

/req/gwml2-well/log-depth-order The fromDepth of a LogValue SHALL be the closest along the path 
to gw_WellReferenceElevation while the toDepth shall be the

9.5.5 Monitoring Sites 
Elevation CRS must be a relevant EPSG vertical (1 dimension) CRS. Example 
EPSG:5100 (Mean Sea Level : http://epsg.io/5100-datum). 

/req/gwml2-well/monitoring-

reference BoreCollar shall have a collarElevationType equal to 
http://www.opengis.net/req/gwml2-construction/construction-origin-elevation.  

Note that this BoreCollar need not be a physical feature, but would normally coincide 
with one.  In a typical instance, we would find 2 or more collars, one or more real 
physical features, and another one as the reference collar that might or might not match 
one of the physical collars.

A vertical well is a special case where the shape of the well is a straight vertical line.  The 
rationale to create a special profile is to inform the data consumer that calculation of 
relative position into absolute position can be greatly simplified.  Vertical wells are very 
common and several groundwater applications expect them to be vertical.     
GW_Well:shape shall have only 2 vertices. 

/req/gwml2-vertical-

Recommendation /req/gwml2-well-geologicLog/log-definition 

 

Geological logs are modelled as GML discrete coverages 
(CV_DiscreteElementCoverage) of elements of type LogValue.  Each Log Value is 
composed of a pair of properties to locate the element along the Well path (fromDepth 
and toDepth) and a SWE DataRecord that contains an arbitrary set of fields to report 
properties of interest along the path (see Figure 20).  

 

 

Figure 20 : SWE Data Record. 

SWE (Clause 7.3 of OGC 08-094r1) describes the requirements to encode a DataRecord. 
A community that defined a common Geologic Log encoding should agree on a 
definition and scoped name for the DataRecord, and definitions of the individual fields 
composing the record.

For example, a community that wants to use GeoSciML vocabulary to encode a geology 
log can agree on a field type (eg: SWE Category) and a definition (a URI) to flag that 
field in the DataRecord as having controlled content.  Another community might chose to 
constrain the complete DataRecord by agreeing on the scoped name of the DataRecord 
itself.

Aquifer hydraulic parameters are routinely evaluated by a series of tests that involves 
pumping or injecting water at known rates and by observing the changes in the water 
table.  Other tests might involve injecting a tracer (radio element or dye) at some location 
and follow its progression at observation points.  From these observations, various 
methods have been developed to compute aquifer properties.  To adequately report an 
aquifer test, the data about initial conditions, test parameters, sampling features, 
measured and calculated observation must be packaged and put into context.

is performed at a test site (the GW_AquiferTest defines a geometry corresponding to the 
test location) and consists of sampling features (usually the GW_Well) that are associated 
to the GW_AquiferTest through relatedSamplingFeature.  Each sampling feature has a 
role in the test (observation or test features). Some sampling features are sites where test 
activities are performed (referred to as “test feature”), such as pumping water out of a 
bore. Other features are sites where more passive observations are made, such as 
measuring the impact of pumping made at the test sampling feature on the water table. 
From this activity, a series of observation are made, typically time series along the 
timespan of the test. Then from these observations, a method is used to infer some aquifer 
properties (such as transmissivity, storativity or yield).  The findings are then documented 
in a report that can be attached to GW_AquiferTest using generic metadata properties. 

A typical AquiferTest might be sketched as follows in Figure 22: 

 

Figure 22: Typical setup of a pumping test. 

9.9.1 Aquifer Test O&M mapping 
Observation and Measurement (O&M 2.0: OGC 10-004r3), along with its GWML 
extensions, contains all the elements needed to model an aquifer test.  Indeed, a complete 
aquifer test can be built around SF_SamplingFeature and OM_Observation, with one 
addition: GW_AquiferTest, a subtype SF_SpatialSamplingFeature (Figure 23), acts to 
distinguish aquifer tests from other sampling features and to package observations and 
sampling features.

9.9.2 GW_AquiferTest  
GW_AquiferTest is a: “Signature class” representing an aquifer test (or pump test). 
GW_AquiferTest properties are inherited from SF_SpatialSamplingFeature and its parent 
classes.   

9.9.3 SF_SamplingFeature properties 

9.9.3.1 sampledFeature  
Links to the real world feature being assessed by the aquifer test (generally a 
GW_AquiferUnit,).  O&M does not constrain SF_SamplingFeature to any particular 
feature type, but this specification requires that the sampledFeature shall be a subtype of 
a GW_HydrogeoUnit. 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/sampledfeature The sampledFeature of a GW_AquiferTest SHALL be 
an instance of a subtype of GW_HydrogeoUnit. 

 

9.9.3.2 relatedSamplingFeature 
The related sampling feature property identifies all the sampling features participating in 
the aquifer test. The role of each feature is assigned by the 
SF_SamplingFeatureComplex:role property. The role of the sampling feature is scoped 
by the test. Therefore, the same sampling feature can have different roles in different 
tests, but also within the same test (by having multiple SF_SamplingFeatureComplex 
referring to the same SF_SamplingFeature). Single bore tests are examples where the

The test feature is the “active” sampling feature where the test is performed (e.g. the well 
that is pumped or injected). 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/testfeature SF_SamplingFeatureComplex:role for the sampling 
feature where the test is performed SHALL have the 
value http://resource.gwml.org/def/role/testFeature 

 

The observation feature is the “passive” feature where observations are made. It is the 
feature at which the effects of the test are measured. 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/observationfeature SF_SampleFeatureComplex:role for the sampling 
feature where the observations are made SHALL have 
the value 
http://resource.gwml.org/def/role/observationFeature 

 

A single sampling feature can be the target of several SF_SamplingFeatureComplex.  A 
data provider can add more than one SF_SamplingFeatureComplex to accommodate 
other roles (see Figure 24). 

 

Figure 24: Multiple roles for the same well using two SF_SamplingFeatureComplexes. 

9.9.3.3 parameter 
Test parameters, such as pumping rates during the test are not considered as being an 
observation, but as test parameters.  To document test parameters, there are two options: 

 Using SF_SpatialSamplingFeature:hostedProcedure of type OM_Process that 
can encode all possible details of a test using SensorML (OGC 12-000), 
MD_Metadata (ISO-19115) or any other suitable model or 

 Use parameter of type SF_SamplingFeature:parameter:NamedValue using 
agreed value types for well-known test parameters.

Altough the formal mechanism to report test parameters is through OM_Process, this 
specification recommends reporting community defined values in simple parameter key-
value pairs (KVP) using sf:NamedValue. 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/testparameter When present 
SF_SamplingFeature:parameter:NamedValue SHALL 
be encoded using community defined values   

9.9.3.4 relatedObservation 
All related observations, including the observations made at the test feature sites and 
observation derived from those observations should be available as related observations 
(sf:relatedObservation).   

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/observation All observations relevant to an aquifer test SHOULD be 
available as relatedObservation 

 

From the raw observations measured during a test, new observations can be inferred or 
calculated.  The raw observations (related from the observation Features) and the derived 
observations (the result of the test) SHALL be related to each other using 
om:ObservationContext.  The role of the observation context defines which observation 
derives or supports the other one. ‘supportObservation’ and ‘derivedObservation’ roles 
can be considered complementary: if A is supportObservation of B, then B is the 
derivedObservation of A. 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/observation-role Raw observations from the observation sampling 
feature SHALL be link to the test result observations 
using the roles defined in Table 1

9.9.3.5 hostedProcedure  
A hostedProcedure is used to document such things as methods to identify or localise the 
sampling feature, but its use is not constrained to anything specific.  The hostedProcedure 
property, of type OM_Process, may be used to accommodate detailed aquifer test 
parameters if needed by the data provider.

The O&M specification does not prescribe any model to encode OM_Process, but 
suggests: 

ISO 19115-2 provides MI_Instrument, LE_Processing and LE_Algorithm, which could 
all be modelled as specializations of OM_Process. OGC SensorML [16] provides a 
model which is suitable for many observation procedures 

OGC 10-0043 / ISO-19156, clause 7.2.3, p. 14 

For instance, a pump (used to pump water from the borehole) can be modelled as a 
SensorML sml:PhysicalSystem. 

9.9.3.6 shape 
SF_SpatialSamplingFeature does not constrain the geometry type (Point, Curve, 
Polygon, etc), therefore any geometry can represent a test.  In most situations, the 
geometry of the test is the test area, the zone of influence around the pumping test or even 
the volume of rock affected or in scope for the test. 

This standard also does not constrain the geometry type.  Communities that wish to 
constrain the geometry type should create a profile of this standard. 

9.9.4 OM_Observation 
OM_Observations are used to represent values of properties observed or computed in the 
context of this test. There are at least two categories of observations generated through an 
aquifer test: 

 Raw observations, normally taken at the observationFeatures, 
 Derived observations, calculated from the raw observations. 

These two kinds of observations differ by their respective feature of interest. For the 
former (raw data) the feature of interest is the sampling feature from which observations 
are made (e.g. observation bore).  In the latter case, the feature of interest is the 
GW_AquiferTest itself.  Observations can be linked together using related observations 
(om:relatedObservation/om:ObservationContext), which provide a role 
(om:ObservationContext/om:role) for the targeted observation.  Figure 25 shows an 
example of “raw” observations (Drawdown1 and Drawdown2) measured at two 
observation wells (obs1 and obs2). The same figure also shows a derived observation 
(transmissivity) having the aquifer test itself as its feature of interest.  The derived 
observation provides a link back to supporting observation used to compute the derived 
values.

Figure 25: Relationships between observations and features of interest. 

Observations made during the test and computed observations are modelled as 
OM_Observations. 

9.9.4.1 phenomenonTime, resultTime and validTime 
As specified in Observation and Measurement; phenomenonTime reflects the time that 
the result applies to the property; the resultTime is the time at which the value has been 
obtained or became available and validTime is the time during which the value is usable.  
Depending on the type of observation (raw or computed), those time might be different 
(see Table 2).

9.9.4.2 observedProperty 
This property describes the phenomenon being observed (e.g., groundwater level).  The 
observed property is normally a reference to a property inherent in the feature of interest 
(“the real word feature is the subject of the observation and carries the observed 
property, OGC-10-004r3, clause 7.2.2.7).   But because of subtle variations in the

semantics of such properties (such as specific Yield versus maximum Yield versus 
sustainable Yield, etc.), the observedProperty meaning should be formally defined by a 
community.  The value of observedProperty becomes a reference to that definition 
(expressed in SWE, SKOS or OWL for example). 

ObservedProperty can also be a compound property (a collection of observedProperty).  
Again, because of the close tie to use cases, compound properties should be defined by a 
community. 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/observedProperty The observedProperty SHOULD be a reference to a 
community managed vocabulary. 

 

9.9.4.3 result  
The result property reports the product of the observation process. In many cases, the 
aquifer test will produce a time series, such as drawdown data over time. When the result 
is a time series, it shall be modelled as a TimeSeriesML 1.0 (OGC 10-042r1). 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/timeseries Observation producing time series SHALL be modelled 
as WaterML 2.0 Time Series (OGC 10-126) 

 

Derived (or computed) observations will often produce compound values. It is possible to 
report each result component as distinct observations, but GWML2 shall use the more 
efficient alternative of wrapping compound results into swe:DataRecord. 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/timeseries-datarecord Derived or computed observations SHALL be encoded 
as swe:DataRecord

10. XML Implementation (normative) 

10.1 GWML2-XSD  
Groundwater features and their properties will be encoded in XML using standard GML 
encoding rules (Annex E of OGC Geography Markup Language v3.2 (ISO 19136:2007).   

In examples, HTTP URIs that are used as resolvable resources (e.g. for vocabularies) are 
encoded using the DTD entity resource.gwml.org to avoid binding the examples to a 
specific URI.  Full instance documents will have an entity declaration in the xml header 
in the form. 

XML snippets will use the following prefixes:

ISO-19136_2007 provides a mapping between UML classifiers and XSD entities.  All 
XSD types and elements must be created following those mapping rules.  This 
specification considers the XSD files (the schema files) to be normative (they contain the 
official interpretation of 19136 conversion of the UML classifiers into XML).   

/req/xsd-xml-rules/W3C_XSD All elements and attributes in a namespace SHALL validate according to 
W3C XSD rules encoded in the xsd file associated with this namespace 
and its dependencies. 

 

Other rules, that can’t be expressed in XSD, are provided as schematron rules.  As the 
XSD files, schematron rules files are considered normative.

Note that this precludes the use of time-coordinate systems such as UNIX time. This is 
specified in order to be maximally consistent with WML2 requirements. The time zone 
will be included in the time element. 

/req/xsd-xml-rules/time-zone The value of each time element SHALL include a time zone definition 
using a signed 4-digit character or a ‘Z’ to represent Zulu or Greenwich 
Mean Time (GMT). This is defined by the following regular expression:

When using the SWE Common types, the following elements SHALL not be 
used: swe:quality (AbstractSimpleComponentType), swe:nilValues 
(AbstractSimpleComponentType), swe:constraint (QuantityType, 
QuantityRangeType, CategoryType). The attributes ‘optional’ and ‘updatable’ 
from the base type ‘AbstractDataComponent’ SHALL also not be used. 

 

10.1.1 Identifier 
A feature that can be accessed through Linked Data using a resolvable HTTP URI must 
use this HTTP URI as its global unique identifier.  In GML, this shall be encoded using 
gml:identifier and code space = “http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616”.  In other words, the 
gml:identifier shall point to a representation of itself.   

/req/xsd-xml-rules/identifier A resolvable resource SHALL expose its resolvable HTTP URI as a 
gml:identifier AND use http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616 for the codeSpace 
value.

10.1.2 By-Reference properties 
Properties can be constrained to be by-reference only, or either inline or by-reference.  
For a by-reference property that refers to an external feature, the reference shall be 
resolvable over the web.  The reference shall be either a resolvable HTTP URI that might 
also match the feature’s globally unique identifier (see /req/gwml2-core/identifier) or an 
HTTP request (for instance, a WFS GetFeature with the stored query 
“urn:ogc:def:query:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById”) to the a representation of the feature in 
GML.   

/req/xsd-xml-rules/byrefproperty A reference to an external feature SHOULD be 
resolvable to a GML representation of the feature

(…) 

Note that elements under GWML2 namespaces can be mixed with other namespaces. For 
example, this specification does not have a dependency to WFS, but GWML can be 
serialised in a WFS document, along with features from other domains.  Failure to 
validate such a document does not necessarily mean that the GWML XML requirements 
are not met, as other external indirect instances might fail.  Therefore, this requirement 
class only addresses instances of GWML in an XML document. 

All property by reference using xlink:href should provide a human readable label in 
xlink:title. 

/req/xsd-xml-rules/xlink-title If an xlink:href is used to reference a controlled vocabulary item, the 
xlink:title attribute SHOULD encode a text label of the referenced item.

Log values are encoded as swe:DataRecord, which is an encoding of ISO 11404 Record.  
It is a composite datatype made of 1 to many fields that are defined along with the 
instance (not by the XSD).  DataRecord allows any collection of fields of any SWE 
AbstractDataComponent.   

The DataRecord definition URI defines the structure of the data record and the semantics 
of the fields.  This specification recommends that the definition be controlled by a 
community with specific use cases to address. 

 

/req/xsd-gwml-well-log/log-
definition 

The definition of a DataRecord and the fields that compose it SHOULD 
have a defining URI governed by an appropriate community  

 

Example of a complete gwWellGeology/GW_GeologyLog for geologic units illustrating 
how swe:DataRecord/definition specifies the field and DataRecord content for the log.

All xml elements under namespace http://www.opengis.net/gwml-aquifertest/2.1 must 
validate with the schema located at http://schemas.opengis.net/gwml/2.1/gwml2-
aquifertest.xsd.   

 

/req/gwml2-aquifer-test/xsd All the elements and types under namespace 
“http://www.opengis.net/gwml-aquifertest/2.1” SHALL validate with schema

XML encoding conforms to O&M XML encoding (10-025r1), sweCommon (08-094r1) 
and WaterML 2.0 encoding (10-126 r4).  This extension introduces a single new class 
with no new property or association. 

Note that, while O&M (OGC 10-004r3) proposes subtypes of (abstract) 
SF_SpatialSamplingFeature, based on their geometries (SF_SamplingPoint, 
SF_SamplingCurve, etc.), the XML encoding does not materialise any classes for these 
sub types, but maps (OGC 10-025r1) them all to a concrete 
SF_SpatialSamplingFeature.  The sub types are “soft types” and reported using 
sam:type property.  This property is an XML encoding artefact from 10-025r1 and is not 
described in the conceptual model (10-004r3).

Annex B: Use-Cases and Implementation Results (informative) 

Five use-cases were developed by the GW2IE to determine GWML2 requirements and to 
test implementation results. While the use-cases describe a variety of actions to be taken, 
this interoperability experiment focusses on delivering the data that would enable such 
actions. XML instance documents referred to in the results can be found at: https://xp-
dev.com/svn/gwml2/Documents/instance/. 

  

1. Commercial Use Case 

Summary The commercial scenario involves serving data to 
allow water wells and springs to be found on a map, 
identified, and related information used to estimate 
the cost to complete a water supply well. For 
example, a consultant or water well driller could use 
a web client to investigate the local geology and 
inspect wells located near the target area. By 
investigating the rock materials and water levels at 
each well in the web client, the consultant could infer 
the distance and materials to the water table, as well 
as the expected yield, and the driller could estimate 
the cost of drilling. The public is also impacted in 
this scenario, as they are able to assess online water 
well records and make independent estimates. This 
not only informs them about drilling potential, but it 
might also influence property purchases. 

Objective: serving water well and aquifer data so it 
can be used for commercial purposes such as to 
inform drilling. 

Users/actors Public, Consultants, Drillers 

Information types  water wells: 
o general: id, source, location, elevation, 

length, water level, well purpose 
o logs: depth interval, lithologies, porosity, 

hydraulic conductivity 
 springs, etc. 
 aquifers: 



OGC 15-082

o general: name, area, 
o geology: formations, lithologies 
o properties: confinement, media, water 

storage, sediment thickness, aquifer 
thickness, porosity, conductivity 

o water balance: aquifer recharge, aquifer 
discharge 

o water use: yield, usage type, quality 
o risk: physical vulnerability, threats 

Actions  A member of the public finds wells near their 
home. 

 A consultant examines the well-logs and aquifer 
info and determines there is groundwater 
potential. 

 A driller uses the well-logs and aquifer info to 
estimate depth to water for price estimate. 

Results 

Seven organizations served primarily Hydrogeological Units and Wells via WFS, 
complemented by some related WMS (see Table 3). The bulk of the core data held by 
the participants was adequately mapped to GWML2 and streamed via the web services, 
thus meeting the basic requirements of this use-case. The source data varied widely in 
terms of the breadth of information available for a feature, particularly for aquifer 
properties and water well construction details. Several issues and proposed solutions are 
noted in Table 4.

2. Policy Use Case 

Summary The Water Framework Directive 20000/60/EC (WFD) requires 
all EU member states to achieve and preserve good status for all 
European waters, including groundwater. The process to achieve 
WFD requirements includes definition and delineation of water 
bodies within management units, environmental monitoring, 
status assessment and finally developing river basin management 
plans.  



OGC 15-082 

155 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
This use case describes the steps and interactions necessary for 
delivering data required to assess groundwater bodies and thus 
meet the related EU reporting obligation. The activity includes: 
collection and evaluation of the geological and hydrogeological 
characteristics, as well as quantitative and qualitative monitoring 
of defined chemical and physical indicators and finally overall 
status assessment of a groundwater body. 
 
Delineation of WFD groundwater bodies, in many cases, is not 
done accordingly to their natural boundaries but usually follows 
administrative units.  
In order to better demonstrate interoperability the use case 
description should cover a cross border scenario, to show 
synchronization of the collected information by two different 
member water authorities. This integrating approach facilitates a 
coordinated assessment and planning of potential future 
measures. 

Objective: The provision of WFD required data and information 
on the trans-boundary groundwater body. 

Users/actors Member state water authorities. 

Information types  WFD River Basin District: 
o general: id, national code, parent river basin districts, 

name and area measurement 
 WFD_Ground Water Body (GWB) 

o general: id (RBC-code), national code, name, 
location, protected area association 

o pressures: pressure types 
o impacts: impact types 
o other impact: further pressure description, other 

impact description 
o trend reversal: reversal trend, free text 
o trend upward: upward trend, free text 
o hydrogeological characteristics: GW layer, area, 

depth, thickness, depth range, geological formation, 
capacity, link surface water, link eco system 

o quantitative status: quantitative status value, 
comment 



OGC 15-082

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

o chemical status (qualitative): chemical status value, 
comment 

o protected area status (optional): protected area code 
(unique), type of protection, Type of association, 
status value. 

Actions  Step 1: Discovering and collecting initial information on 
hydrogeological, geological, chemical and physical data 
about each groundwater body. 

 Step 2: Preprocessing, syntactical and semantically 
transformation of the input information. 

 Step 3: Assessment of required output. 
 Step 4: Delivering of groundwater module for WFD reports. 

Results 

This use-case was scaled back during implementation. The main result is the inclusion of 
GW_ManagementArea in GWML2. The use case was originally designed with a 
European focus on WFD (as above), but was subsequently tested by BoM and GNSS to 
ensure it met more generic groundwater management area requirements (Table 5). In 
general, a management area feature was required in GWML2 because that the spatial 
boundaries of managed areas do not necessarily align exactly with associated 
hydrogeological unit boundaries, as they can be delineated by human factors such as 
policy or regulatory concerns. 

In INSPIRE, managed areas are supported by the ‘Area 
management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units’ theme. Consequently, the 
INSPIRE ‘Geology’ theme, in its ‘Hydrogeology’ package, proposes that 
‘WFDGroundWaterBody‘serve as a hydrogeologically managed area by specializing 
‘ManagementRestrictionOrRegulationZone’. These considerations served as inputs to 
the design of GW_ManagementArea. 

Documentation instituting or enforcing the management area is represented by 
DocumentCitation in the conceptual model, and implemented in the logical model and 
XML schema as Any type, enabling any class such as MD_Metadata, GW_Licence etc., 
to be used. 

Regarding alignment of WFD reporting and GWML2:

 A first action was development of GW_ManagementArea.  
 A second action was to map the pre-INSPIRE data reporting structure onto the 

INSPIRE themes (‘Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting 
units’, ‘Environmental Monitoring Facilities’, …). This was done at the EU level 
(JRC, EEA).  

 A third action is to specialize GW_ManagementArea specifically to support WFD 
reporting. To achieve this, an INSPIRExWFD pilot is being discussed with JRC 
(Table 6).

3. Environmental Use Case 

Summary The role of groundwater in sustaining environmental values 
is of growing importance, particularly in arid countries such 
as Australia. Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) 
include rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries, seeps, springs, 
phreatophytic vegetation, cavernicolous ecology and 
stygofauna. The key parameters are the depth to water 
table, consistency of groundwater levels, groundwater 
fluxes to surface water, groundwater chemistry and 
groundwater biology.  

In many parts of Australia, it is recognized that GDEs are 
vulnerable to the pressures on groundwater resources from 
activities such as mining, agriculture, urban and 
commercial developments. Within the Great Artesian 
Basin, the potential impacts of coal-seam gas extraction on 
groundwater and GDEs is of particular concern.  

An initial attempt at creating a national inventory of GDEs 
has recently been published as an interactive GDE Atlas on 
the Australian Bureau of Meteorology website 
http://www.bom.gov.au/water/groundwater/gde/map.shtml.  

In some states, such as Victoria, proposed changes to 
legislation will provide a risk management framework to 
provide:  

 Protection of high-value GDEs when setting or 
adjusting permissible consumptive volumes,  

 The highest level of protection will be given to GDEs 



OGC 15-082 

159 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

with high environmental values and a high risk of being 
affected by changes in groundwater levels,  

 GDEs with high environmental values that rely on 
regional and intermediate scale groundwater flow 
systems will be considered in groundwater management 
planning, and  

 GDEs with high environmental values that rely on the 
surface expression of local scale groundwater flow 
systems will be assessed on a site-by-site basis in the 
licensing regime.  

Objective: Serving the appropriate groundwater 
information to allow environmental managers, water 
managers and legislators to assess the risks to GDEs. 

User communities/actors Water authorities, government departments, research 
organizations. 

Information types  Groundwater discharge feature: point discharge 
(springs), line discharge (stream baseflow), areal 
discharge (seep, wetland, diffuse, biological) 

o general: id, type, name, location, length, area 
o environmental value: status 

 Groundwater levels (phreatic and potentiometric) 
 Groundwater chemistry: sample ID, date, method, field 

analyses (pH, EC, DO, etc.), laboratory analyses (major 
ions, minor ions, elements, etc.), isotopes, tracers. 

 Groundwater biology: microbiology, stygofauna 

Actions  A water authority assessing a groundwater license 
application finds the nearest GDEs to investigate their 
types and environmental values. 

 A government department assesses the history of 
groundwater fluctuations around a GDE with high 
environmental values. 

 A research organization investigates the groundwater 
heads, gradients and chemistry to determine the 
groundwater capture zone around a GDE at two points 
in time

Results 

Two organizations served a number of components via WFS, complemented by some related 
WMS and SOS (see Table 7). FedUni was able to map the bulk of the required data for this 
use case using core data held in their Visualizing Victoria's Groundwater (VVG) database. 
This included observation (OM_Observation), specimen (SF_Specimen), constituent 
(GW_Constituent), well (GW_Well) and aquifer (GW_Aquifer) data.  The GW_Discharge, 
GW_Recharge and GW_Interflow features were tested using a single case study, since the 
data were not captured in the VVG database.  GNS / UZ was able to map groundwater 
chemistry data from the New Zealand National Groundwater Monitoring Programme 
(NGMP), linked to from the sampling features / monitoring sites of NGMP. While 
OM_Observations are served via a SOS 2.0 implementation, the linkage from the WFS 
Complex Features' related observations to the SOS was envisioned via om:Parameter and 
NamedValue. 

Data was streamed via the web services, thus meeting the basic requirements of this use-case.  
Neither organization was able to complete the mapping for all the required Actions but 
between the two all required components were covered.  Encountered issues are noted in 
Table 8.

4. Scientific Use Case 

Summary This use case involves the delivery of information 
required to help determine the flow of groundwater 
within a particular terrain, likely for input into a 
computational flow modeling software, and model 
results. It involves the delivery of hydrogeologic and 
geophysical properties associated with hydrogeologic 
units (such as key aquifer properties), the delivery of 
observations related to those units, well characteristics 
(driller's log), information about the related water 
bodies and in some cases water use information.

Results 

Two participant organizations successfully mapped well data into GWML2, with a few 
minor exceptions (see Table 9), and served them via WFS. The USGS found that the 
hole size of screen openings could not be fully described, as only one dimension is 
captured in GWML2, whereas the USGS stores two dimensions in order to 
accommodate a variety of hole shapes. Additionally, the specific capacity of a well is 
not accommodated in the model. A solution was suggested to address this issue in Table 
10. Furthermore, the lack of a common lithological vocabulary is a barrier for 
interoperable exchange of well geology information. Efforts to ingest GWML2 well 
data directly into modelling software are ongoing, and preliminary results indicate 
compatibility.

5. Technologic Use Case 

Summary Due to various technical and jurisdictional requirements, it is not possible, 
nor sought, to impose a single physical model on agencies managing 
groundwater related data. Data will instead be likely translated to a 
common standard (GWML2), developed herein, for data exchange. This 
requires a translation between data sources and the standard. 

The objective of this use case is to document mappings between GWML2 
and some pertinent existing models: INSPIRE, GWML1 and 
HY_FEATURES. Though no formalism to represent the mapping has 
been chosen at this point, the main deliverable is documentation, either 
human or machine readable, that could potentially be used in an 
interoperability project. The mapping should be evaluated with regard to 
completeness, complexity, etc.

Actions  Identify a mapping documentation.

Results 

During the scoping and requirements phase of GWML2 development, key elements 
from existing models were identified for potential inclusion in GWML2. This led to a 
consolidated entity list, which contains a list of the entities as well as their definitions. A 
subset of this list was then selected to be the scope for GWML2—thus GWML’s scope 
explicitly includes elements from the other information models. The origin of those 
elements was retained via the entity list, thus providing an informal start to the mappings 
between GWML2 and the other information models. 

Although a complete mapping to three information models was originally intended, i.e. 
to GWML1, INSPIRE Hydrogeology, and HY_FEATURES, the work mainly focused 
on the INSPIRE mapping, with varying progress on the remainder. Mappings were also 
developed between GWML2 and some entities from the Australian NGIS database 
(Table 11).  

The INSPIRE mapping is expressed in a structured Excel spreadsheet, developed over 
several revisions, and is available online at the GW2IE twiki – ModelComparison page. 
See “Comparison_INSPIRE_GWML2” files where CM refers to the GWML2 
Conceptual Model and LM to the GWML2 Logical Model. A drawback to this relatively 
informal mapping is the inability to use it directly in data translation workflows. The 
NGIS mappings are expressed as GWML2 instances whose elements refer to their NGIS

sources.  

The mappings identified equivalences and difference in feature types, their attributes and 
associations. Key differences with the evolving GWML2 often caused modification of 
GWML2, in an iterative approach.  

This mapping exercise raises the question of how to achieve INSPIRE compatibility. 
Other schemas, such as GeoSciML V4, are considering refactoring to ensure that core 
components are compatible with INSPIRE (Table 12). Should GWML2 consider this 
also?

BoM 

for GW_Flow, gwFlowVolumeRate 

is OM_Measurement: that 

constrains the result to be a 

gml:Measurement , so a single 

value with a uom.  We have ranges 

in the database 

Change all 

OM_Measurements 

in the model, to 

OM_Observations 

GWML2 
SWG 

1.2 BoM OM_Observation featureOfInterest 
can be the samplingFeature 

(GW_Well) or the sampledFeature 

(GW_Aquifer). For some observed 

properties (e.g. pH) the former 

doesn’t make sense, so need to be 

able to distinguish the two. See 

discussion below. 

Modify O&M to 

have ultimate 

featureOfInterest 

(0..n) and 

samplingStrategy 

(0..n) for 

intermediate 

sampling features.

(of the aquifer or management 

area): e.g. specific yield, safe yield, 

license yield etc. but  excludes well 

yield.  TBD" The cardinality (0..1)

Change cardinality 

to (0..n), data type.

appear to contradict this. What is 

gwml2:gwAreaYield used for and 

how do we distinguish the various 

yield types? 

2.4 BoM-CSIRO Relationship 
between  <gwml2:gwAreaWaterBu

dget> and <gwml2:gwAreaYield> 

is unclear. Need to be able to 

populate values of 'unallocated 

groundwater' (% and/or ML), 

'current entitlement' (% and/or ML), 

'entitlement limit' (ML).  

Further testing is 

required to ensure 

appropriate 

properties can be 

captured.

The featureOfInterest for the 

observations was mapped to the

Issue 1.2 Discussion: 

The Observations & Measurements specification proposes two patterns for 
featureOfInterest:  
 

(1) the feature of interest can either refer to the real world object that is being 
observed, or  

(2) to a sampling feature (SF_SamplingFeature) that acts as a proxy for the real world 
feature (which is then accessible through the sampling feature’s sampledFeature 
property).    

 
Because the property featureOfInterest has cardinality 1..1, a data provider must choose 
one of these approaches.  Problems occur when a sampling feature is chosen: while many 
observations can refer to the same domain feature, it is impossible to navigate back to the 
sampling feature.  Solutions have been proposed using OM_Process to document the 
relationship between the observation and the sampling feature, but they are cumbersome 
and require much encoding. Consequently, the JSON (OGC 15-100) and RDF encodings 
for O&M include an extra samplingRegime property that is absent from the GML 
encoding.    A change request should be issued to correct this in GML.  In GWML2, there 
is no restriction on featureOfInterest—it can refer to a real world feature or a sampling 
feature.
