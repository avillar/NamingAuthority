vii.  Future Work 

Among the topics for future development are the following items: 

 Allow additional coverage representations (i.e., “multipart” and “special format” cov-
erage encodings) once these are adopted for the GML Application Schema for Cover-
ages [OGC 09-146]. 

 Extend the current 2-D EO Coverage footprint to 3-D footprints by extending them 
with elevation; this will involve extending footprints from bounding multi-curves 
(polygons) to multi-surfaces. 

 Specify usage and content of EOWCS::Lineage in more detail. 

 Align with forthcoming WCS 2.0 extensions once available. 

 Add paging mechanism similar to WFS 2.0.

Introduction 

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) Application Profile – Earth Observation (EO-
WCS), defines a profile of WCS 2.0 [OGC 09-110r4] for use on Earth Observation data. An 
Application Profile bundles several specifications and possibly adds additional requirements 
on an implementation. Extra requirements can be additions (for example, Dataset Series are 
introduced by this specification) or constraints (for example, coverages offered are restricted 
to 2-D rasters).  

EO-WCS provides the following specification elements: 

 Definition of specific Earth Observation coverages (EO Coverages) which have a lat-
itude/longitude or projected x/y spatial extent and a temporal validity extent. EO 
Coverages are derived from Referenceable Grid Coverages and Rectified Grid Cov-
erages as defined in the GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2]. 
Each EO Coverage has an EO metadata set [OGC 10-157r3] contained in its metadata 
which describes the coverage on hand on a higher semantic level.  

 Definition of a hierarchy which allows to group EO Coverages suitably for an effi-
cient retrieval:  

 Datasets as plain 2-D EO Coverages (and, hence, accessible as coverages); 

 Stitched Mosaics as homogeneous collections of spatially non-overlapping sub-
sets of Datasets, accessible themselves as coverages; 

 Dataset Series as collections of Stitched Mosaics, Datasets, and/or Dataset Series; 
Dataset Series themselves are not coverages. 

 Bundling of several mandatory and optional WCS extensions for EO-WCS imple-
mentations.

6 EO data model 

6.1 Overview 

This Clause 6, together with Clauses 7 and 8, establishes the EO-WCS core requirements 
class, eowcs. 

The data model of this EO-WCS centers around the data structure of an Earth Observation 
coverage (EO Coverage), which is a coverage extended with EO Metadata [OGC 10-157r3] 
and bound to a location on the Earth. EO Coverages are a subtype of either GML-
COV::RectifiedGridCoverage or GMLCOV::ReferenceableGridCoverage.  

Based on this EO Coverage concept (cf. Subclause 6.3), three main data elements are de-
fined: 

 A Dataset is a 2-D horizontal EO Coverage, which can represent, for example, a hy-
perspectral satellite scene; cf. Subclause 6.4. A Dataset can be a Rectified Dataset or 
a Referenceable Dataset, depending on the type of EO Coverage it is derived from. 

 A Stitched Mosaic is a collection of 2-D horizontal EO Coverages referring to co-ref-
erenced Datasets; cf. Subclause 6.5. A Stiched Mosaic can be a Rectified Stiched 
Mosaic or a Referenceable Stitched Mosaic, depending on the type of EO Coverage it 



OGC 10-140r1 
 

6 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium  
 

is derived from. A Stitched Mosaic can be interpreted (i.e. requested) as a single cov-
erage. 

 A Dataset Series is a collection of coverages and/or  Dataset Series; cf. Subclause 
6.6. A Dataset Series can refer to any number of Datasets, Stitched Mosaics, and Da-
taset Series. A Dataset Series is not a coverage itself. 

NOTE Annex C provides Use Cases to motivate the definition of these data elements. 

Figure 1 informally symbolizes how the concepts of Dataset, Stitched Mosaic, and Dataset 
Series relate to each other spatio-temporally:  

 A – a Dataset with a particular validity in time; 

 B – a Stitched Mosaic; all its Datasets have a spatial extent contained in the Stitched 
Mosaic’s spatial extent and a timespan contained in the Stitched Mosaic’s time inter-
val. The subsets contributing to the Stitched Mosaic do not overlap in space, but there 
may be empty (nil) areas. 

 C – the overall Dataset Series combining Datasets and Stitched Mosaics. 

 

Figure 1 — Conceptual view of a Dataset Series with Stitched Mosaic and Dataset 

Figure 2 contains the UML diagram defining classes (types) and their correlations in the 
EO-WCS. 

6.2 EO Metadata 

Every EO Coverage contains EO Metadata, consisting of an EarthObservation record as de-
fined in the OGC Earth Observation Metadata Profile of Observations and Measurements 
[OGC 10-157r3] and a lineage describing the history of operations leading to the coverage on 
hand.

Requirement 1 /req/eowcs/eo-metadata-structure: 
A EOWCS::EOMetadata instance shall conform to Table 2, Figure 2, Figure 3, and the 
XML schema being part of this standard.

NOTE Throughout this standard, eop: and EOP:: can be substituted by opt: and OPT:: or 
sar: and SAR::, respectively, as in [OGC 10-157r3] opt and sar are in the substitution group of 
eop. 

 

Figure 3 — UML Lineage class diagram 

NOTE The lineage records are supposed to describe the history of processing steps that has led to 
the coverage on hand. As at the time of this writing there is no canonical format for such histories available 
in OGC, for the purpose of this specification no assumption is made about the contents of a lineage 
record, except that GetCoverage appends its request verbatim as an additional record (see Requirement 46). 

The footprint of an EO Coverage, which contains one or more bounding polygons to describe 
the region of valid data more accurately than the EO Coverage’s bounding box, is mandatory 
as opposed to [OGC 10-157r3]. 

Requirement 2 /req/eowcs/footprint-in-eo-metadata: 
The EOWCS::EOMetadata element of EOWCS::ReferenceableEOCoverage and 
EOWCS::RectifiedEOCoverage instances shall contain an eop:EarthObservat-
ion/om:featureOfInterest/eop:Footprint element. 

NOTE As per [OGC 10-157r3], the footprint is always given in WGS84. 

6.3 EO Coverage 

6.3.1 Overview 

An EO Coverage is a coverage as defined in the GML Application Schema for Coverages 
[OGC 09-146r2]. EO Coverages appear in two variants:  

 Rectified EO Coverages are derived from Rectified Grid Coverage as defined in 
[OGC 09-146r2];  

 Referenceable EO Coverages are derived from Referenceable Grid Coverage as de-
fined in [OGC 09-146r2]. 

Requirement 3 /req/eowcs/eo-coverage-structure: 
EOWCS::ReferenceableEOCoverage and EOWCS::RectifiedEOCoverage in-
stances shall conform to Figure 2, Figure 3, and the XML schema being part of this standard. 

6.3.2 EO Metadata 

An EO Coverage has an EO Metadata record associated. 



OGC 10-140r1 
 

9   Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

Requirement 4 /req/eowcs/eo-metadata-in-eo-coverage: 
EOWCS::ReferenceableEOCoverage and EOWCS::RectifiedEOCoverage in-
stances shall contain one metadata element of type EOWCS::EOMetadata. 

NOTE 1 Besides this specific metadata element there may be further metadata elements. 

NOTE 2 According to the rules of GML, a xlink:href URI to an accessible element of type 
EOWCS::EOMetadata can be provided instead of the element itself in any place of the XML schema 
where such a metadata record appears. 

The EO Metadata record associated with an EO Coverage contains a back reference to the 
coverage. 

Requirement 5 /req/eowcs/eop-identifier-in-eo-metadata: 
The EOWCS::EOMetadata element of EOWCS::ReferenceableEOCoverage and 
EOWCS::RectifiedEOCoverage instances shall contain an element eop:EarthObs-
ervation/eop:metadataProperty/eop:EarthObservationMeta-
Data/eop:identifier whose first word (NCNAME type substring i.e. starting from it's 
first character up to and excluding the first character which is not allowed in an NCName) is 
identical to the EO Coverage identifier. 

NOTE Normally, this word (i.e. NCName) acting as coverage identifier will be the only contents of 
the eop:identifier string and thus both elements will be equal. 

6.3.3 Spatio-temporal extent 

The EO Coverage’s extent of valid data is given by its EO Metadata footprint, which refines 
the coverage’s envelope. 

Requirement 6 /req/eowcs/footprint-inside-boundedBy: 
In EOWCS::ReferenceableEOCoverage and EOWCS::RectifiedEOCoverage 
instances, all polygons listed in eop:EarthObservation/om:featureOfInter-
est/eop:Footprint element shall be geometrically contained in the bounding box of 
the gml:boundedBy element of the gml:Envelope.

7 EO service model 

7.1 Overview 

This Clause defines request types and their responses for operations on EO Coverages. EO 
Coverages can be offered by a WCS server alongside with any other type of coverages. Be-
havior of the service on non-EO Coverages remains unchanged. 

7.2 GetCapabilities operation 

7.2.1 GetCapabilities request 

The GetCapabilities request is extended over WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4] as follows: 

 In the sections request parameter, values “DatasetSeriesSummary“ and “Cover-
ageSummary” are allowed in addition to those defined in OWS Common [06-121r9]. 



OGC 10-140r1

Requirement 29 /req/eowcs/getCapabilities-request-sections: 
If a GetCapabilities request contains an ows:Sections element then this element shall con-
tain ows:Section elements with the values defined in OWS Common, or “Dataset-
SeriesSummary”, or “CoverageSummary”. 
Dependency: [OGC 06-121r9] clause 7.3.3 

7.2.2 GetCapabilities response 

The GetCapabilities response is extended over WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4] as follows: 

 There is an additional DatasetSeriesSummary section reporting identifiers of 
Dataset Series offered by the service on hand. 

 There is an optional constraint CountDefault specifiying the maximum number of 
CoverageDescription and DatasetSeriesDescription elements reported 
in a DescribeEOCoverageSet response. 

NOTE An EO-WCS server may choose to not report, in the CoverageSummary section of a 
GetCapabilities response, the identifiers of Stitched Mosaic coverages referred to by some Dataset Series 
and the identifiers of Dataset coverages referred to by some Stitched Mosaic or Dataset Series. 

In a GetCapabilities response, a server announces availability of this EO-WCS like an exten-
sion. 

Requirement 30 /req/eowcs/getCapabilities-response-conformance-class-in-profile: 
A WCS service implementing this extension shall include the following URI in a Profile 
element in the ServiceIdentification in a GetCapabilities response: 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_application-profile_earth-
observation/1.0/conf/eowcs 

Requirement 31 /req/eowcs/getCapabilities-response-structure: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall consist of a data structure as de-
fined in Figure 7, Table 7, and the XML Schema being part of this standard.

7.4 GetCoverage operation 

7.4.1 GetCoverage request 

The GetCoverage request is unchanged over WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4], except that for EO 
Coverages slicing is disallowed as it would leave the EO Metadata undefined. 

NOTE A GetCoverage request is possible on the identifiers of EO Coverages offered by the server 
even if these are not listed in a GetCapabilities response. 

Requirement 41 /req/eowcs/getCoverage-request-no-slicing: 
A GetCoverage request on EO Coverages shall not contain a slicing operation.

7.4.2 GetCoverage response 

The GetCoverage response is as defined in the WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4], however extend-
ed in two respects: 

 The coverage returned contains exactly one metadata element holding the EO 
Metadata record (it may contain further metadata elements in addition); 

 The lineage component of the EO Metadata record returned consists of the pre-
existing lineage sequence plus one element appended which describes the GetCover-
age request on hand. 

NOTE As always, whether all these elements will be available to a client depends on the degree of 
support for the information items by the requested coverage encoding. 

On EO Coverages, a GetCoverage request shall produce a coverage of the type correspond-
ing to the coverage inspected. 

Requirement 42 /req/eowcs/getCoverage-response-coverage-type: 
The response to a successful GetCoverage request 
- on a Rectified Stitched Mosaic shall be of type RectifiedStitchedMosaic, 
- on a Rectified Dataset shall be of type RectifiedDataset, 
- on a Referenceable Stitched Mosaic shall be of type ReferenceableStitchedMosaic, and 
- on a Referenceable Dataset shall be of type ReferenceableDataset,. 

The EO Metadata, including the extended lineage record, shall be delivered alongside with 
the coverage data, adjusted according to the operations executed during GetCoverage evalua-
tion. 

Requirement 43 /req/eowcs/getCoverage-response-eo-metadata: 
In the response to a successful GetCoverage request on an EO Coverage, the EOWCS::EO-
Metadata of the coverage returned shall contain the complete EOWCS::EOMetadata of 
the coverage addressed, adjusted as specified in Requirement 44, Requirement 45, and Re-
quirement 46. 

Requirement 44 /req/eowcs/getCoverage-response-eo-metadata-in-stitched-mosaic: 
In the response to a successful GetCoverage request on a Stitched Mosaic, the EOWCS::EO-
Metadata of the coverage returned shall contain the original Stitched Mosaic’s references 
to those Datasets which have a non-empty intersection with the effective spatio-temporal 
request trim interval, and no other ones. 

Requirement 45 /req/eowcs/getCoverage-response-footprint-in-eo-metadata: 
If, in a successful GetCoverage request on an EO Coverage, trimming along spatial coordi-
nates is specified then the footprint of the EOWCS::EOMetadata in the coverage returned 
shall be given by the intersection of the spatial request interval and the footprint of the cover-
age requested. Otherwise, the footprint in the result coverage shall be given by the footprint 
of the coverage requested. 

The lineage record shall be extended by a reproducible description of the GetCoverage re-
quest originating this output.

Requirement 46 /req/eowcs/getCoverage-response-lineage-in-eo-metadata: 
In the response to a successful GetCoverage request, the Lineage component shall consist of 
the Lineage component of the coverage requested with one record appended containing the 
complete, verbatim GetCoverage request leading to this response. 

NOTE This content is dependent on the protocol used by the requestor. In case of a GET/KVP request, 
this will be the request URL with parameters. In case of an XML or SOAP request this will be an XML 
snippet.

7.5 DescribeEOCoverageSet operation 

7.5.1 Overview 

A DescribeEOCoverageSet request submits one or more Dataset Series, Stitched Mosaic, or 
Dataset identifiers together with a spatio-temporal subsetting criterion (“bounding box”). The 
spatial constraint is expressed in WGS84 [4], the temporal constraint in ISO 8601 [2].  

The response to a successful request on a Dataset Series consists of a (possibly empty) set of 
descriptions of Datasets and Stitched Mosaics and a (possibly empty) set of descriptions of 
Dataset Series. The response to a successful request on a Stitched Mosaic consists of a (pos-
sibly empty) set of descriptions of Datasets. In any case, the result items are those ones which 
are (i) referred to directly or via Dataset Series by the object submitted and (ii) matched by 
the bounding box. The type of matching – contains or overlaps – is specified in the 
request.

7.5.2 DescribeEOCoverageSet request 

Requirement 47 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-structure: 
A DescribeEOCoverageSet request shall consist of a structure as defined in Figure 8, Table 
10 and the XML schema being part of this standard. 

The DescribeEOCoverageSet request type contains two sections (cf. [OGC 06-121r9] Clause 
7.3.3) whose appearance in the response can be controlled by the client through the optional 
sections parameter. 

Requirement 48 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-sections: 
If a DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains an ows:Sections element then this element 
shall contain one of the values “CoverageDescriptions”, “DatasetSeriesDescriptions”, or 
“All”. 
Dependency: [OGC 06-121r9] clause 7.3.3 

NOTE This use of the sections parameters is similar to its use in GetCapabilities as defined in OWS 
Common [OGC 06-121r9]. 

NOTE Future versions of the EO-WCS are likely to use the DimensionTrim element defined in the 
forthcoming Predefined CRSs Extension instead of WCS::DimensionTrim. 

Requirement 49 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-eoId: 
Each eoId parameter value in a DescribeEOCoverageSet request shall be equal to the iden-
tifier of a Dataset, a Stitched Mosaic, or a Dataset Series offered by the server addressed. 

NOTE A DescribeEOCoverageSet request is possible on the identifiers of objects offered by the server 
even if these are not listed in a GetCapabilities response. 

Requirement 50 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-containment: 
If a DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains a containment parameter then this parame-
ter shall have one of the values “contains” or “overlaps”. 

Requirement 51 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-dimensions: 
If a DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains dimensionTrim elements with dimen-
sion parameters then each such dimension parameter shall have one of the values “lat”, 
“long”, or “phenomenonTime”, Each of these values shall appear at most once in a given 
request. 

Requirement 52 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-crs: 
A DescribeEOCoverageSet request shall use WGS84 [4] as spatial and ISO 8601 [2] as tem-
poral CRS for the coordinates in trim requests. 

NOTE Trim coordinates are not required to lie within the boundaries of the EO Coverage inquired.

7.5.3 DescribeEOCoverageSet response 

The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request consists of a (possibly empty) 
set of EO Coverage descriptions and a (possibly empty) set of Dataset Series descriptions (cf. 
Figure 9).  

Requirement 53 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-structure: 
The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request shall consist of a 
EOWCS::EOCoverageSetDescription structure as defined in Table 11, Figure 9 and

Figure 9 — DescribeEOCoverageSet response UML diagram 

Requirement 54 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-eo-metadata: 
Each WCS::CoverageDescription listed in the response to a successful De-
scribeEOCoverageSet request shall contain one EOWCS::EOMetadata element containing 
the EO Metadata component of the EO Coverage to be described. 

The response shall respect the sections request parameter. 

Requirement 55 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-section-
coverageDescriptions: 
If a DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains a sections parameter then a successful re-
sponse shall contain a wcs:CoverageDescriptions element if and only if the section 
parameter list contains one of the values “CoverageDescriptions” or “All”. 

Requirement 56 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-section-
datasetSeriesDescriptions: 
If a DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains a sections parameter then a successful re-
sponse shall contain a eowcs:DatasetSeriesDescriptions element if and only if the 
section parameter list contains one of the values “DatasetSeriesDescriptions” or “All”. 

Such a response contains only EO Coverages directly referred to by the object(s) addressed in 
the request or via referred Dataset Series. 

Requirement 57 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-eoId: 
In the response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request containing a wcs:Cover-
ageDescription section, each EO Coverage referred to by one of the objects identified in 
the eoId request parameter shall appear at most once. 

Requirement 58 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-referred: 
The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request containing a wcs:Cover-



OGC 10-140r1 
 

29   Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

ageDescription section shall contain the descriptions of exactly those EO Coverages 
referred to directly or indirectly via Dataset Series by one of the objects identified in the 
eoId request parameter, without any duplicates. 

NOTE A Dataset referred to by a Dataset Series referred to by another Dataset Series is implicitly re-
ferred to by the later Dataset Series and thus always reported by a DescribeEOCoverageSet request against 
the later Dataset Series. However, it is allowed that such a Dataset is also referred to by the first Dataset 
Series but it is only reported once. 

NOTE A Dataset referred to by a Stitched Mosaic referred to by a Dataset Series is not per se referred to 
by that Dataset Series and thus not reported by a DescribeEOCoverageSet request against the Dataset Se-
ries. However, it is allowed that such a Dataset is also referred to by the enclosing Dataset Series. 

Spatial subsetting is evaluated against the eop:Footprint element contained in the 
EOMetadata element of an EO Coverage. 

Requirement 59 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-containment: 
The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request containing a wcs:Cover-
ageDescription section shall contain only descriptions of those EO Coverages whose 
spatial footprint defined by its eop:EarthObservation/om:featureOfInter-
est/eop:Footprint 
- overlaps with the spatial request extent, and the request parameter containment is of 
value overlaps or is omitted, 
- is completely contained within the spatial request extent, and the request parameter con-
tainment is of value contains 
whereby all spatial coordinates are expressed in WGS84 [2]. 

Temporal subsetting is evaluated against the temporal validity of an EO Coverage. 

Requirement 60 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-phenomenonTime: 
The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request containing a wcs:Cover-
ageDescription section shall contain only descriptions of EO Coverages whose time 
interval defined by its eop:EarthObservation/om:phenomenon-
Time/gml:TimePeriod/gml:beginPosition and eop:EarthObservation/-
om:phenomenonTime/gml:TimePeriod/gml:endPosition elements in 
eowcs:EOMetadata   
- overlaps with the request time extent,and the request parameter containment is of value 
overlaps or is omitted, 
- is completely contained within the request time extent, and the request parameter con-
tainment is of value contains, 
whereby all temporal coordinates are expressed in ISO 8601 [2]. 

Boundary values omitted are substituted by the actual boundary value of the object inquired. 

Requirement 61 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-trim-omitted: 
In a DescribeEOCoverageSet request, a trim specification omitted shall be interpreted as the 
actual boundary of the objects requested in the axis omitted. 



OGC 10-140r1 
 

30 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium  
 

Requirement 62 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-bound-omitted: 
In a DescribeEOCoverageSet request, a lower or upper bound omitted shall be interpreted as 
indicating the actual lower or upper bound of the objects requested in the axis omitted. 

NOTE This trim semantics is analogous to trimming in GetCoverage. 

Requirement 63 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-coverageSubtype: 
In the response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request, each EO Coverage listed 
shall contain in its WCS::CoverageSubtype element the corresponding value given in 
Table 8 according to its type. 

Requirement 64 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-count: 
In the response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request the sum of CoverageDe-
scription and DatasetSeriesDescription elements shall be less or equal to the 
minimum of the value of the CountDefault element and the count parameter if present in 
the request. If none of both are present all matching elements shall be reported. 

Requirement 65 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-numberMatched: 
The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request shall report in its number-
Matched attribute the sum of all matching CoverageDescription and Dataset-
SeriesDescription elements. 

Requirement 66 /req/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-response-numberReturned: 
The response to a successful DescribeEOCoverageSet request shall report in its number-
Returned attribute the sum of all CoverageDescription and DatasetSeriesDe-
scription elements included in the response.

8 WCS extensions 

8.1 Overview 

Requirements class eowcs normatively depends on the WCS Extension specifications listed 
in this Clause. In other words, any implementation claiming to conform to this requirements 
class must also implement the specifications required in this Clause. 

8.2 Band subsetting

 SubsetSpec:  dimension ( interval ) 
 dimension:  long | lat | phenomenonTime 
 interval:  low , high 
 low:    point | * 
 high:   point | * 
 point:   number | " token "  // " = ASCII 0x42 

Syntax follow the http standard [3]: underlined tokens represent literals which appear “as is” 
(“terminal symbols”), other tokens represent sub-expressions to be substituted (“non-termin-
als”). A vertical bar (“|”) denotes alternatives, items in brackets (“[ ]”) are optional. Non-
terminals NCName, number, token, and anyURI follow the resp. XML definitions [6]. 

NOTE 1 Allowed values for points are determined by the CRS used. This ranges from “2009-11-06” for 
time to “-41.5” and ”41°5’ ” for lat/long whereby non-numeric values have to be enclosed in double quotes. 

NOTE 2 CRSs are fixed to WGS84 for space and ISO 8601 for time; still they need to be indicated in 
the request syntax to keep it in sync with WCS Core trimming. 

NOTE 3 As per http [3], keys are case insensitive whereas values are case sensitive. 

Example The following KVP-encoded DescribeEOCoverageSet request addresses service path on 
server www.myservice.org at port port requests coverage C0002 in the domain specified by the 
bounding box with longitude (-71,47) and latitude (-66,51), expressed in spatial CRS WGS84-2D and temp-
oral CRS ISO:8601 (which are assumed to be supported for the coverage):

Transitional provisions 

Clause 2 of this specification normatively references specifications under development and, 
hence, not yet available. For each such specification, therefore, WCS 1.1 Corrigendum 2 
[OGC 07-065r7] shall apply until the respective specification gets adopted as an official 
OGC document.  

NOTE    This requirement is not subject to conformance testing as WCS 1.1 does not follow OGC's 
core/extension paradigm.

Annex C 
(informative) 

 
Use Case examples 

In the following two Use Cases are presented to illustrate possible application scenarios of 
EO-WCS in the domain of earth observation and remote sensing. 

C.1 Use Case 1 

Provider offers, through an EO-WCS service, one Dataset Series containing Sea Surface 
Temperature (SST) and another Dataset Series containg Ocean Color (OC).  

User wants to compare the timely development and distribution of some algal bloom in rela-
tionship to ocean currents indicated by the changes in SST. User, therefore, plans to analyze a 
timeseries of OC and SST imageries over a certain period of time (TOI) in the Area of Inter-
erst (AOI).  

User first addresses the EO-WCS service by issuing a GetCapabilities request.The resulting 
response contains information about available DatasetSeriesIds, their spatial extent (as 
WGS84BoundingBox), as well as their temporal validity (as beginPosition and end-
Position).  

Based on this information, User can issue a DescribeEOCoverageSet request, using the re-
ceived DatasetSerieId (as eoId) to obtain detail information on the content of the two 
offered DatasetSeries of interest. Since User is only interested in a limited period of time and 
a certain area, the DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains parameters for spatial and tem-
porat subsetting, for example: 

subset=lat(32,47)& 
subset=long(11,33)& 
subset=phenomenonTime("2006-08-01","2006-08-22T19:22:00Z") 

User will receive a response containing the CoverageIds of the datasets available within 
this spatio-temporal bounding box provided; notably, this set will be empty if no item is con-
tained within the area and time queried.  

User subsequently decides about which of the coverages identified are of interest and issues a 
GetCoverage request for each CoverageId received in the DescribeEOCoverageSet re-
sponse. Again, User can select an AOI (via the subset parameter); additionally, specific bands 
(via range subsetting), output coverage format, output CRS, interpolation method, etc. can be 
selected depending on the WCS extensions implemented by the server; the Capabilities doc-
ument contains pertinent information. 

Following download via GetCoverage, the SST and OC coverages can be analyzed and pro-
cessed on User's local workstation. 



OGC 10-140r1 
 

70 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium  
 

C.2 Use Case 2 

Provider offers, during harvesting seasons (e.g., March through August), three 2-monthly 
Stitched Mosaics for a certain area. Whenever new images are available in this area they are 
included in the respective (time-slot) Stitched Mosaic, possibly replacing older datasets or 
parts thereof. The providers applies a "least cloud cover/newest on top" approach to feed into 
the respective mosaics. At the end of each 2-month period the next mosaic is initiated. Stitch-
ed Mosaics enable Provider to offer the full metadata set for each dataset participating in a 
mosaic for any time instance, down to pixel-level accuracy. 

User wants to assess crop yield for an AOI contained within the providers Stitched Mosaics. 
For doing so, User needs data about the same AOI for at least 2 points in time. Further, User 
requires the full metadata recorded (including possible lineage data) together with the actual 
imagery.  

User addresses the EO-WCS by issuing a GetCapabilities request.The response contains the 
coverageIds for all Stitched Mosaics available. 

Futher information – i.e., metadata – can be obtained through a DescribeCoverage request on 
the coverageIds received. This yields bounding box, footprint, bands, as well as timestamp 
information (e.g., oldest and youngest image) of the datasets participating in the Stitched 
Mosaic. Alternatively, if User needs details about those datasets comprising a particular 
Stitched Mosaic, a DescribeEOCoverageSet request using the CoverageId as eoId can be 
issued. This results in detailed information (time, footprint, bands, etc.) about each dataset 
participating in the object queried.  

For accessing the image data, User issues a GetCoverage request providing the identifier of 
the object to be retrieved. In addition to the mandatory request parameters, further optional 
parameters allow specifying output format, geographic subset, and further details; availability 
of this functionality depends on the extensions the EO-WCS implements, as indicated in its 
Capabilities document. The coverages retrieved finally can be analyzed and processed further 
in User's local workstation environment.
