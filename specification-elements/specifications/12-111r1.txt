i. Abstract 
This document proposes a set of best practices and guidelines for implementing and using the Open 
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Map Service (WMS) to serve maps which are time-dependent or 
elevation-dependent. In particular, clarifications and restrictions on the use of WMS are defined to 
allow unambiguous and safe interoperability between clients and servers, in the context of expert 
meteorological and oceanographic usage and non-expert usage in other communities. This Best 
Practice document applies specifically to WMS version 1.3, but many of the concepts and 
recommendations will be applicable to other versions of WMS or to other OGC services, such as the 
Web Coverage Service. 

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues: 

meteorology oceanography time elevation 'time-dependent' 'elevation-dependent' wms 'web map 
service' 1.3 1.3.0 ogc 'best practice' ogcdoc 

iii. Preface 
This Best Practice document is the result of discussions within the Meteorology and Oceanography 
Domain Working Group (MetOcean DWG) of the Technical Committee (TC) of the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) regarding the use of the OGC Web Map Service (WMS) to provide map 
visualizations from the various types of data regularly produced, analyzed, and shared by those 
communities. The discussion considered the differences in the types of data as well as the issues, 
concerns, and responsibilities of data producers when sharing those data as maps with end users, 
including analysts within the meteorological and oceanographic communities, users with specific needs 
and the general public. The limited scope of the requirements and recommendations in this document 
reflects the consensus reached by groups with vastly different types of data, limitations in the current 
design of the WMS specification, compromises to ensure these services remain applicable to a mass 
market audience, and a wish to release a first version of document without undue delay. Future work 
includes extending this Best Practice once the community gains more experience with WMS and with 
implementing the provisions of this document. This document does not require any changes to other 
OGC standards but it is hoped that the WMS specification will evolve to address issues encountered in 
this work such as providing a mechanism to define exclusive dimensions and to define sparse 
combinations of dimensions. 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of 
patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all 
such patent rights. 

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant 
patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed 
by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting 
documentation when possible.

1. Introduction 

The meteorological and oceanographic communities have been exchanging information internationally 
for at least 150 years and well understand the importance of geospatial standards for interoperability. 
These standards have typically defined data formats, interfaces, processes, shared conceptual models, 
and sustainable maintenance processes. 

Because of the demanding nature of meteorological and oceanographic data processing, the 
communities have evolved domain specific solutions. However, as computers have become more 
powerful, it has become feasible to use general geospatial software for day-to-day operational 
purposes, and interoperability problems have arisen. There has also been an increasing need to combine 
meteorological and oceanographic data with other forms of geospatial data from other domains, in 
ways convenient for those domains. 

Meteorological and oceanographic data are inherently multidimensional in time and space. Annex A 
provides a formalized description of some of the issues for these temporal and spatial dependencies for 
the context of Web Map Services (WMS). Serving these data through WMS can be done with a variety 
of implementation choices or interpretations. 

This document describes and justifies a set of best practices for offering and requesting meteorological 
and oceanographic data with temporal or elevation dependencies through WMS. This set of best 
practices is intended to meet the interoperability requirements of the meteorological and oceanographic 
communities and enable them and their customers to gain the economic benefits of using commercial 
off the shelf (COTS) software implementations of WMS servers and clients. 

1.1 Time 
Complex geospatial data such as that in common use by the meteorological and oceanographic 
communities may be temporally independent or may have one or more temporal dependencies that may 
express the relation of the data to different time references such as applicable time, collection time or 
other significant times. The WMS specification permits such data to be offered through a WMS in 
many different ways including many different WMS layers with or without a temporal dimension, or as 
a single WMS layer with many temporal dimensions. This document makes recommendations to 
promote interoperability by focusing on the most common temporal dependencies in the domain, by 
developing a consistent terminology for such data, and by defining an approach to structuring such data 
for distribution as layers in a WMS. 

The WMS specification provides for definition of a time value, a single timestamp, a time interval, or a 
list of timestamps and time intervals. A timestamp t is a sequence <c1,…,cn>, 1 ≤ n ≤7, of time 
components, where the components are defined as follows: 

 c1 stands for a year. A value is between 1 and 9999. Negative values or more than 4 characters 
are also allowed by WMS1.3, Annex D and ISO8601. 

 c2 stands for a month. A value is between 1 and 12. 

 c3 stands for a day. A value is between 1 and 31. 

 c4 stands for an hour. A value is between 0 and 23. 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   6/41 

 c5 stands for a minute. A value is between 0 and 59. 

 c6 stands for a second. A value is usually between 0 and 59 and rarely 60 for leap seconds. 

 c7 stands for a millisecond. A value is between 0 and 999. 
The precision of a timestamp t is determined by the last time component of t. Timestamps may be 
associated with a time zone. If no time zone is specified with a timestamp t, then t is assumed to be in 
local time. If a timestamp t should be considered as a time in UTC, then the character Z has to be added 
to the string representation of t. The string representation of a timestamp is built from the time 
components and specific separators. A full string representation has the following format: 

“YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSZ” 

where: 

YYYY indicates a 4-digit year 
MM indicates a month 
DD indicates a day of a month 
T is the separator between the date part and the time part 
hh indicates an hour 
mm indicates a minute 
ss indicates a second 
SSS indicates a millisecond 
Z is the time zone designator for the zero UTC offset 

Timestamps are comparable. A timestamp t1 is before a time stamp t2 if and only if the string 
representation of t1 is lexicographically less than the string representation of t2. A timestamp t1 is after a 
time stamp t2 if and only if the string representation of t1 is lexicographically greater than the string 
representation of t2. Two timestamps are equal if and only if their string representations are equal. 

This definition of comparison ensures that two timestamps of different precision are different. Consider 
for example the timestamps t1 = 2013-01-22 and t2 = 2013-01-22T00:00:00Z. t1 has a day precision and 
t2 is exact to a second. t1 is before t2. They are not equal. 

A time interval is a triple tmin/tmax/r where tmin and tmax are timestamps that define the lower and upper 
bounds of the interval and r is the resolution. The interval contains all timestamps tmin + i * r, i >= 0, 
that are lower or equal than tmax. 

A resolution r is represented by the format P [n1Y] [n2M] [n3D] [T [n4H] [n5M] [n6S]] where 

P is a starting character. 
Y is the year designator that follows the value n1 for the number of years. 
M is the month designator that follows the value n2 for the number of months. 
D is the day designator that follows the value n3 for the number of days. 
T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation. 
H is the hour designator that follows the value n4 for the number of hours. 
M is the minute designator that follows the value n5 for the number of minutes. 
S is the second designator that follows the value n6 for the number of seconds. 



 

  7/41 

A time interval with a resolution value of zero means that the interval has an infinitely-fine resolution. 
It contains all possible timestamps between the lower and the upper bound of the interval. In this case 
the resolution part can be omitted and the interval should be written as a pair tmin/tmax. 

Data that have no temporal dependency can be offered as single WMS layers without any associated 
temporal dimension. For example, topographic data or data for the climatological normal1 may be 
offered as WMS layers without any WMS dimensions, implicitly making the assumption that any 
temporal dependency is irrelevant over the time scale under consideration. 

Data that have a single temporal association also can be treated simply being offered as single WMS 
layers with a single temporal dimension. For example, satellite imagery taken from the same platform 
for the same spatial extent at different moments in time can be offered as a single WMS layer with a 
single temporal dimension. Here, the temporal dimension represents a time used to identify individual 
satellite products (conventionally it is usually the beginning or the end of the scan). 

Data that have multiple temporal associations, such as numerical weather forecasts, series of alerts, or 
data associated with trajectories of moving objects, do not have a single obvious representation as 
WMS layers. The WMS standard only defines a single temporal dimension called time. Each user 
community has the flexibility of defining the use of that dimension, the possibility of defining other 
temporal dimensions for structuring this multi-temporal data, and the work of structuring common 
metadata using those temporal axes. This may result in splitting such data into many layers, each 
representing different temporal associations, or using several temporal dimensions to reduce the 
number of WMS layers. 

Numerical weather forecast calculations present an example of data with multiple temporal 
associations. Numerical weather forecasts, for example, may have three separate calculations for air 
temperature, each containing 48 forecasts at successive 1 hour intervals. In such a case, the available 
combinations of validity time and calculation nominal start time are as shown in the table below. 
Columns sharing an “*” across rows indicate forecasts from different calculations (i.e., nominal start 
times) that share the same validity time.

three consecutive 10 year periods.

Table 1: Example of two dimensional time axis for numerical model forecast data 

The forecasts associated with these three calculations might be represented in a WMS as 144 separate 
layers (with or without an associated time dimension) or as a single layer with two time dimensions. 
The former approach will result in a larger, more complex capabilities document; the latter approach 
will permit the valid combinations of nominal start time and validity time to be expressed more 
compactly as a single layer. 

Warnings and alerts are common categories of meteorological data that often have multiple temporal 
associations. A meteorological warning is a message about a meteorological event that will probably 
occur in the future at a geographic location. Typically, a warning becomes effective when it has been 
sent out. But, it will be also possible to specify an effective time explicitly. The validity period of a 
warning is the period between the expected beginning of the event in the warning and its expiry. 

For example, the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) Version 1.2, which is an OASIS standard format 
for exchanging all-hazard emergency alerts and public warnings, defines four time attributes for 
warnings and alerts. These are detailed in the following table. 

Element name Definition Optionality Notes 

sent The time and date of the 
origination of the warning 

required  

effective The effective time of the 
information of the warning 

optional If the effective time is not explicitly defined, then 
this time shall be assumed to be the same as the 
sent time. 

onset The expected time of the 
beginning of the subject 
event of the warning 

optional  

expires The expiry time of the 
information of the warning 

optional If this value is not provided, each recipient is free 
to set its own policy as to when the warning is no 
longer in effect. 

Table 2: Time related attributes in CAP Version 1.2 



 

  9/41 

According to these definitions, the validity period of a warning is the period between the onset time and 
the expiry time, if the onset time is given. Otherwise, it is the period between the effective time and the 
expiry time. 

A warning is valid at a particular time if it has not expired at that moment. A warning situation is a set 
of valid warnings at a particular time. A warning situation changes if a new warning is sent out or if an 
existing valid warning is withdrawn or modified. Typical modifications are the adjustment of the 
validity period or the change of the severity level. Figure 1 shows a warning situation on 12th August 
2012 at 13:00 UTC drawn as a blue line. The diagram contains five warnings. But only three of them 
are part of the warning situation at the time under consideration because the first two are or will be 
expired. 

 
Figure 1: Example of a warning situation 

The WMS specification provides the flexibility of representing the warning shown in Figure 1 in a 
WMS as five separate layers (with or without a time dimension) or as a single layer with two time 
dimensions (e.g., effective time and validity period). 

Trajectory data present a third example of meteorological data that often have multiple temporal 
associations. A trajectory is the path that a moving object follows through space as a function of time. 

Trajectories can run forward or backward. Good examples of forward trajectories are trajectories for 
volcanic ash. They are usually calculated using the data of a numerical weather forecast calculation. 
Such a forward trajectory predicts the movement of air masses from a given geographical position, the 
location of the volcano. In this case, the trajectory has the same temporal associations as the numerical 
weather forecast because it is based on these data. For example, if the data of the forecast calculation 
contain 48 forecasts at successive 1 hour intervals, then the trajectory can have up to 48 validity times.

Figure 2: Forward trajectories from the volcano Katla 

Consider Figure 2. It shows three forward trajectories for the forecast movement of volcanic ash 
released into the upper troposphere at the geographical position of the volcano Katla in Iceland. The 
trajectories are calculated by Deutscher Wetterdienst’s global numerical weather prediction model. The 
model output used in this example dates from 2013-05-16T00:00:00Z and includes forecasts for seven 
days. Each trajectory belongs to a different height regime (pink = lower, yellow = middle, sea green = 
higher). The temporal resolution is about 6 hours. 

Figure 3 shows another example of trajectory data with multiple temporal associations, but for a 
hypothetical scenario. The trajectories are calculated for a simulated hydrocarbon leak in the English 
Channel at the black dot locating the source of the pollution beginning January 15th at 12:00 UTC. The 
marine pollution model of Météo-France is used for the calculation. The Figure represents the forecast 
pollution of the model’s calculations on April 23rd forecast for April 26th at 12:00 UTC, combining the 
result of simulations made every 30 minutes over a temporal period of 2460 hours from January 15th.

1.2 Elevation 
Complex geospatial data such as that in common use by the meteorological and oceanographic 
communities may be independent of elevation or may have one or more vertical dependencies. 

The WMS specification permits such data to be offered through a WMS in different ways: as many 
layers with or without a vertical dimension, or as a single layer with many vertical dimensions. 
Elevations can also be specified using multiple measure types including nominal values such as 'earth 
surface’ 'tropopause,' or 'cloud top’, or numeric values specifying the distance above or below some 
vertical datum. Furthermore, data may have multiple vertical dependencies that are mutually exclusive; 
unfortunately the WMS standard does not specify any mechanism to declare two dimensions on a given 
layer but make them mutually exclusive to prevent clients asking for values in both dimensions at once. 
This document makes recommendations to promote interoperability by focusing on the most common 
elevation dependencies in the domain, by developing a consistent terminology for such data, and by 
defining an approach to structuring such data for distribution as layers in a WMS. 

The following examples taken from the meteorological and oceanographic community illustrate 
different types of elevation-dependent data: 

 A data set recording total cloud cover or bathymetry values may have no elevation dependency 

  A data set recording air temperature at a given numeric height has an elevation dependency that 
can be specified by using a numeric value for the elevation and associating that value to a 
vertical coordinate reference system (CRS) specifying the vertical datum anchoring the height 
value 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   12/41 

 A data set recording an environmental parameter on a computed surface, such as the 
tropopause, an isotherm, the base (or top) of contrail, a surface of constant potential vorticity, or 
a jet level, has an elevation dependency that can be specified using a nominal value identifying 
the surface. In general, it is best if these nominal values are defined by some authority possibly 
through a controlled vocabulary 

 A data set recording ocean salinity at multiple, fixed depths has an elevation dependency that 
can be specified by using multiple numeric values for the depths and associating those values to 
a vertical CRS specifying the vertical datum anchoring the depth value 

 A data set recording the wind speed of one or more atmospheric 'layers,' or 'non-zero vertical 
thickness surfaces,' between two isobaric levels (e.g. 1000-900 hPa) has an elevation 
dependency that can be specified, for each layer, through a pair of numeric elevation values 
specifying the bottom and the top of the layer along with a vertical CRS. The recorded values 
are related to the full thickness. 

Fully defined vertical CRSs are critical for the proper expression of elevation using numeric values. 
Sources of predefined vertical CRS definitions include: 

 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Code Table 4.5 
http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes/WMO306_vI2/LatestVERSION/LatestVERSION.html  

 EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry http://www.epsg-registry.org/EPSG. 
New, custom vertical CRS definitions can be created using the data structures of the standard: 

 ISO 19111: 2007 Geographic information -- Spatial referencing by coordinates 

and expressing those in data structures in any of several binary formats, notably in XML. 

2. Scope 

This version of this Best Practice document intentionally addresses a limited number of issues related to the 
use of WMS for time-dependent and elevation-dependent data in order to produce an initial document as a 
basis for future expansion. The document considers the issues with some of the most common time-
dependent and elevation-dependent data. 

The document describes how to offer WMS layers for: 

 data with no temporal relation to 'validity time' (i.e. the Gregorian moment to which the map 
applies), 

 data with a temporal relation to 'validity time' and 

 data with a temporal relation to 'validity time' and also to some other relevant reference time. 

The document also describes how to offer WMS layers for: 

 data with no vertical dimension, 

 data with a single vertical dimension expressed as numeric values, as nominal values, as a zero 
thickness surface, or as a non-zero thickness volume, and 



 

  13/41 

 data with several vertical dimensions based on separate vertical coordinate reference systems. 

The document specifies the use of the dimensions time and elevation defined in the WMS standard and 
also the use of a newly defined dimension reference_time. 

The document also specifies constraints on the behavior of WMS clients that have been created specifically 
to use WMS implementations that follow the requirements of this document. This document specifies a 
constrained, consistent interpretation of the WMS 1.3 standard that is applicable to government, academic, 
or commercial providers or users of time-dependent or elevation-dependent data offered as a WMS product. 

This version of this Best Practice document has left many issues out of its scope. Design issues with 
WMS such as issues related to offering a large number of layers or to offering data that are updated 
frequently were not directly tackled. Issues in the workflow of users relying of a distributed spatial data 
infrastructure such as the discovery of services, or directly of layers, were not examined. Rules for the 
use of data using climatological periods, climatological ranges and non-Gregorian calendars proved too 
complex for this version. No work was done to address issues related to expressing the semantic 
content of particular layers. Developing a mechanism to obtain visualizations of non-horizontal data 
such as vertical slices was considered but rejected as this would require modification of the design of 
WMS itself. Related work on the internationalization of human visible text and on styling has been 
undertaken as separate efforts.

6. Requirements 

This document defines injunctions for the use of OGC Web Map Service implementations for the 
distribution of map visualizations based on data with temporal or elevation dependencies. The 
injunctions constrain how such data offerings should be structured into WMS layers, the way such 
layers should be described in the WMS Capabilities document, the way requests for such layers should 
be handled, and the way clients should issue requests for such layers. These injunctions do not 
necessitate modifications to the WMS standard but merely define rules for the use of that standard. 

The injunctions of this document target server and client implementations. “Conformant WMS servers” 
are WMS server implementations that follow the injunctions of this document to offer time-dependent 
or elevation-dependent data as WMS layers. This document places restrictions on how these layers will 
be structured so that it will be useful to general purpose client software applications and to advanced 
client software applications specifically built for the needs of the community. “Conformant WMS 
clients” are WMS clients that are expected to provide a user interface to select dimensional values; this 
document places certain restrictions on these clients to reduce the chance of confusion or error. 

The WMS 1.3.0 standard defines a system for declaring and requesting map layers with more 
dimensions than the two spatial dimensions represented in the map visualization. The standard defines 
a mechanism to assign dimensions to a map layer in the Capabilities document and then defines two 
specific dimensions, time and elevation. A WMS Layer is declared to be available at one or more 
values in a dimension by declaring an XML <Dimension> element either in the <Layer> element itself 
or in a parent layer, in which case the dimension will be inherited. For example, a Capabilities 
document might contain: 
 

<Layer> 
   ... 
   <Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601” default=”1970-01-01” 
              nearestValue=”0” current=”0” 
              >1900-01-01/2010-12-31/P1D</Dimension> 
   <Layer> 
       <Name>Surface_Irradiance</Name> 
       ... 
   </Layer> 
   <Layer> 
       <Name>Temperature</Name> 
       ... 
       <Dimension name=”elevation” units=”computed_surface” unitSymbol=”” 
                  default=”surface” multipleValues=”0” nearestValue=”0” 
                  >surface,tropopause</Dimension> 
                   
   </Layer> 
</Layer> 
 

where the outer layer defines a temporal dimension which is inherited by both inner layers and the 
inner layer Temperature also declares that it is available at two heights. The time dimension is 
declared with a <Dimension name=”time” ...> element and the corresponding GetMap request may 
include the condition TIME=t with the parameter name TIME and an appropriate value t. The 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   18/41 

elevation dimension is declared with a <Dimension name=”elevation” ...> element and the 
corresponding GetMap request may include the condition ELEVATION=z with the parameter name 
ELEVATION and an appropriate value z. Further dimensions can be declared with a <Dimension 
name=”somename” ...> element and the corresponding GetMap request may include the condition 
DIM_SOMENAME=v with the parameter name DIM_SOMENAME and an appropriate value v. 

While the mechanism defined by WMS 1.3.0 is powerful, it unfortunately also has limitations. The 
mechanism does not provide any way to declare that dimensions are exclusive of one another. As a 
result, elevation-dependent data accessible using different vertical units, say meters and millibars, must 
be split into separate layers (otherwise GetMap requests with both values would cause problematic 
errors). The mechanism does not provide any alternate way to declare what combinations of values in 
the different dimensions are available, making the discovery of available combinations a guessing 
game for the client. 

Another limitation is that the WMS 1.3.0 protocol does not provide a general mechanism to return 
supplemental information for a request. However, the need for such a mechanism is widespread, 
especially for the handling of multi-dimensional layers. Consider for example a GetMap request with 
no value for a dimension of the requested layer. The WMS server shall use the default value in such a 
case, but the issuer of the request will not know the value that was actually used in preparing the 
response. Chapter C.4.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 specification addresses this issue and proposes the use of the 
HTTP response header for a transmission of the default value. 

A second scenario is the applicability of dimension values in GetMap requests for multiple layers. 
Chapter C.3.5 of the WMS 1.3.0 specification considers this case and requires conformant WMS 
servers to apply a dimension value that is given in a GetMap request only to those layers that have that 
dimension. The value is ignored for all other layers. Here, a map is returned and the issuer of the 
request will not know the layers to which the dimension value has been applied. A solution, similar to 
the one described in chapter C.4.2, could be the use of the HTTP response header. 

The solution with the HTTP response header has several drawbacks, however. It is only available to 
clients aware of its presence and able to get the header, and the solution only works when the WMS 
messaging is directly embedded in the HTTP header rather than, say, embedded in XML (i.e. SOAP). 
The solution is also unreliable as a source of error prevention because the absence of the header does 
not indicate anything since the request may have been satisfactory. 

The need for supplemental information for GetMap requests is one of the motivations for the 
development of WMS 2.0. This Best Practice document will therefore neither make requirements nor 
recommendations for how this problem should be handled. It seems better to wait for the solution 
developed in WMS 2.0. 

This clause specifies requirements and recommendations for the use of the time dimension and the 
elevation dimension defined in the WMS standard, and for the use of a new dimension named 
reference_time. This specification considers only the OGC standard: 

OpenGIS® Web Map Server Implementation Specification, version 1.3.0 (OGC 06-042) 



 

  19/41 

which is the only version of the standard that has not been deprecated at the time of writing of this Best 
Practice document. 

6.1 Time Independent Data 
Data providers may wish to offer WMS layers that have no time dependency that can be mapped to 
’validity time‘. In this case the following requirements apply: 

Req. 1 Conformant WMS servers SHALL not offer data as a WMS layer for which a dimension 
named time is declared or inherited in the Capabilities document if these data have no 
temporal dependency that can be mapped to ‘validity time.’  

6.2 Time-Dependent Data 
Complex data sets can have temporal dependencies of many kinds. This Best Practice document 
focuses on two in particular. 

The most pervasive temporal dependency comes from data values having different chronological times: 
observations may have been recorded at different moments, models may be predicting conditions for 
different days, alerts may refer to conditions expected at certain moments in the future, and warnings 
may apply to the entire duration of a time interval or part of it. This document adopts the phrase 
'validity time' in reference to this type of temporal dependency despite the potentially misleading 
natural language association of the root 'validity.' This concept is essentially identical to the concept of 
'phenomenonTime' from the standard ISO 19156:2011, Geographic information -- Observations and 
measurements. This document reserves the dimension time for this type of temporal dependency, 
which refers to the applicability of the data to the chronological Gregorian calendar. 

Frequently, data are additionally temporally dependent relative to some reference time instant: 
observations may have an accession time into a data repository, numerical weather forecasts may have 
a nominal time where observations have been assimilated to initialize the calculation, and alerts may 
have a time when they are issued or published. The diversity of such references precludes defining a 
dimension type with explicit semantics though the need for a mechanism to distinguish data based on 
some temporal referent is widely shared. This document therefore defines a generic dimension called 
reference_time, which may be used for any of these situations. If it is used, however, the 
requirements specify that the semantics must be elucidated in the <Abstract> element of the Layer in 
which the dimension is defined. 

The following sub-clauses distinguish all WMS offerings based on their temporal dependency. For data 
with a temporal dependency that can be mapped to validity time, sub-clause 6.2.1 applies. For data with 
a temporal dependency that can be mapped to validity time and another temporal dependency that can 
be mapped to a referential instant in time, sub-clause 6.2.2 applies. 

6.2.1 TIME axis 
Data providers may wish to offer data that have a temporal dependency that can be mapped to 'validity 
time,' in which case the dimension TIME SHALL be used in accordance with the following guidelines: 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   20/41 

Req. 2 Conformant WMS servers SHALL only offer data that have a temporal dependency that 
can be mapped to 'validity time' as a WMS layer for which a dimension named time is 
declared or inherited in the Capabilities document. 

Req. 3 Conformant WMS clients SHALL use the request parameter TIME only to refer to 
'validity time' which refers to the applicability of the data to the chronological Gregorian 
calendar.  

Req. 4 Conformant WMS servers SHALL aggregate multiple data sets differing only in 'validity 
time' values into a single WMS Layer with a time dimension. 

Req. 5 Conformant WMS servers SHALL set the time dimension units value to ISO8601 to 
indicate time values conformant with the standard ISO8601:2004.  

Req. 6 Conformant WMS servers and clients SHALL specify all TIME values in UTC in 
accordance with the rules of ISO 8601:2004. 

Req. 7 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each time dimension of the Capabilities 
document the attribute default and assign it the time value that will be used for maps 
returned in response to requests that do not specify a TIME value as specified in Annex 
C.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard.  

The use of a default value for TIME is intended for mass-market clients. 

Rec. a Conformant WMS servers SHOULD declare, for any layer that declares a time 
dimension in the Capabilities document, an Abstract property for the same layer, as 
defined in clause 7.2.4.6 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard. The Abstract property should 
explain the policy used to choose the default value for the time dimension. 

Rec. b The default time dimension value SHOULD be the value that is closest to the time at 
which the request was received. 

Req. 8 Conformant WMS servers SHALL express the values of the time dimension either as 
one time interval with non-zero resolution when the temporal dependency of the data is 
time instants or as a comma separated list of timestamps. 

The WMS 1.3 specification allows the possibility to define multiple times as several 
triplets: start/end/interval. The triplets define sets of time instants that may overlap. It is 
difficult for a human reader to determine the allowed times of the time dimension. 
Hence, this Best Practice document does not recommend the specification of the time 
dimension as a list of triplets, except if the time instants are regularly spaced with a 
unique interval of time. 



 

  21/41 

Req. 9 Conformant WMS servers SHALL express the values of the time dimension as one time 
interval with zero resolution when the temporal dependency of the data is related to 
validity periods. Each period has to be part of this time interval. 

Example: Consider the warnings shown in Figure 1. If all warnings are represented as a 
single layer with a time dimension, then this dimension should be defined as follows: 

<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601” default=”2012-08-16”  
nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2012-08-10/2012-08-16</Dimension> 

Req. 10 Conformant WMS servers SHALL include, for all <Dimension ... /> elements declared 
in the Capabilities document with the name time, a nearestValue field with the value 
set to 0 (ASCII zero), indicating false. 

Req. 11 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception 
to a GetMap request that has a TIME request element set to a valid value but that value is 
not in the domain set of the time dimension for any of the layers specified in the request. 

Example: Consider two layers, one for temperature observations and one for precipitation 
observations. The temperature values are measured every 5 minutes while the 
precipitation values are measured every 15 minutes. The measurement times of the 
observations are specified in a time dimension. The time dimension of the temperature 
layer may be: 

<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601”  
default=”2013-09-24T23:55:00Z” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2013-09-22T12:00:00Z/2013-09-24T12:00:00Z/PT5M</Dimension> 

The time dimension of the precipitation layer may be: 
<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601”  
default=”2013-09-24” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2013-09-22T12:00:00Z/2013-09-24T12:00:00Z/PT15M</Dimension> 

If a user specifies a GetMap request for both layers with the TIME parameter values 
2013-09-23T12:00:00Z and 2013-09-23T12:15:00Z, then these timestamps are in the 
domain of both time dimensions. The WMS server shall return a valid map. But if the 
user specifies the timestamp 2013-09-23T:12:25:00Z as a third TIME parameter value, 
then this value is not in the domain of the precipitation layer. The WMS server shall 
respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception. 

Rec. c For each invalid dimension value, the exception text SHOULD include the list of layers 
that do not have this value in their domain sets of the time dimension. 

Req. 12 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with a NoMatch exception to a GetMap 
request that includes a TIME value for which a match could not be found for at least one 
layer. This requirement addresses the case where the time value specified in the request 
is found in the domain sets of some but not all of the layers in the request. 

Example: Consider the warnings shown in Figure 1. If all warnings are represented in a 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   22/41 

single layer with a time dimension, then this dimension may be defined as follows: 
<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601”  
default=”2012-08-16” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2012-08-10/2012-08-16</Dimension> 

If a user specifies a GetMap request for that layer with the TIME parameter values 2012-
08-12T00:00:00Z and 2012-08-12T13:00:00Z, then these timestamps are in the domain 
of the time dimension. However, the timestamp 2012-08-12T00:00:00Z will match no 
warning. The GetMap request shall respond with a NoMatch exception. 

Rec. d The exception text SHOULD include the list of time values that do not match all 
requested layers. 

Req. 13 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each time dimension of the Capabilities 
document the attribute current and assign it the appropriate Boolean value, either 0 
(ASCII zero) or 1 (ASCII one) meaning false and true respectively, as specified in 
Annex C.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard. Conformant WMS servers SHALL set the 
current attribute value to 1 (ASCII one) meaning true for any layer produced from data 
which are continually updated. 

Rec. e Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify a value for the TIME parameter in any 
GetMap request including a WMS Layer for which a time dimension has been defined in 
the Capabilities document. 
This recommendation to include the TIME parameter in every GetMap request rather 
than relying on the default value is intended to increase precision and is primarily 
intended for specialized WMS client software. The use of a default value for TIME is 
intended for mass-market WMS client applications. 

Conformant WMS servers can handle GetMap Requests according to the following decision tree. 

 

 



 

  23/41 

Figure 4: Decision tree for TIME in a GetMap request 

6.2.2 REFERENCE_TIME axis 
Data providers may wish to offer data that have a second temporal dependency other than the 'validity 
time'. Examples are the start times of numerical weather calculations or the sending times of warnings. 
The semantic meaning of a second temporal dependency may differ for different types of data, but the 
usage pattern has broad application. This Best Practice document recommends the use of a dimension 
called REFERENCE_TIME if the domain values of this dimension can be restricted to timestamps. 
Hence, in contrast to the time dimension, a value of the REFERENCE_TIME dimension can not be a 
time interval. Values for this dimension can be specified in client requests using the 
DIM_REFERENCE_TIME element. As a client request sets a unique value for the 
DIM_REFERENCE_TIME, a single request cannot be used to request multiple layers that implement 
different semantics. 

The dimension REFERENCE_TIME shall be used in accordance with the following guidelines: 

Req. 14 Conformant WMS servers SHALL use the dimension REFERENCE_TIME only for data 
that have a temporal dependency to 'validity time' and also a temporal dependency to 
some relevant reference timestamp, such as the beginning of an analysis, a time of data 
collection, or a time of issuance. Conformant WMS servers SHALL use a 
REFERENCE_TIME dimension only if a TIME dimension has also been declared in the 
same or a parent layer. 

Req. 15 Conformant WMS clients SHALL use the request parameter REFERENCE_TIME only 
to refer to a temporal axis other than validity time and in accordance with all other 
requirements in this sub-clause. 

Rec. f Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify the value of the DIM_REFERENCE_TIME 
in the GetMap request if the Capabilities document declares a REFERENCE_TIME 
dimension for the layer in the request. 

Req. 16 Conformant WMS servers SHALL use the dimension REFERENCE_TIME only with 
units declared using the units identifier ”ISO8601” to indicate time values conformant 
with the standard ISO8601:2004. 

Req. 17 Conformant WMS servers and clients SHALL specify all REFERENCE_TIME values in 
UTC and according to the rules of ISO 8601:2004.  

Req. 18 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each REFERENCE_TIME dimension of 
the Capabilities document the attribute default and assign it the value of 
REFERENCE_TIME that will be used for requests that do not specify a 
REFERENCE_TIME value. 

The use of a default value for REFERENCE_TIME is intended for mass-market clients. 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   24/41 

Rec. g Conformant WMS servers SHOULD declare, for any Layer that declares a 
REFERENCE_TIME dimension in the Capabilities document, an Abstract property for 
the same Layer, as defined in clause 7.2.4.6 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard. The Abstract 
property should explain the semantics of the REFERENCE_TIME dimension and the 
policy used to choose the default value for the REFERENCE_TIME dimension. 

Req. 19 Conformant WMS servers SHALL express the values of the REFERENCE_TIME 
dimension either as a comma separated list of timestamps or as one time interval with 
non-zero resolution. 

Req. 20 Conformant WMS clients SHALL express the value of a REFERENCE_TIME parameter 
in a GetMap request either as a comma separated list of timestamps or as a time interval 
with a resolution value of zero. 

Req. 21 Conformant WMS servers SHALL include, for all <Dimension ... /> elements declared 
in the Capabilities document with the name REFERENCE_TIME, a nearestValue field 
with the value set to 0 (ASCII zero), indicating false. 

Req. 22 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception 
to a GetMap request which has a DIM_REFERENCE_TIME request element set to a 
valid value but that value is not declared in the Capabilities document as available for 
any of the layers specified in the request.  

Rec. h The exception text SHOULD include the list of layers which do not have this value 
declared in their domain sets of the REFERENCE_TIME dimension. 

Req. 23 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with a NoMatch exception to a GetMap 
request that includes a DIM_REFERENCE_TIME value for which a match could not be 
found for at least one of the layers specified in the request. This requirement addresses 
the case where the DIM_REFERENCE_TIME value specified in the request is found in 
the domain sets of some but not all of the layers in the request. 

Example: Consider a sequence of one month of successive forecasts, some of which are 
shown in Table 1. All the forecasts may be represented in a single layer with both time 
and reference-time dimensions. The reference-time dimension may be defined to 
represent the nominal start times of the forecasts, as follows: 

<Dimension name=”reference_time” units=”ISO8601” 
 default=”2009-11-30T12:00” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>20009-11-01T00:00/2009-11-30T12:00/PT12H</Dimension> 

If a user specifies a GetMap request for that layer with the REFERENCE_TIME 
parameter values 2009-11-26T00:00Z, 2009-11-26T12:00Z and 2009-11-27T00:00Z, 
then these timestamps are in the domain of the time dimension. If however, the forecast 
for 2009-11-27T00:00Z, with its four validity times, is missing because of operational 
production problems, the timestamp 2009-11-27T00:00Z will match no available 



 

  25/41 

forecast. The GetMap request shall respond with a NoMatch exception. 

Req. 24 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each REFERENCE_TIME dimension of 
the Capabilities document the attribute current and assign it the appropriate boolean 
value, either 0 (ASCII zero) or 1 (ASCII one) meaning false and true respectively, as 
specified in Annex C.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard. Conformant WMS servers SHALL 
set the current attribute value to 1 (ASCII one) meaning true for any layer produced 
from data that are continually updated. 

Conformant WMS servers can handle GetMap Requests according to the decision tree shown in Figure 
5. Note that in Figure 5 the REFERENCE_TIME value is considered set in the request only if it is 
assigned a value in the request. 

 

Figure 5: Decision tree for REFERENCE_TIME in a GetMap request 

6.3 No vertical dependency 
Data providers may wish to offer data that have no vertical dependency, in which case the following 
requirements apply: 

Req. 25 Conformant WMS servers SHALL not offer data as a WMS layer for which a dimension 
named elevation is declared or inherited in the Capabilities document if these data have 
no vertical dependency. 

6.4 Elevation-dependent data 
Complex data sets can have elevation dependencies of many kinds. Data might be referenced to the 
distance above mean sea level, distance below the surface of the sea, depth below the earth surface, 
distance from the calculated center of the earth, or height in the atmosphere; possibly metric, 
barometric, or a named surface. 

Data sets being offered as elevation dependent WMS layers must define that dependency according to 
the type of elevation values present. Data without any elevation dependency must not declare or inherit 
any elevation dimension. This section applies to all data sets with elevation-dependent data. Data 
sets, which are available at one or more elevations specified by numeric values, must follow the 
injunctions of sub-clause 6.4.1. Data sets that are available at elevations specified for a named surface 
must follow the injunctions of sub-clause 6.4.2. 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   26/41 

In all cases, the dimension ELEVATION must be used in accordance with the following: 

Req. 26 Conformant WMS servers SHALL offer any data that have a vertical dependency that can 
be referenced to numeric or named surface as a WMS Layer with an elevation 
dimension. 

Req. 27 Conformant WMS servers and clients SHALL use the dimension ELEVATION only to 
refer to a vertical axis having numeric values or named surfaces. 

Req. 28 Conformant WMS servers SHALL NOT declare in the Capabilities document a WMS 
Layer with an elevation dimension that includes both numeric and named surfaces. 

Req. 29 Conformant WMS servers SHALL aggregate multiple data sets differing only in 
elevation values into a single WMS layer with an elevation dimension. This will avoid 
multiple independent layers related by a common coordinate reference system (CRS). 

Req. 30 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each elevation dimension of the 
Capabilities document the attribute multipleValues and SHALL assign it the boolean 
value 0 (ASCII zero) indicating false as specified in Annex C.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 
standard. 

Req. 31 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each elevation dimension of the 
Capabilities document the attribute nearestValue and assign it the boolean value 0 
(ASCII zero) indicating false as specified in Annex C.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard.  

The following sub-clauses distinguish all WMS offerings based on their vertical dependency. For data 
with a vertical dependency referenced to numeric values, sub-clause 6.4.1 applies. For data with a 
vertical dependency referenced to named surfaces, sub-clause 6.4.2 applies. 

6.4.1 ELEVATION axis using numeric values 
Data providers may wish to offer data that have a vertical dependency that can be referenced to 
numeric values, in which case the following requirements apply: 

Req. 32 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each elevation dimension of the 
Capabilities document the attribute UNITS and assign it a CRS identifier specifying the 
vertical CRS. Elevation metric values SHALL be expressed in units of the CRS. 

Req. 33 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each elevation dimension of the 
Capabilities document the attribute UNITSYMBOL and SHALL assign it the string 
representation of the symbol for the units.  

Req. 34 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each elevation dimension of the 
Capabilities document the attribute default and SHALL assign it the ELEVATION 



 

  27/41 

value that will be used for requests that do not specify an elevation value. 

Rec. i Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify a value for the ELEVATION parameter in 
any GetMap request including a WMS Layer for which an elevation dimension has 
been defined in the Capabilities document. 

Rec. j Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify in GetMap requests only metric values 
declared in the elevation dimension. Where the metric value declared in the 
Capabilities document represents a layer of non-zero vertical thickness, the GetMap 
requests SHOULD specify ELEVATION using the pairs of values exactly as stated in 
the list of available elevations. 

Req. 35 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in each elevation dimension of the 
Capabilities document the attribute current and assign it the Boolean value 0 (ASCII 
zero) indicating false as specified in Annex C.2 of the WMS 1.3.0 standard. This means 
that the vertical axis SHALL be static, i.e. the domain set values of the axis are not 
continually updated. 

Rec. k Conformant WMS servers offering any data that have a vertical dependency that can be 
referenced to metric values SHOULD sort lists of elevation metric values in order from 
nearest the surface of the Earth (or ocean) to farthest from the surface. In other words, 
lower elevations should come before higher elevations, and shallower depths should 
come before greater depths. 

Req. 36 Conformant WMS servers SHALL express the values of the elevation dimension either 
as a comma separated list of numeric values or as one interval with non-zero resolution if 
the vertical dependency of the data is referenced by discrete values. 

Req. 37 Conformant WMS servers SHALL express the values of the elevation dimension as an 
interval with zero resolution, if the vertical dependency contains ranges, i.e. at least one 
layer element is a range. All ranges have to be part of this interval. 

Example: Consider a data set recording wind speed of several atmospheric surfaces. Each 
surface or ‘thick slice’ is defined by the space between two isobaric levels (e.g. 1000-900 
hPa). All surfaces are between 1000 hPa and 100 hPa. The data set should be represented 
as a single layer with an elevation dimension. This dimension may be defined as 
follows: 

<Dimension name=”elevation” units=”someCRS:xxxx” unitSymbol=”hPa” 
default=”1000” multipleValues=”0” nearestValue=”0” 
current=”0”>100/1000</Dimension> 

Req. 38 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception 
to a GetMap request that has an ELEVATION request element set to a valid value but 
that value is not in the domain set of the elevation dimension for any of the layers

specified in the request 

Rec. l For each invalid dimension value, the exception text SHOULD include the list of layers 
that do not have this value in their domain sets of the elevation dimension. 

Req. 39 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with a NoMatch exception to a GetMap 
request that includes an ELEVATION value for which a match could not be found for at 
least one layer. This requirement addresses the case where the elevation value specified 
in the request is found in the domain sets of some but not all of the layers in the request. 

Example: Consider a data set recording wind speed of several atmospheric surfaces. Each 
surface or ‘thick slice’ is defined by the space between two isobaric levels (e.g. 1000-900 
hPa). All surfaces are between 1000 hPa and 100 hPa. The data set should be represented 
as a single layer with an elevation dimension. This dimension may be defined as 
follows: 

<Dimension name=”elevation” units=”someCRS:xxxx” unitSymbol=”hPa” 
default=”1000” multipleValues=”0” nearestValue=”0” 
current=”0”>100/1000</Dimension> 

Assume that the surface or ‘thick slice’ defined by the isobaric levels 700-600 hPa is 
missing. If a user specifies a GetMap request for the layer with the elevation parameter 
values 550 and 650, then these values are in the domain of the elevation dimension. 
However, the value 650 will match no surface. The GetMap request shall respond with a 
NoMatch exception. 

6.4.2 ELEVATION axis using named surfaces 
Data providers may wish to offer data that have a vertical dependency that can be referenced to named 
surfaces, in which case the following requirements apply: 

Req. 40 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in the elevation dimension the attribute 
UNITS and SHALL assign it the value computed_surface, 
UNITS=”computed_surface”. 

Req. 41 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in the elevation dimension the attribute 
UNITSYMBOL and SHALL assign it the value of the null string, UNITSYMBOL=””. 

Req. 42 Conformant WMS servers SHALL declare in the elevation dimension the attribute 
default and SHALL assign it the named surface that will be used for requests that do 
not specify an elevation value. 

Req. 43 Conformant WMS servers SHALL assign to the values of the elevation dimension the 
named surface or named surfaces of the vertical dependency.

Annex A: Dimensions and Coordinates 

In physics and mathematics the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum 
number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it (see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension). Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one 
coordinate is needed to specify the location of a point on it. A map has two dimensions because two 
coordinates are needed to locate a point on it. These coordinates are usually latitude and longitude. 

A dimension is described by a domain. The domain is a set of values having all the same type, e.g. 
number, string or date. A coordinate of the dimension D is a value in D’s domain. For an example, 
consider a time dimension with a domain that contains all date values between January 1st 2010 and 
June 16th 2013. March 10th 2012 will be a valid coordinate in this dimension. Sometimes, a dimension 
is associated with a unit, e.g. meter or hectoPascal (hPa). This may allow the transformation of the 
domain into another domain with a different unit if a transformation formula exists. 

A WMS is a standardized interface to visualize two-dimensional maps. However, the data behind a 
map, the so-called layer, may have more than two dimensions. 

The WMS specification allows the definition of multi-dimensional layers. Then, each layer object is 
explicitly assigned a pair of coordinates for every dimension. This pair defines an interval on the 
dimension. The coordinate pairs for latitude and longitude specify the bounding box of the layer object. 
The bounding box is assigned to the layer rather than to the layer objects because the box has to be 
identical for all layer objects. 

Let [xi,yi] be the coordinate interval of a layer object L in the dimension i. A coordinate interval [ai,bi] 
in dimension i matches L if and only if [ai,bi] overlaps [xi,yi], i.e. xi ≤ bi and ai ≤ yi. Note that this 
statement can be simplified if ai = bi. I.e. The coordinate interval reduces to a single coordinate. A 
coordinate ci in dimension i matches L if and only if xi ≤ci ≤ yi. 

So, if a request is made to a WMS for a map on a coordinate ci in dimension i, then the WMS server 
should produce this map from all layer objects which are matched by ci. 

Consider for example a layer with warnings. Each warning is for a geographic area and is associated 
with a time, when the warning becomes effective, and a time when the warning expires. Thus, this 
layer has a time dimension. If a user wants to get a map that shows all warnings that are effective 
today at 20:00 UTC, then a GetMap request with this time coordinate has to be submitted to the WMS 
server. The server selects all warnings that are matched by the time coordinate and produces a map that 
visualizes the geographic areas of these warnings. 

Another example is the distribution of ozone concentration. Such a layer may be composed of four 
coverages. The first coverage contains the total sum of ozone concentration for the elevation between 
0m and 10m. The second coverage contains the total sum of ozone concentration for the elevation 
between 10m and 100m. The third resp. forth coverage contains the total sum of ozone concentration 
for the elevation between 100m and 500m resp. 500m and 2000m. Thus, this layer has a third 
dimension, the elevation. The domain of this dimension consists of numbers. The unit is meter. If this 
is a request for the ozone concentration between 0m and 50m at a geographic point, then a 



 

  31/41 

corresponding GetFeatureInfo request is sent to the WMS server. The interval [0,50] matches the first 
and the second coverage. Hence, the WMS server should return the value at the given point for both 
coverages. 

The WMS specification provides the optional <Dimension> element for a declaration of additional 
dimensions. The mandatory fields of a <Dimension> element are the name, the units and the extent. 
The extent should indicate the available values of the corresponding dimension. The units element 
denotes the domain type of a dimension and the extent describes the values of the dimension’s domain. 
For example, latitude and longitude can be declared as <Dimension> elements. 

<Dimension name=”latitude” units=”degree” unitSymbol=”°” 
 default=”0”>-90/90/0</Dimension> 
<Dimension name=”longitude” units=”degree” unitSymbol=”°” 
 default=”0”>-180/180</Dimension> 
 

The extent of latitude, or longitude, is a range because every value in the range will be a valid 
coordinate of this dimension. 

Each dimension of a layer, other than latitude and longitude, has to be declared in the Capabilities 
document. 

The time dimension of the previous warning layer example may be declared as follows: 

<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601” default=”2013-06-27T12:00:00Z” 
>2013-06-26/2013-06-30</Dimension> 
 

The extent is a time interval and every timestamp in this interval is considered to be a valid time 
coordinate for this time dimension. 

If the upper and the lower bounds are equal for every coordinate interval of a dimension, i.e. each 
coordinate interval is in fact a single coordinate, then the extent of this dimension should be a list of 
these coordinates and not an interval, because only these coordinates will match with an object of the 
layer.

Annex B: GetFeatureInfo 

GetFeatureInfo is an optional operation. This operation is designed to provide clients of a WMS with 
more information about features in the pictures of maps that were returned by previous GetMap 
requests. It is only supported for those layers for which the attribute queryable="1" (true) has been 
defined or inherited. 

The canonical use case for GetFeatureInfo is that a user sees the response of a GetMap request and 
chooses a point (I,J) on that map for which to obtain more information. The basic operation provides 
the ability for a client to specify which pixel is being queried, which layer(s) should be investigated, 
and in what format the information should be returned. In the case where the requested layers have 
additional dimensions for time or elevation the GetFeatureInfo operation can be used to ask for time 
series or other series at the chosen point. 

This chapter defines additional requirements and recommendations for the use of the GetFeatureInfo 
operation. Further, those requirements from Section 6, which apply not only to a GetMap request but 
also to a GetFeatureInfo request, are listed. 

The WMS 1.3.0 specification defines the following two requirements for GetFeatureInfo: 

WMS 1.3 
requirement  

Conformant WMS clients SHALL not issue a GetFeatureInfo request for layers 
for which the attribute queryable="1" (true) has not been defined or inherited. 

WMS 1.3 
requirement  

Conformant WMS servers SHALL answer with an OperationNotSupported 
exception to a GetFeatureInfo request if the server will not support this 
operation. 

For this Best Practice document we define further requirements. These are: 

Req. 44 Conformant WMS servers SHALL set the attribute queryable to “1”, indicating true, 
for all layers declared in the Capabilities document which have any dimension 
involving time or elevation. 

Req. 45 If a time dimension has been set for a layer, conformant queryable WMS servers 
SHALL return a feature collection to a GetFeatureInfo request where each feature 
includes the element “time” with a timestamp associated to the feature.  

Req. 46 If a reference time dimension has been set for a layer, conformant WMS servers 
SHALL return a feature collection to a GetFeatureInfo request where each feature 
includes the element “reference_time” with a timestamp associated to the feature.  

Req. 47 If an elevation dimension has been set for a layer, conformant WMS servers SHALL 
return a feature collection to a GetFeatureInfo request where each feature includes the 



 

  33/41 

element “elevation” with an according elevation value.  

 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   34/41 

The following requirements and recommendations which apply to a GetMap request also apply to a 
GetFeatureInfo request: Reqs: 11, 12, 20, 22, 23, 38, 39 and Recs: e, f, j, k. These are copied below for 
convenience. 

Req. 11 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception 
to a GetMap request that has a TIME request element set to a valid value but that value is 
not in the domain set of the time dimension for any of the layers specified in the request. 

Example: Consider two layers, one for temperature observations and one for precipitation 
observations. The temperature values are measured every 5 minutes while the 
precipitation values are measured every 15 minutes. The measurement times of the 
observations are specified in a time dimension. The time dimension of the temperature 
layer may be: 

<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601”  
default=”2013-09-24T23:55:00Z” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2013-09-22T12:00:00Z/2013-09-24T12:00:00Z/PT5M</Dimension> 

The time dimension of the precipitation layer may be: 
<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601”  
default=”2013-09-24” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2013-09-22T12:00:00Z/2013-09-24T12:00:00Z/PT15M</Dimension> 

If a user specifies a GetMap request for both layers with the TIME parameter values 
2013-09-23T12:00:00Z and 2013-09-23T12:15:00Z, then these timestamps are in the 
domain of both time dimensions. The WMS server shall return a valid map. But if the 
user specifies the timestamp 2013-09-23T:12:25:00Z as a third TIME parameter value, 
then this value is not in the domain of the precipitation layer. The WMS server shall 
respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception. 

Req. 12 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with a NoMatch exception to a GetMap 
request that includes a TIME value for which a match could not be found for at least one 
layer. This requirement addresses the case where the time value specified in the request 
is found in the domain sets of some but not all of the layers in the request. 

Example: Consider the warnings shown in Figure 1. If all warnings are represented in a 
single layer with a time dimension, then this dimension may be defined as follows: 

<Dimension name=”time” units=”ISO8601”  
default=”2012-08-16” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>2012-08-10/2012-08-16</Dimension> 

If a user specifies a GetMap request for that layer with the TIME parameter values 2012-
08-12T00:00:00Z and 2012-08-12T13:00:00Z, then these timestamps are in the domain 
of the time dimension. However, the timestamp 2012-08-12T00:00:00Z will match no 
warning. The GetMap request shall respond with a NoMatch exception. 

Rec. e Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify a value for the TIME parameter in any 
GetMap request including a WMS Layer for which a time dimension has been defined in 
the Capabilities document. 



 

  35/41 

This recommendation to include the TIME parameter in every GetMap request rather 
than relying on the default value is intended to increase precision and is primarily 
intended for specialized WMS client software. The use of a default value for TIME is 
intended for mass-market WMS client applications. 

Rec. f Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify the value of the DIM_REFERENCE_TIME 
in the GetMap request if the Capabilities document declares a REFERENCE_TIME 
dimension for the layer in the request. 

Req. 20 Conformant WMS clients SHALL express the value of a REFERENCE_TIME parameter 
in a GetMap request either as a comma separated list of timestamps or as a time interval 
with a resolution value of zero. 

Req. 22 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception to 
a GetMap request which has a DIM_REFERENCE_TIME request element set to a valid 
value but that value is not declared in the Capabilities document as available for any of 
the layers specified in the request.  

Req. 23 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with a NoMatch exception to a GetMap 
request that includes a DIM_REFERENCE_TIME value for which a match could not be 
found for at least one of the layers specified in the request. This requirement addresses 
the case where the DIM_REFERENCE_TIME value specified in the request is found in 
the domain sets of some but not all of the layers in the request. 
Example: Consider a sequence of one month of successive forecasts, some of which are 
shown in Table 1. All the forecasts may be represented in a single layer with both time 
and reference-time dimensions. The reference-time dimension may be defined to 
represent the nominal start times of the forecasts, as follows: 

<Dimension name=”reference_time” units=”ISO8601” 
 default=”2009-11-30T12:00” nearestValue=”0” current=”0”  
>20009-11-01T00:00/2009-11-30T12:00/PT12H</Dimension> 

If a user specifies a GetMap request for that layer with the REFERENCE_TIME 
parameter values 2009-11-26T00:00Z, 2009-11-26T12:00Z and 2009-11-27T00:00Z, 
then these timestamps are in the domain of the time dimension. If however, the forecast 
for 2009-11-27T00:00Z, with its four validity times, is missing because of operational 
production problems, the timestamp 2009-11-27T00:00Z will not match any available 
forecast. The GetMap request shall respond with a NoMatch exception. 

Rec. j Conformant WMS clients SHOULD specify in GetMap requests only metric values 
declared in the elevation dimension. Where the metric value declared in the Capabilities 
document represents a layer of non-zero vertical thickness, the GetMap requests 
SHOULD specify ELEVATION using the pairs of values exactly as stated in the list of 
available elevations. 

Rec. k Conformant WMS servers offering any data that have a vertical dependency that can be 
referenced to metric values SHOULD sort lists of elevation metric values in order from 
nearest the surface of the Earth (or ocean) to farthest from the surface. In other words, 



 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium   36/41 

lower elevations should come before higher elevations, and shallower depths should 
come before greater depths. 

Req. 38 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with an InvalidDimensionValue exception to 
a GetMap request that has an ELEVATION request element set to a valid value but that 
value is not in the domain set of the elevation dimension for any of the layers specified in 
the request 

Req. 39 Conformant WMS servers SHALL respond with a NoMatch exception to a GetMap 
request that includes an ELEVATION value for which a match could not be found for at 
least one layer. This requirement addresses the case where the elevation value specified 
in the request is found in the domain sets of some but not all of the layers in the request. 
Example: Consider a data set recording wind speed of several atmospheric surfaces. Each 
surface or ‘thick slice’ is defined by the space between two isobaric levels (e.g. 1000-900 
hPa). All surfaces are between 1000 hPa and 100 hPa. The data set should be represented 
as a single layer with an elevation dimension. This dimension may be defined as follows: 

<Dimension name=”elevation” units=”someCRS:xxxx” unitSymbol=”hPa” 
default=”1000” multipleValues=”0” nearestValue=”0” 
current=”0”>100/1000</Dimension> 

Assume that the surface or ‘thick slice’ defined by the isobaric levels 700-600 hPa is 
missing. If a user specifies a GetMap request for the layer with the elevation parameter 
values 550 and 650, then these values are in the domain of the elevation dimension. 
However, the value 650 will match no surface. The GetMap request shall respond with a 
NoMatch exception.
