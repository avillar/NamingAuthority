1. Summary



This OGC discussion paper presents an approach to harmonize the OGC GeoPackage and OWS Context standards through a set of extensions. GeoPackage is an open, standards-based, platform-independent, portable, self-describing, compact format for storing and transferring geospatial data and information as part of an SQLite database.
OWS Context is an open format linking geospatial web services and information.
A draft standard has been produced and this Discussion Paper is designed to be a companion to that draft standard to assist in discussion. The draft standard contains extensions to both GeoPackage and OWS Context.




This document is the work of collaboration between the GeoPackage and OWS Context Standards Working Groups (SWGs).




1.1. Requirements & Research Motivation


GeoPackage and OWS Context are two OGC encoding standards that have potentially complementary and overlapping uses. There are two use cases that the submitters of this discussion paper would like to see supported in a standards-based way:




	
Encoding of OWS Context content within a GeoPackage, so that a GeoPackage can load a list of OWS Contexts, present them to the user, and allow the user to select the one which most closely matches their desired activity. This would allow the OWS Context to act as a standards-based project file for GeoPackage.


	
Encoding of GeoPackage content within an OWS Context file, so that an OWS Context can refer to GeoPackage content in the same way it can refer to services, files (e.g., GML or GeoJSON), and inline content. This would increase the utility of OWS Context because GeoPackage is becoming an increasingly common container for geospatial data and information.







In addition, the intent of the OWS Context extensions is to design them in such a way that they will work with generic relational databases, not just SQLite-based GeoPackage.






1.2. Prior-After Comparison


Before this work, the GeoPackage and OWS Context standards were completely independent of each other. There was neither a standard way to encode an OWS Context in a GeoPackage nor a standard way to reference GeoPackage content in an OWS Context. In 2014, a joint OWS Context / GeoPackage SWG was formed, but unfortunately this effort did not lead to any concrete work products.




As of the date of this document, the market adoption of OWS Context appears to be fairly limited. The authors of this OGC Discussion Paper are not aware of any studies analyzing OWS Context adoption or viewpoints of what would lead to increased adoption. Acceptance of the proposals in this paper could possibly lead to increased adoption of both OWS Context and GeoPackage.




There is a community extension that allows for OWS Context files to be stored within a GeoPackage. However, this community extension encodes OWS Context content as either a JSON or Atom document. Since GeoPackage is an SQLite (relational) database, GeoPackage developers have stated that they prefer to work entirely in the SQL domain as much as possible.






1.3. Recommendations for Future Work


The GeoPackage extension presented in this paper does not define an encoding for style information. This is an essential component of OWS Context and without it the implementation is incomplete. The existing SLD encoding standard is tightly coupled to the XML format. Since, as mentioned previously, GeoPackage developers prefer to work in the SQL domain, this format is not suitable. The standardization process should be delayed until this issue is resolved.




The development of a suitable style encoding for GeoPackage is dependent on ongoing efforts by the Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) SWG and other activities as described by the Portrayal Concept Development Study. As of this writing, the SLD SWG is in the process of producing a conceptual model for SLD2 that would support multiple encodings. If this model is produced and adopted by OGC, it would be appropriate to produce a GeoPackage encoding for it.




If the approach described by this document is embraced by the relevant SWGs, the effort should culminate in a new OGC standard. This standard would be an extension to both the GeoPackage encoding standard and the OWS Context encoding standard. (Note that as far as the authors are aware, this is the first time OGC has attempted to produce a standard that is an extension to two different standards simultaneously.)

4. Overview



Section 5 (OWS Context Extensions for Relational Databases) describes extensions to the OWS Context Encoding Standard.




Section 6 (GeoPackage Extension for OWS Context) describes extensions to the GeoPackage Encoding Standard.




Section 7 (Discussion) describes design decisions and other discussion points that are relevant to the development of this set of extensions.




Annex A (OWS Context Example Document) presents an example OWS Context document in the GeoJSON format that demonstrates the use of these extensions.








5. OWS Context Extensions for Relational Databases



This section describes a set of extensions to the OWS Context Encoding Standard needed to support relational databases, including but not limited to SQLite-based GeoPackage.




5.1. SQL Resource Extension


This OWS Context extension defines a new datatype called owc:SQLResource.
This extension applies when a Context document is completely stored within a relational (SQL) database.
Since relational databases have no mechanical way to control ordering, this extension provides a new datatype that contains an element that can be implemented as a column to support ordering.




5.1.1. Datatype owc:SQLResource


This datatype extends owc:Resource with the element(s) listed in Table 1.



Table 1. Datatype owc:SQLSelectResource	Name	Definition	Data Type and Values	Multiplicity and Use
	order
	The ascending order of configured resources
	DOUBLE
	Zero or one (optional)




	
Note

	

This element is a double because the conventional way to set the order of an element in the middle of an ordered list is to set its order to a value midway between the preceding and following list elements.













5.2. SQL Content Extension


This extension defines the following:




	
a set of constraints on two existing datatypes, and


	
a new datatype.







This extension applies when a Context document refers to content within a relational (SQL) database.




5.2.1. Constraints on Datatype owc:Offering


The code of an owc:Offering element determines whether this extension is in use for that offering.
(For example, the codes for GeoPackage offerings are listed in Table 5.)
When the SQL Content Extension is in use, an owc:Offering is constrained as per Table 2.




	
Note

	

The constraints are underlined.








Table 2. Datatype owc:Offering for SQL Content Extension	Name	Definition	Data Type and Values	Multiplicity and Use
	code
	Offering Code
	CharacterString
	One (mandated)

	operation
	Operations used to invoke the service
	owc:Operation
	One (mandatory)

	content
	N/A
	N/A
	Zero (prohibited)






5.2.2. Constraints on Datatype owc:Operation


When the SQL Content Extension is in use for an offering, owc:Operation child elements of that offering are constrained as per Table 3.




	
Note

	

The constraints are underlined.








Table 3. Datatype owc:Operation for SQL Content Extension	Name	Definition	Data Type and Values	Multiplicity and Use
	code
	as per extension
	CharacterString
	One (mandated)

	method
	SELECT
	CharacterString
	One (mandated)

	type
	SQL Record Set
	CharacterString
	One (mandated)

	requestURL
	Service Request URL
	URI
	One (mandatory)

	request
	Request body content
	owc:SQLContent (Datatype owc:SQLContent)
	One (mandatory)

	result
	N/A
	N/A
	Zero (prohibited)

	extension
	Application specific content
	N/A
	Zero or more (optional)




	
Note

	

The code for GeoPackage is GPKG (other codes are possible, but have not been defined yet).
If the referenced content is within the database containing the Context, the requestURL should be .. Otherwise the requestURL should be a connect string.











5.2.3. Datatype owc:SQLContent


When the SQL Content Extension is in use for an offering (for example, the code GPKG as described in the note above), the request body content for its operation (see request above) is an owc:SQLContent as described by Table 4.
For a pure SQL implementation, clients may use the query element directly.
For a GeoPackage, the from may be more useful because it refers to a table name that can be looked up in gpkg_contents, allowing it to be used as a proper GeoPackage content type.



Table 4. Datatype owc:SQLContent	Name	Definition	Data Type and Values	Multiplicity and Use
	from
	a single table or view name
	CharacterString
	One (mandatory)

	query
	the actual SQL query
	CharacterString
	One (mandatory)

	extension
	Application specific content
	N/A
	Zero or more (optional)




	
Note

	

If joins are needed, they should be established as views beforehand so that the from element can be a single value.









	
Warning

	

It is the responsibility of the OWS Context client to verify that the query provided is safe to execute on that database. OWS Context clients may wish to construct their own queries based on the from value and the schema of that table.













5.3. GeoPackage Extension


This OWS Context extension supports content stored in a GeoPackage. This can include referencing itself (i.e., when the context and the content are in the same GeoPackage) or GeoPackages that are available on the local filesystem.




When the code of an owc:Offering is one of the codes listed in Table 5, the SQL Content Extension applies and the code for operations is GPKG. The from of the SQLContent corresponds to the name of the user-defined table in the GeoPackage. This allows clients to use gpkg_contents and other GeoPackage tables normally.

6. GeoPackage Extension for OWS Context



This section describes a GeoPackage extension that supports OWS Context. The following subsections describe each relevant table and how it should be used in GeoPackage software. The full details of each table including schema and requirements are published in the draft standard.




6.1. gpkg_extensions Table


To use this extension, add the following rows to this table:



Table 6. gpkg_extensions Rows	table_name	column_name	extension_name	definition	scope
	gpkgext_context

6.5.2. Use with Other Types of Content


OGC Web Services can be encoded in a GeoPackage-based OWS Context. The service type is determined by the code of gpkgext_context_offerings. The OWS Context Encoding Standard currently supports WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, CSW, and WMTS. The method, type, request, and result columns are consistent with the other OWS Context Encodings (see [OWSContext1.0Atom] or [OWSContext1.0GeoJSON]).

6.7. gpkgext_context_styles Table


The definition for this table is to be decided. (It will implement owc:StyleSet from [OWSContext1.0CM].)










7. Discussion



7.1. OWS Context Extensions for Relational Databases


For the most part, the development of a relational database (RDBMS) encoding for OWS Context was seamless. Only one new element (order for owc:SQLResource) had to be added. The remainder of the effort centered on identifying the appropriate set of constraints for each element and the proper codes for the offerings and operations tables. Care was taken to ensure that the extensions would apply equally to any RDBMS even though there was no immediate need for this capability at this time. To an extent, the approach described in this Discussion Paper does future-proof the effort. If nothing else, it should be seamless for someone to implement the GeoPackage schema in an RDBMS other than SQLite.






7.2. GeoPackage Extension for OWS Context


7.2.1. SQL Basis


Previous attempts to provide OWS Context support in GeoPackage (including the previously mentioned community extension) included leveraging the existing GeoJSON encoding for OWS Context. However, developers have consistently requested an SQL-based solution so that developers do not need to deal with parsing text-based documents.
This also gives developers the flexibility to take full advantage of the relational database (joins, etc.).
Accordingly, the GPKG-OWC extension was developed using a normalized table structure and a set of primary and foreign key relationships.






7.2.2. Composition of the gpkgext_context Table


This table mirrors the element names from [OWSContext1.0CM] fairly closely with a few exceptions:




	
last_change is used instead of "updateDate" to maintain consistency with gpkg_contents.


	
min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y are used instead of "areaOfInterest" to maintain consistency with gpkg_contents. In addition, srs_id is added to ensure that the coordinates are interpreted properly by applications.


	
metadata_id is used instead of "contextMetadata" because GeoPackage already has a mechanism for storing registered metadata, the Metadata Extension.


	
min_time and max_time are used instead of "timeIntervalOfInterest" because SQLite has no native way to store time intervals.









7.2.3. Composition of the gpkgext_context_resources Table


This table mirrors the element names from [OWSContext1.0CM] fairly closely with a few exceptions:




	
last_change is used instead of "updateDate" to maintain consistency with gpkg_contents.


	
min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y are used instead of "areaOfInterest" to maintain consistency with gpkg_contents. In addition, srs_id is added to ensure that the coordinates are interpreted properly by applications.


	
metadata_id is used instead of "contextMetadata" because GeoPackage already has a mechanism for storing registered metadata, the Metadata Extension.


	
min_time and max_time are used instead of "timeIntervalOfInterest" because SQLite has no native way to store time intervals.


	
description is used instead of "contentDescription" for readability.









7.2.4. Composition of owc:SQLContents


Historically, OWS Context documents have always provided an examplar request to aid developers in using the layer correctly.
The owc:SQLContents maintains this tradition with the query element. The from element was considered to be crucial because it allows access to the full scope of GeoPackage operations. There was consideration to breaking out the entire SQL query into its component parts (including WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, and GROUP BY clause) but this idea was abandoned due to excess complexity and unclear benefit.












Appendix A: OWS Context Example Document



EventKit is an application that produces GeoPackages containing selected data sources for a user-defined area of interest.
Following is an example OWS Context file that was produced to describe content generated by the EventKit application.
