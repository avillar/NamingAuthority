i. Abstract 

Applications using moving feature data, typically on vehicles and pedestrians, have 
recently been rapidly increasing. Innovative applications are expected to require the 
overlay and integration of moving feature data from different sources to create more 
social and business values. Efforts in this direction should be encouraged by ensuring 
smoother data exchange because handling and integrating moving feature data will 
broaden the market for geo-spatial information. This discussion paper provides an 
overview of some actual and potential geo-spatial applications using moving feature data 
and the existing international standards or specifications on moving feature data handling. 
It also summarizes the requirements set on the standards for moving feature data, and 
finally proposes the development of a new OGC standard for moving features.

OGC Standards for Moving Features — Requirements 

1  Scope 

This discussion paper provides an overview of some actual and potential geo-spatial 
applications using moving feature data and the existing international standards or 
specifications on moving feature data handling. It summarizes the requirements set on the 
standards for moving feature data, and finally proposes starting the development of a new 
OGC standard for moving features. 

2 Why is an OGC standard on moving features necessary? 

2.1 Market demand 

 Demand is very rapidly increasing recently for better handling of moving feature data 
with GIS. Example applications using moving feature data include traffic congestion 
information services using probe cars or taxis equipped with GPS to measure the travel 
time of each road link, tracking systems on auto-trucks for logistics management, and 
agent-based road traffic simulation systems for forecasting traffic situations. Systems 
relying on single-source moving feature data are now evolving into more integrated 
systems. Integration of moving feature data from different sources is a key to developing 
more innovative and advanced applications. The following are examples of such efforts. 

a) Integrated simulation for disaster risk management: Moving feature data is 
collected/integrated from different simulation systems such as people evacuation 
simulations, road vehicle simulations including emergency vehicles, and tsunami 
simulations. Many of them, except the tsunami simulations, are agent-based 
simulation systems that explicitly output the trajectories of individual agents, i.e., 
pedestrians and vehicles. A concrete example is described in Section 4. Real-time 
simulation and integration may be needed in support of an evacuation. 

b) Traffic information services:  Traffic congestion and the trafficability of roads can 
be estimated to provide guidance information to road users from real-time vehicle 
trajectory data collected from probe cars. Sources are becoming diversified from a 
fleet of taxis with GPS belonging to a single company to the mixture of auto-trucks, 
buses, and navigation system users. This trend makes it more necessary to integrate 
data using different models and formats. Figure 1 shows how the trajectory data from 
car navigation system users were integrated to identify the trafficability of road 
segments after the Great Earthquake of East Japan in 2011.

data from car navigation systems. 
 
Integrated data have recently been used to identify traffic accident hot spots by 
analyzing a large amount of data on vehicle trajectories and velocity/acceleration 
changes. The ITS community (ISO/CEN and ETSI) is drafting standards on the 
“Local Dynamic Map”, a platform for integrating the trajectories of many moving 
features, such as pedestrians and moving vehicles, to reduce the number of traffic 
accidents around intersections (ISO/DTS 17931(WG3), ETSI TR 102 863 V1.1.1 
(2011-06)) (Figure 2).

c) Security services: This service requires the generation and sharing of situational 
information as a common picture by integrating and visualizing data on pedestrian 
and vehicle movements collected from heterogeneous sensors like surveillance 
cameras, GPSs, and mobile phones. 

d) Navigation for Robots: Robots are expected to guide and help in the movement of 
elderly or handicapped people in public spaces like shopping malls (Shiomi et al., 
2009). Since robots can identify only near-by obstacles and moving features with 
laser range and/or vision sensors, they may require situational information on a larger 
scale, and this requires integration of the trajectory data from the moving features 
collected through sensor networks. Figure 3 shows a conceptual example of moving 
feature data integration for guiding robots.

 Moreover, the growth of smart phones in the market makes it much easier to acquire 
large amounts of data on user trajectories reflecting the movement of people and vehicles 
on a global scale and in real-time. This will create an enormous market for geo-spatial 
applications that requires the integration of moving feature data from many 
heterogeneous sources with a GIS platform.

2.2 Existing Standards for a Moving Feature 

 The standards for moving features, however, are insufficient. Different converters still 
need to be developed whenever connecting system A with system B in order to exchange 
moving feature data between systems. Table 1 summarizes the existing standards 
associated with temporally-changing geo-spatial data including moving feature data. 
ISO/TC211 published a standard (ISO 19141, 2008) on moving features. However, it is 
an abstract standard rather than an implementation specification more directly relevant 
for system development. OGC implementation specifications need to be developed based 
on ISO 19141 as indicated by “Target” in the table. The other associated standards 
include X3D for the visualization of moving features and GPX for describing trajectories 
using GPS. In addition, some of the OGC standards may be associated with moving 
feature data. Overlaps and consistency should be taken into account in the process of 
developing the OGC standards for moving features.

3 Requirements for Standards on Moving Features 

The requirements for standards on moving features are summarized below. 

1) “Schema for Moving Features (ISO19141, 2008)” should be referred to as the 
conceptual framework for this development. A standard data model should describe 
the movement of zero to three-dimensional geometric features including changes in 
attitude or rotation along with the movement. 

2) The implementation specifications on moving features should be prioritized, which 
more directly contributes to the system development because moving feature data is 
becoming more popular with the very rapid growth of smart phone users worldwide, 
and this is strongly pushing system developers towards the integration of moving 
feature data rather than using the moving feature data from a single source. 
Implementation specifications on simple features could be a starting point. The scope 
of the standardization should be expanded incrementally through communication and 
discussions with system developers and potential users. 

3) Methods specific to moving feature data handling, such as the detection of collisions, 
could be standardized after data model development arrives at certain level of 
maturity, based on further analysis of the technology and market trends. 

4) Visualization and spatio-temporal interpolation of geometric features are already 
supported by popular standards such as X3D (http://www.web3d.org/x3d/). 
Unnecessary overlaps should be avoided, while popular standards should be referred 
to in developing a new specification on the moving features. 

4 Example Prospective Application using Standard on Moving Features 

 As an example of the prospective applications, i.e., simulation system for tsunami 
evacuation, this section describes an estimation system of tsunami damage partly 
implemented by the authors.  

 A tsunami is a very large wave generated by a sudden up-thrust or sinking of the sea bed 
in association with an undersea earthquake, and causes serious damage along the coastal 
regions. Huge tsunamis have recently caused serious damage in Sumatra, Indonesia in 
2004 and Tohoku, Japan in 2011 (Figure 4). In order to reduce the amount of damage 
from tsunamis, measures and policies are required, such as the construction of 
breakwaters, the designation of evacuation areas, and the provision of evacuation 
guidance. A simulation for tsunami evacuation is helpful for creating measures and 
formulating policies.

The simulation system for tsunami evacuation facilitates well-informed decision making 
for the appropriate allocation of tsunami evacuation buildings (figure 5) by integrating 
tsunami simulations and people flow or evacuation simulations. Tsunami simulations 
precisely estimate the flooding areas when a tsunami hits the coastal area based on the 
topography of the sea bed and land. The people flow or evacuation simulation estimates 
the location of individuals when earthquakes happen and computes the evacuation 
movements to the nearest tsunami evacuation building. The system computes how many 
people could successfully evacuate from a tsunami under different scenarios to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the evacuation guidance, tsunami warning services, location/capacity 
of tsunami evacuation buildings among others (Figure 6). The system requires the 
functionality of exchanging temporally-changing inundation area/depth and moving 
features in a three-dimensional space.

points are evacuating people, while the red ones are people who could not escape. The 
green squares are tsunami evacuation buildings. 

 

5 Next Steps 

The development will start by examining the relevant standards, i.e., ISO 19141 Schema 
of Moving Features (2008) and OGC Implementation Specifications on Simple Features. 
Development could be made by an existing SWG or by a new SWG. The next steps will 
be defined through discussions between the members and chairpersons of the SWGs who 
may be interested in this development.
