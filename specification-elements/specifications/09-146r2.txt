i. Preface 

This document specifies a GML coverage structure extending the definition of GML 3.2.1 
[07-036] in a compatible way.  

Main change over GML is the addition of one mandatory component, rangeType, to the 
Coverage definition of GML 3.2.1 to provide a concise description of the coverage range 
value definition. Further, handling of format encodings different from GML are established. 

This enhanced coverage type is used, for example, by the Web Coverage Service (WCS) 
Standard [1] version 2.0 and higher, but is independent from WCS service. This augmented 
coverage structure can serve a wide range of coverage application domains and service types, 
thereby contributing to harmonization and interoperability. 

ii. Terms and definitions 

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r9], 
which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of In-
ternational Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to 
indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

Introduction 

Coverages represent digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenom-
ena. OGC Abstract Topic 6 [OGC 07-011] – which is identical to ISO 19123 – defines an 
abstract model of coverages. This is concretized by the Geography Markup Language (GML) 
3.2 [07-036], an XML grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application 
schemas as well as the transport and storage of geographic information. 

However, the definition contained in GML 3.2 has turned out to not contain sufficient infor-
mation to describe coverage instances in a flexible, interoperable, and harmonized manner. 
To remedy this, the document on hand defines a GML Application Schema for coverages by 
applying the following enhancements to the GML 3.2 Coverage data type: 

 A mandatory element rangeType has been added to carry information about the 
range value data structure of a Coverage.  

 The property coverageFunction, which in GML 3.2 is associated with every sub-
type of Coverage, is moved up into AbstractCoverage in the coverage type hi-
erarchy of the standard on hand. This semantic-preserving modification does not im-
pact instance documents. 

 A metadata hook has been added which allows definition of application specific sup-
plementary information to be transported with a coverage. 

 The grid coverage types are subtypes of AbstractCoverage rather than being sub-
types of DiscreteCoverage as in GML 3.2.  

Further, additional coverage format encodings beyond GML are established. 

This is a strict extension: no existing part of the GML 3.2 Coverage is changed in its syn-
tax, nor in its semantics.

1 Scope 

This document specifies the GML coverage structure to be used by OGC standards. 

2 Conformance 

Standardisation target of this document are concrete coverage instance documents, as gen-
erated by some service and/or consumed by some client.  

This document establishes four requirements classes: 

 gml-coverage, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/gml-coverage, 
with a single pertaining conformance class, gml-coverage, of URI  
http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/conf/gml-coverage. This conformance 
class is abstract. 

 gml, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/gml, with a single per-
taining conformance class, gml, of URI 
http://www.open¬gis.net/spec/GML¬COV/1.0/conf/gml.  

 multipart, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/multipart, with a 
single pertaining conformance class, multipart, of URI 
http://www.open¬gis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/conf/multipart. 

 special-format, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/special-
format with a single pertaining conformance class, special-format, of URI 
http://www.open¬gis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/conf/special-format. 

Any implementation claiming conformance with this GMLCOV standard must conform to 
the abstract conformance class gml-coverage and, in addition, at least one of the concrete 
conformance classes gml, multipart, and special-format. 

Requirements and conformance test URIs defined in this document are relative to

4 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in the above references 
apply. In addition, the following terms and definitions apply. 



OGC 09-146r2 

3 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

4.1 coverage ……. 

feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its 
spatiotemporal domain [OGC 07-011] 

4.2 GML coverage ……. 

feature which is a subclass (specialization) of a Coverage as defined in the GML Applica-
tion Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r1] 

5 Conventions 

5.1 Use of term “coverage” 

The definition of “coverage” in Subclause 4.1 is the generic one provided by Abstract Topic 
6 [OGC 07-011]. The term “GML coverage” is coined to denote the concrete data structure 
defined in the document on hand, relying on GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] and SWE Common 
2.0 [OGC 08-094]. 

For the remainder of this document, “coverage” shall be understood as a shorthand for “GML 
coverage” unless explicitly stated otherwise. 

5.2 UML notation 

All the diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) static structure diagram, as described in Subclause 5.2 of OGC Web Ser-
vice Common [OGC 06-121r9]. Further, the following conventions hold: 

 UML elements having a package name of GML are those defined in the UML model 
of GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036]. 

 UML elements having a package name of “SWE Common” are those defined in the 
UML model of SWE Common 2.0 [OGC 08-094]. 

 UML elements not qualified with a package name are those defined in this Applica-
tion Schema. 

5.3 Namespace prefix conventions 

The namespace prefixes used in this document are not normative and are merely chosen for 
convenience; they may appear in examples without being formally declared, and have no 
semantic significance. The namespaces to which the prefixes correspond are normative, how-
ever.

6 Coverage Model 

This Clause specifies the changes over the GML 3.2.1 coverage model and the components 
adopted from the SWE Common data model. As such, Clause 6 establishes an abstract con-
formance class whereby “abstract” denotes that a concrete program must implement one of 
the concrete conformance classes in addition to claim conformance with this standard. 

NOTE Although this Clause 6 heavily makes use of GML, it does not prescribe that a coverage in-
stance document be encoded in GML. A GML encoding of such coverage structures is established in con-
formance class gml. 

6.1 Overview …….. 

In GML 3.2.1, all coverage types are derived from the abstract Coverage data type. This 
structure contains a domainSet describing the coverage’s domain and a rangeSet com-
ponent containing the range values (“pixels”, “voxels”) of the coverage. This Application 
Schema extends GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] class Coverage with two components, 
rangeType and metadata.  

 The rangeType element describes the coverage's range set data structure. A range 
value often consists of one or more fields (in remote sensing also referred to as bands 
or channels), however, much more general definitions are possible. Range value 
structure description is based on the SWE Common [OGC 08-094] DataRecord. 

 The abstract coverage definition is augmented with an extensible slot for metadata. 
The intended use is to define concrete metadata structures and their semantics in ex-
tensions or application profiles. 

The following changes apply over the GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] specification: 

 The property coverageFunction, which in GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] is associat-
ed with every subtype of Coverage, is moved up into Coverage in the coverage 
type hierarchy of the standard on hand. 

NOTE This way, the coverage function is available in any subtype of Coverage. This 
serves to prepare for continuous coverages, like in the case described next. 

 The grid coverage types are subtypes of Coverage rather than being subtypes of 
DiscreteCoverage as in GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036].  



OGC 09-146r2 

5 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

NOTE This allows representing not only discrete grid coverages, but also continuous coverag-
es by using grids for the reference points in conjunction with a coverage function defining interpo-
lation. 

No further changes over GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] are made in this document. In particular, 
no pre-existing component changes its semantics. 

 

Figure 1: The Coverage structure 

For the standard on hand, Coverage shall always refer to the definition of this Application 
Schema and not to the GML definition of the same name, unless explicitly stated otherwise. 

Figure 1 shows the UML diagram pertaining to this Application Schema. 

Requirement 1 /req/gml-coverage/structural-adherence: 
Any XML document instantiating a concrete subtype of Coverage shall conform with the 
UML diagram in Figure 1, with Table 2, and with the XML schema defined as part of this 
standard.

NOTE 1 The optional element gml:Envelope serves to establish a bounding box of the coverage on 
hand. For a purely spatial coverage, gml:Envelope is appropriate. In case the coverage also has a 
spatial axis, gml:Envelope can be substituted by a gml:EnvelopeWithTimePeriod; in case 
of a purely temporal coverage, spatial dimension in gml:EnvelopeWithTimePeriod will be zero. 

NOTE 2 UML data type Any is used here with the same meaning as XML’s xsd:any, which does 
not have a direct equivalent in UML. 

NOTE 3 Following the GML pattern described in [OGC 07-036], on GML level SWE:: Data-
Record is linked to rangeType via an association SWE::DataRecordPropertyType. 

6.2 CoverageFunction 

The coverageFunction component is identical in its syntax and meaning to the coverage-
Function element defined in GML [OGC 07-036] Subclause 19.3.11. 

6.3 Metadata 

The metaData component is a carrier for any kind of application dependent metadata. 
Hence, no requirements are imposed here. 

6.4 RangeType 

The rangeType component adds a structure description and technical metadata required for 
an appropriate (however, application independent) understanding of a coverage. For this 
structure description, the SWE Common DataRecord is used. 

Requirement 2 /req/gml-coverage/dataRecord: 
The range type component of a coverage shall conform with the DataRecord of SWE 
Common [OGC 08-094]. 
Dependency: [OGC 08-094] Clause 7 (http://www.opengis.net/doc/SWE/2.0/clause/7), 
[OGC 08-094] Clause 8 (http://www.opengis.net/doc/SWE/2.0/clause/8), 

NOTE Following GML patterns the swe:DataRecord is linked into gmlwcs:Abstract-
CoverageType via swe:DataRecordPropertyType. 



OGC 09-146r2

Atomic data types available for range values are those given by the SWE Common data type 
AbstractSimpleComponent. As a range structure contains only structure definitions, but 
not the values themselves (these sit in the coverage range set component), the optional 
AbstractSimpleComponent component value is suppressed in coverages. 

Requirement 3 /req/gml-coverage/no-value-in-rangeType: 
For all SWE Common AbstractSimpleComponent subtypes in a range type structure, 
instance multiplicity of the value component shall be zero. 

NOTE Following [OGC 08-094], omission of the value component implies that in a DataArray 
there is no encoding component either. 

Range values can be structured as records or arrays. Both structuring principles can be nested 
(and mixed) to any depth for a concrete coverage range structure definition. 

Requirement 4 /req/gml-coverage/record-or-dataArray: 
Wherever the SWE Common XML schema allows an AbstractDataComponent in a cov-
erage range structure the concrete instance shall be one of the AbstractDataComponent 
subtypes DataRecord and DataArray. 

NOTE In particular, these AbstractDataComponent subtypes are not allowed in range struc-
tures: DataChoice, Vector, Matrix. 

Within a DataRecord contained in a concrete range structure, each of its record compo-
nents is locally uniquely identified by the record component’s field attribute, in accordance 
with the “soft-typing” property introduced by SWE Common. 

Example The following XML fragment represents a valid range structure; it models the red, green, and 
blue channel of a Landsat scene. Pixels are defined as unsigned 8-bit quantities where 0 and 255 denote 
null values:

6.5 RangeSet coherence 

Both domainSet and rangeType describe the coverage values given in the rangeSet. 
Hence, consistency must be enforced between them. The pertaining requirements are listed in 
this Subclause. 

Requirement 5 /req/gml-coverage/one-range-value-per-position: 
For each coordinate position contained in the domain set description of a coverage there shall 
exist exactly one range value in the coverage’s range set. 

NOTE Both duplicates and values omitted are not allowed. For range values not known for some rea-
son nil values can be used. 

Requirement 6 /req/gml-coverage/range-structure-consistency: 
All range values contained in the range set of a coverage shall be consistent with the 
structure description provided in its range type. 

6.6 Specific coverage types 

This standard supports all coverage types which GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] supports, which 
implement the discrete coverage types defined in ISO 19123 (listed in parenthesis). The sup-
ported types are substitutable from Coverage and include: 

 MultiPointCoverage (ISO 19123: CV_DiscretePointCoverage) 

 MultiCurveCoverage (ISO 19123: CV_DiscreteCurveCoverage) 

 MultiSurfaceCoverage (ISO 19123: CV_DiscreteSurfaceCoverage) 



OGC 09-146r2 

9 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 MultiSolidCoverage (ISO 19123: CV_DiscreteSolidCoverage) 

 GridCoverage (ISO 19123: CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage) 

 RectifiedGridCoverage (ISO 19123: CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage) 

 ReferenceableGridCoverage (added to GML via Change Request [OGC 07-
112r3]) 

The above coverage types may be used as is, or new coverage types may be constructed by 
using or deriving from one of the subtypes of Coverage or one of its subtypes. 

Requirement 7 /req/gml-coverage/coverage-derivation: 
The type of the root element of a coverage document instance shall be a concrete direct or 
indirect subtype of Coverage. 

Figure 2 shows the UML diagram of the coverage hierarchy. 

NOTE As in GML, continuous coverages are not currently supported. Consequently, Contin-
uousCoverage does not have any concrete subtype. 

6.6.1 DiscreteCoverage 

The domain set of a discrete coverage consists of either spatial or temporal geometry objects, 
finite in number. The range set is comprised of a finite number of attribute values each of 
which is associated to every direct position within any single spatiotemporal object in the 
domain. In other words, the range values are constant on each spatiotemporal object in the 
domain. This coverage function maps each element from the coverage domain to an element 
in its range. 

This class serves as the head of a specialization hierarchy which contains MultiPointCov-
erage, MultiCurveCoverage, MultiSurfaceCoverage, and MultiSolidCov-
erage. 

NOTE In GML 3.2.1 [OGC 07-036] grid coverages are contained in this class hierarchy as well based 
on a distinction between discrete and continuous coverages which is not considered state of the art any 
more. This Application Schema changes the hierarchy in that coverages are put separately, allowing to 
model continuous grid coverages.

Figure 2: The Coverage type hierarchy 

6.6.2 ContinuousCoverage 

A continuous coverage as defined in ISO 19123 is a coverage that can return different values 
for the same feature attribute at different direct positions within a single spatiotemporal ob-
ject in its spatiotemporal domain. The base type for continuous coverages is Continuous-
Coverage. 

Abstract class ContinuousCoverage serves as the head of a substitution group which may 
contain any continuous coverage whose type is derived from ContinuousCoverage. It 
parallels GML::ContinuousCoverage, except that the coverageFunction element 
has been moved "up" into Coverage. 

NOTE This GML handling of continuous coverages is under reconsideration, therefore use of Cont-
inuousCoverage is not encouraged. The various grid coverage types (see Subclause 6.6.7ff) allow 
already modelling certain types of continuous coverages. 

6.6.3 MultiPointCoverage 

In a MultiPointCoverage the domain set is a GM_MultiPoint, that is a collection of 
arbitrarily distributed geometric points. 

Requirement 8 /req/gml-coverage/multiPointCoverage: 
A coverage of type MultiPointCoverage shall have a content model identical with Dis-
creteCoverage, except that the domainSet shall have GML::MultiPoint values. 



OGC 09-146r2 

11 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

In the GML representation of a MultiPointCoverage the mapping from the domain to 
the range is straightforward: 

 For gml:DataBlock encodings the points of the gmlcov:MultiPoint are 
mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block. 

 For gml:CompositeValue encodings the points of the gmlcov:MultiPoint 
are mapped to the members of the composite value in document order. 

 For gml:File encodings the points of the gmlcov:MultiPoint are mapped to 
the records of the file in sequential order. 

6.6.4 MultiCurveCoverage 

In a MultiCurveCoverage the domain is partitioned into a collection of curves compris-
ing a GM_MultiCurve.  The coverage function then maps each curve in the collection to a 
value in the range set.  

Requirement 9 /req/gml-coverage/multiCurveCoverage: 
A coverage of type MultiCurveCoverage shall have a content model identical with Dis-
creteCoverage, except that the domainSet shall have “GML 3.2”::MultiCurve 
values. 

In the GML representation of a MultiCurveCoverage the mapping from the domain to 
the range is straightforward: 

 For gml:DataBlock encodings the curves of the gmlcov:MultiCurve are 
mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block. 

 For gml:CompositeValue encodings the curves of the gmlcov:MultiCurve 
are mapped to the members of the composite value in document order. 

 For gml:File encodings the curves of the gmlcov:MultiCurve are mapped to 
the records of the file in sequential order. 

6.6.5 MultiSurfaceCoverage 

In a MultiSurfaceCoverage the domain is partitioned into a collection of surfaces com-
prising a GM_MultiSurface.  The coverage function maps each surface in the collection to 
a value in the range set.  

Requirement 10 /req/gml-coverage/multiSurfaceCoverage: 
A coverage of type MultiSurfaceCoverage shall have a content model identical with 
DiscreteCoverage, except that the domainSet shall have GML::MultiSurface 
values. 

In the GML representation of a MultiSurfaceCoverage the mapping from the domain to 
the range is straightforward: 



OGC 09-146r2 

12 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 For gml:DataBlock encodings the surfaces of the gmlcov:MultiSurface are 
mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block. 

 For gml:CompositeValue encodings the surfaces of the gmlcov:MultiSur-
face are mapped to the members of the composite value in document order. 

 For gml:File encodings the surfaces of the gmlcov:MultiSurface are mapped 
to the records of the file in sequential order. 

6.6.6 MultiSolidCoverage 

In a MultiSolidCoverage the domain is partitioned into a collection of solids comprising 
a GM_MultiSolid.  The coverage function then maps each solid in the collection to a value 
in the range set.  

Requirement 11 /req/gml-coverage/multiSolidCoverage: 
A coverage of type MultiSolidCoverage shall have a content model identical with 
DiscreteCoverage, except that the domainSet shall have GML::MultiSolid values. 

In the GML representation of a MultiSolidCoverage the mapping from the domain to 
the range is straightforward: 

 For gml:DataBlock encodings the solids of the gmlcov:MultiSolid are 
mapped in document order to the tuples of the data block. 

 For gml:CompositeValue encodings the solids of the gmlcov:MultiSolid are 
mapped to the members of the composite value in document order. 

 For gml:File encodings the solids of the gmlcov:MultiSolid are mapped to 
the records of the file in sequential order. 

6.6.7 GridCoverage 

A GridCoverage is a discrete point coverage in which the domain is a geometric grid of 
points encoded using gml:Grid (not its subtypes gml:RectifiedGrid or a subtype of 
AbstractReferenceableGrid). Note that this is similar to the MultiPointCover-
age except that a gml:Grid shall be used to describe the domain. 

Requirement 12 /req/gml-coverage/gridCoverage: 
A coverage of type GridCoverage shall have a domain that is a GML::Grid. 

NOTE Such geometric positioning is introduced in the RectifiedGridCoverage. 

In order to address ambiguities in the gml:Grid definition, this GML Application Schema 
for Coverages imposes additional constraints on the use of a gml:Grid within a gmlcov: 
GridCoverage. (Specifically, there is no provision in the definition of gml:Grid defini-
tion to express the relationship between the grid positions and this geometry's coordinate 
reference system, which will always exist in some contexts, such as a Web Coverage Service. 
This coordinate reference system will be explicitly referenced in the srsName attribute of 



OGC 09-146r2 

13 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

the gml: SRSReferenceGroup of gml:Grid, or be inherited from an enclosing contain-
er element, such as the gml:Envelope of this gmlcov:GridCoverage.) Since provision 
for expressing a relationship does not exist, whenever used in gmlcov:GridCoverage, the 
relationship shall be simple. In this simple relationship, the dimension attribute of the 
gml:Grid shall be identical to the dimension of the geometry's coordinate system, the axes 
of the gml:Grid shall be identical to the axes of the geometry's coordinate system (which 
requires that the axisLabels be identical to those in the coordinate system definition), and 
the limits shall be treated as being expressed as coordinates in the geometry's coordinate ref-
erence system. 

Clearly these additional constraints are quite limiting, in that gridded datasets whose Refer-
ence points happen to exist exactly at integral coordinates of a spatial coordinate system at a 
spacing of exactly one in all coordinate dimensions are exceedingly rare, unless that coordi-
nate system is part of a gml:ImageCRS. Nevertheless, the gmlcov:GridCoverage is 
available for such purposes. 

It is recommended that the more sensible provisions of the gmlcov:RectifiedGridCov-
erage or gmlcov:ReferenceableGridCoverage be utilized for all gridded datasets, 
since their domains can accommodate the simple provisions of the 
gmlcov:GridCoverage as well as more complex referencing situations. 

Since this GridCoverage uses Coverage, it can be used for both discrete and continuous 
coverages. 

6.6.8 RectifiedGridCoverage 

A RectifiedGridCoverage is a discrete point coverage based on a rectified grid. It is 
similar to the grid coverage except that the points of the grid are geometrically referenced.  

Requirement 13 /req/gml-coverage/rectifiedGridCoverage: 
A coverage of type RectifiedGridCoverage shall have a domain that is a 
GML::RectifiedGrid geometry. 

Since this RectifiedGridCoverage uses Coverage, it can be used for both discrete and 
continuous coverages. 

6.6.9 ReferenceableGridCoverage 

A ReferenceableGridCoverage is an implementation of ISO 19123 DiscreteGrid-
PointCoverage for a ReferenceableGrid domain.  

Requirement 14 /req/gml-coverage/referenceableGridCoverage: 
A coverage of type ReferenceableGridCoverage shall have a domain geometry that is 
a subtype of AbstractReferenceableGrid.  

Since this ReferenceableGridCoverage uses the gmlcov:AbstractCoverage-
Type, it can be used for both discrete and continuous coverages. 

NOTE The equivalent of this element has been added to GML 3.2.1 by approved Change Request 07-
112r3 and, therefore, has been added to this standard as well.

7 GML representation requirements class 

Requirements class gml-coverage establishes how coverages are represented in the GML 
encoding format. Its identifying URL is given by 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/gml-coverage. 

NOTE Clause 6 establishes a conceptual model of a coverage, independent form its encoding. While 
UML and GML are used for establishing this, Clause 6 does not anticipate a GML encoding. A GML rep-
resentation is established by this Clause 7 instead. 

Requirement 15 /req/gml/coverage: 
In a coverage encoded in GML, the coverage structure represented shall conform with 
conformance class gml-coverage. 
Dependency: http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/gml-coverage. 

Requirement 16 /req/gml/content-type: 
In a coverage encoded in GML, the IETF RFC 2387 Content-Type parameter of this 
coverage document shall have a value of “application/gml+xml”. 

Requirement 17 /req/gml/special-format: 
A coverage document shall be conformant with OCG GML [07-036] conformance class 
A.1.9. 
Dependency: OCG GML [07-036] conformance class A.1.9.

8 Multipart representation requirements class 

8.1 Coverages as multipart messages 

A coverage can be represented as a multipart/related message document [4] consisting of a 
GML-encoded part containing the coverage data minus its range set followed by a second 
part containing an encoding of the coverage range set in some standard encoding format. This 
establishes requirements class multipart. Its identifying URL is given by 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/multipart. 

NOTE This encoding type describes a self-contained coverage document. The gml-coverage conform-
ance class, as per GML specification, additionally allows a remote URL to be used for referencing coverage 
constituents. The difference between both encodings is that coverages conforming to gml-coverage are a 
single GML document containing references to any other place, resolvable by the reader in any context, 
whereas a multipart coverage contains all constituents as sub-documents in the file itself. 

Requirement 18 /req/multipart/coverage: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, the coverage structure represented shall 
conform with conformance class gml-coverage. 
Dependency: http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/gml-coverage. 

Requirement 19 /req/multipart/multipart-mime: 
A coverage encoded in a multipart message shall consist of a multipart MIME document as 
specified by IETF RFC 2387 [4]. 

Requirement 20 /req/multipart/content-type: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, the IETF RFC 2387 Content-Type 
parameter of this coverage document shall have a value of “Multipart/Related”. 

Requirement 21 /req/multipart/number-of-components: 
A coverage encoded in a multipart message shall consist of two parts. 

Requirement 22 /req/multipart/start: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, the IETF RFC 2387 [4] Type parameter of 
this coverage document shall have a value of “application/gml+xml”. 

8.2 First part: GML coverage 

Requirement 23 /req/multipart/gml-coverage: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, the first part shall consist of a GML document 
of type gmlcov:AbstractCoverageType. 

Requirement 24 /req/multipart/use-file: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, in the first part the /gmlcov:Abstract-
Coverage/gml:rangeSet element shall contain a gml:File element. 

Requirement 25 /req/multipart/rangeParameters-role: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, in the first part the /gmlcov:Abstract-
Coverage/gml:rangeSet/gml:File/gml:rangeParameters/@xlink:role 
attribute shall contain the URL identifier of a conformance class of an OGC data encoding 
standard. 



OGC 09-146r2 

17 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Requirement 26 /req/multipart/rangeParameters-arcrole: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, in the first part the /gmlcov:Abstract-
Coverage/gml:rangeSet/gml:File/gml:rangeParameters/@xlink:arcrole 
attribute shall contain the value “fileReference”.

9 Special format requirements class 

Requirements class special-format establishes how coverages are represented in encoding 
formats other than GML. Its identifying URL is given by 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/special-format. 

NOTE Such formats may be able to encode only parts of a coverage, and they may be able to encode 
only specific categories of coverages. 

Requirement 34 /req/special/coverage: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, the coverage structure represented shall 
conform with conformance class gml-coverage. 
Dependency: http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/req/gml-coverage. 

Requirement 35 /req/special/special-format: 
A coverage document not encoded in GML shall be conformant with some OGC data format 
encoding standard. 
Dependency: OCG format encoding standards. 

Example A 2-D rectified grid coverage can be represented by a GeoTIFF file.

Annex A 
(normative) 

 
Abstract test suite 

This Annex specifies an Abstract Test Suite which shall be passed in completeness by any 
implementation claiming conformance with this Application Schema.  

Tests identifiers below are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/. 

A.1 Conformance Test Class: gml-coverage 

The OGC URI identifier of this conformance class is: 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/GMLCOV/1.0/conf/gml-coverage.  

A.1.1 Document validates 

Test id: /conf/gml-coverage/structural-adherence 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/gml-coverage/structural-adherence: 
Any XML document instantiating a concrete subtype of Coverage shall 
conform with the UML diagram in Figure 1, with Table 2, and with the 
XML schema defined as part of this standard. 

Test method: If the coverage instance document is encoded in XML, load the document 
into an XML validator. Test passes if the document is a valid concrete sub-
type of gmlcov:AbstractCoverageType. 

 

A.1.2 DataRecord range structure 

Test id: /conf/gml-coverage/dataRecord 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/gml-coverage/dataRecord: 
The range type component of a coverage shall conform with the Data-
Record of SWE Common [OGC 08-094].

A.1.3 No value component in rangeType 

Test id: /conf/gml-coverage/no-value-in-rangeType 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/gml-coverage/no-value-in-rangeType: 
For all SWE Common AbstractSimpleComponent subtypes in a range 
type structure, instance multiplicity of the value component shall be zero. 

Test method: In the instance document under test, inspect all SWE Common 
AbstractSimpleComponent subtypes in a range type structure and 
check that no value component is present.  

One way of doing so is to evaluate this Schematron rule: 

<sch:rule context="//swe:Quantity | 
//swe:QuantityRange |//swe:Count|//swe:CountRange | 
//swe:Time | //swe:TimeRange | //swe:Boolean | 
//swe:Category | //swe:CategoryRange | //swe:Text"> 
<sch:assert test="count(//swe:value)=0"/> 
</sch:rule> 

Test passes if constraint holds. 

A.1.4 Admissible DataRecord subtypes 

Test id: /conf/gml-coverage/record-or-dataArray 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/gml-coverage/record-or-dataArray: 
Wherever the SWE Common XML schema allows an AbstractData-
Component in a coverage range structure the concrete instance shall be one 
of the AbstractDataComponent subtypes DataRecord and 
DataArray. 

Test method: Inspect the instance document under test and check the above constraint. 
One way of doing so is to evaluate this Schematron rule: 

<sch:rule> 
<sch:assert test="descendant-or-self::* 
    [name()='swe:DataRecord' or  
     name()='swe:DataArray']" 
/> 
</sch:rule> 

Test passes if constraint holds.

to the second part of the multipart message.. 

Test method: If the coverage under test is encoded in a multipart message, check that its 
/gmlcov:AbstractCoverage/gml:rangeSet/gml:File/gml: 
fileReference element of the first part contains a local "cid" (Content-
ID) URL as specified by IETF RFC 2392 to access the second part of the 
multipart message. 

Test passes if constraint evaluates to true. 

A.1.29 Consistent mimeType 

Test id: /conf/multipart/mimeType 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/multipart/mimeType: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, in the first part the 
/gmlcov:AbstractCover-
age/gml:rangeSet/gml:File/gml:mimeType shall contain that 
MIME type string which is defined in the standard referenced in the 
/gmlcov:AbstractCoverage/gml:range-
Set/gml:File/gml:rangeParameters/@xlink:role attribute. 

Test method: If the coverage under test is encoded in a multipart message, check that its 
/gmlcov:AbstractCoverage/gml:rangeSet/gml:File/gml: 
mimeType of the first part contains the MIME type string which is defined 
in the standard referenced in the /gmlcov:AbstractCoverage/gml: 
rangeSet/gml:File/gml:rangeParameters/@xlink:role at-
tribute. 

Test passes if constraint evaluates to true. 

A.1.30 Correct Content-Disposition 

Test id: /conf/multipart/target-content-disposition 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/multipart/target-content-disposition: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message, the IETF RFC 2387 [4] 
Content-Disposition parameter of this coverage document shall be 
present and have a value of “inline” (not case sensitive). 

Test method: If the coverage under test is encoded in a multipart message, check that its 
IETF RFC 2387 Content-Disposition parameter of the first part pre-
sents and has a value of “inline” (not case sensitive). 

Test passes if constraint evaluates to true.

A.1.31 Consistent target mimeType 

Test id: /conf/multipart/target-mimeType 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/multipart/target-mimetype: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message the MIME type identifier of 
the second part shall be identical to the value of /gmlcov:Abstract-
Coverage/gml:rangeSet/gml:File/gml:mimeType in the first 
part of the multipart coverage. 

Test method: If the coverage is encoded in a multipart message, check that the Con-
tent-Type of the second part is identical to the value of 
/gmlcov:AbstractCoverage/gml:range-
Set/gml:File/gml:mimeType.  

Test passes if constraint evaluates to true. 

A.1.32 Consistent target encoding 

Test id: /conf/multipart/target-encoding 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/multipart/target-encoding: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message the second part shall conform 
to the encoding specified in the /gmlcov:AbstractCover-
age/gml:File/gml:rangeParameters/@xlink:role value in the 
first part of the multipart coverage. 

Test method: If the coverage under test is encoded in a multipart message, check that the 
Content-Transfer-Encoding of the second part conforms to the 
encoding specified in the /gmlcov:AbstractCoverage/gml:File/ 
gml:rangeParameters/@xlink:role value in the first part of the 
multipart coverage.  

Test passes if constraint evaluates to true. 

A.1.33 Consistent multipart coverage 

Test id: /conf/multipart/consistent 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/multipart/consistent: 
In a coverage encoded in a multipart message the coverage components en-
coded in the second message part, when decoded from the format on hand 
into GML, shall be consistent with the coverage components of the first part 
of the multipart coverage. 

Test method: If the coverage under test is encoded in a multipart message, decode the 
second message part of the multipart coverage into GML. Check that the 



OGC 09-146r2
