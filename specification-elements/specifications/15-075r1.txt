A Use-Case for Mobile Location Services with IndoorGML 
– Indoor Navigation for Visually Impaired People 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC® Discussion Paper describes a use-case of MLS (Mobile Location Services) to 
study how the OGC® IndoorGML standard can be applied to practical applications. In 
particular, the Paper focuses on an application of smart phones for guiding visually 
impaired people in indoor spaces with a voice-based navigation map implemented using 
IndoorGML. A prototype, called VIM (Voice-based Indoor navigation Map) is presented 
in this document. The prototype was developed on the Android OS for smart phones with 
the TalkBack1 function. Among mobile location services, it falls into the following 
classifications; 

 Transportation mode: pedestrian 
 Place type: indoor space (e.g. subway) 
 Type of services: navigation 
 Constraints: visually impaired

about voice-based indoor navigation maps for visually impaired people. In particular, we 
expect that the following considerations are to be taken for robust services; 

 Inter-level navigation: In this report, we did not consider the movement between 
levels in a building, such as via lifts or stairs. For more convenient and seamless 
service, features for inter-level navigations are required. 

 Integration of accurate indoor positioning technologies: Current indoor 
positioning methods do not support accuracy to the level that indoor pedestrians 
require for indoor navigation. This is the reason that the braille block networks 
have been used for an alternative for the prototype. However, we expect that 
sufficient accuracy can be provided in the near future and therefore we will be 
able to rely on the indoor positioning method. At that time a certain component 
of the data model of VIM (Voice-based Indoor navigation Map) should be 
modified accordingly. 

 Improved user-interface: VIM is the first version of prototype. Improvements to 
the user-interface with repeated field tests based on the feedbacks from real users 
are required.

4 Voice-based Indoor Navigation Maps  

Recent progress in mobile device and geospatial information technologies provides a 
platform for diverse navigation information services. In particular, car navigation and 
pedestrian navigation have become very popular as a smart phone application. These 
navigation and map services using smart phones are very useful for people with reduced 
mobility, including visually impaired people [4]. For example the BlindSquare service [1] 
provides pedestrian navigation services with smart phones for visually impaired people 
based on OpenStreetMap [9] data and iOS VoiceOver [10], which is a voice-based user-
interface.  

However, these services are mostly limited to outdoor space whereas most of our daily 
life is spent in indoor space. For this reason, we present a prototype of indoor route map 
service developed using TalkBack [8], which is voice-based user-interface in the Android 
OS. This prototype service, called VIM (Voice-based Indoor Map) assumes a braille 
block network of the indoor space, which is common in public indoor spaces in 
metropolitan cities such as subway stations.  

This Discussion Paper is organized as follows:  

 Clause 5: Briefly discuss the requirements of voice navigation indoor maps for 
visually impaired people.  

 Clause 6: The basic design concepts are described. 

 Clause 7: The data model used for the prototype is presented.  

 Clause 8: The prototype implementation is described. 

 Clause 9: Conclusion.

5 Requirements of Voice-based Indoor Navigation Map 

Unlike ordinary indoor navigation and map services, indoor map services for visually 
impaired people have specific requirements [7]. We considered these requirements as the 
starting point of design and implementation of our prototype. 
 

 Requirement 1 - providing environmental information: It is very important to 
provide environmental information to visually impaired users of the prototype so 
that they quickly recognize the environmental situations around them. While 
non-visually impaired people easily figure out the environment by a quick look 
around them, visually impaired people need explicit verbal information about the 
environment. Even though the environment may be irrelevant to the navigation, 
the user may have better understanding about the environment and feel more 
comfortable and safe with the environmental information. 

 Requirement 2 - separation of turning from walking: While non-visually 
impaired people do not separate turning and walking during movement, we need 
to provide turning and walking guide instructions in separate ways.  

 Requirement 3 - using smart phones: One of our goals is to provide indoor 
navigation maps without any additional equipment except smart phones. 
Therefore, the prototype should exploit the functions offered by smart phones. 

 Requirement 4 - braille block: Our prototype does not use any indoor positioning 
method due to accuracy problem. In order to replace indoor positioning methods, 
braille blocks are used as an alternative. In most metropolitan cities, braille block 
networks are provided in public places such as subway stations and they may 
serve as excellent guiding paths.  

 Requirement 5 - international standards: In order to provide VIM service, we 
need additional data sets such as indoor navigation networks and Points of 
Interests (POI). However, collecting such data sets covering an entire city would 
be very expensive and sharing these data set and interoperability between 
services become a critical issue. For this reason, we employ IndoorGML. 
IndoorGML defines a fundamental data model for indoor navigation network and 
easily be extended to meet the requirements of VIM service. 

6 Key Design Concepts for VIM 

In this section, we investigate how the requirements given in the previous section were 
considered in designing the prototype for the user-interface and data model.  

6.1 Braille Block Network 

In Seoul and other metropolitan cities in Korea, braille block networks are installed in 
public places and pedestrian roads to guide visually impaired people. The braille blocks 
are classified as stop block and walk block (Figure 1), which indicate a stop warning sign 
and walking straight sign respectively. Stop block must be installed at any location, 
where a stop is required for turning, intersections, or stop warning before important 
facilities or obstacles such as elevator, stairs, doors. By using these types of braille blocks, 
navigation network can be implemented as shown in figure 2.

Figure 1 — Braille Blocks: Stop (left) and Walk (right) 

 

 

Figure 2 — Braille Block Network 

 
Stop blocks and walk blocks are considered as nodes and edges of navigation network, 
respectively. Consequently a navigation network in indoor space is composed of nodes 
and edges defined by two types of braille blocks, where nodes and edges may contain 
additional attributes necessary for indoor maps of visually impaired people. Note that the 
navigational network is a directed graph since direction is an important property in 
navigation. 

6.2 Three Guiding Instructions – Walk, Stop, and Turn 

As discussed in Section 5, turning and walking should be clearly separated in guiding the 
navigation of visually impaired people for safety reasons. In particular, this distinction is 
very important in providing navigation instructions based on the braille network. The 
navigation instruction is classified into turn left, turn right, go straight, and stop. Turn 
left and turn right can be parameterized for the turning angle such as “turn right 45 
degrees” and go straight is given with a distance. For example, the navigation instructions 
for figure 3 are to be given as (1) go straight 4 meters, (2) stop and turn right 90 degrees, 
(3) go straight 4 meters. Note that “stop and turn right 90 degrees” can be simply merged 
into “turn right 90 degrees” since “stop” is required before every turn.

6.3 Landmark Information 

In order to inform the user of his/her environmental information as discussed in Section 5, 
Requirement 1, landmark information is also given in addition to navigation instructions. 
Landmarks includes POIs, obstacles, and other important features. When providing 
landmark information, we consider two aspects. First, the landmark information must be 
given early enough before arriving at the relevant position. Second the directional 
topology information from the current walking edge is also given to user. In figure 4, we 
assume that the user is walking through the edge e12 from node n1 to node n2, and object 
A, B, and C are landmarks. Then the landmark information of object A is given as “Object 
A is at the right side on the path”, ”Object B is at the left side on the path”, and “Object C 
is at the left side over the path”. The directional topology of landmark from the current 
edge is classified into the following categories; 

 
 case 1: left side on the path, 
 case 2: right side on the path, 
 case 3: left side over the path, and 
 case 4: right side over the path

6.4 Landmark Information 

We used IndoorGML to provide a framework for the indoor navigation network, which is 
a fundamental requirement of our prototype. IndoorGML properly supports the braille 
network and extensions required by VIM service. From this data model, we defined an 
extension to represent the guiding instructions and landmarks.  

7 VIM Data Model 

In this section the data model for VIM is presented. The data model is defined as an 
extension of the IndoorGML Core module reflecting the design concepts that we 
investigated in Section 6. The UML diagram of the extension is shown in figure 5. 
 

 Edge-based Instruction: Navigation instructions may be associated with either 
nodes or edges in a navigation network. Since the movements of users are more 
properly reflected by edges than nodes, we assign the information about 
navigation instruction to edges. Each edge of the network contains information for 
voice instruction(s) for navigation and landmarks. Therefore, if a routing path 
between two positions in indoor space is found, we are given a sequence of edges 
(e1, e2, ..., ek), where each edge in the sequence contains proper voice navigation 
instructions and landmarks.  

 Directed Graph: Since voice navigation instructions should be given depending on 
the walking direction, the navigation network is defined as a directed graph. A 
single edge in braille block network is therefore split as shown in Figure 6. When 
making a navigation network, we need to pay attention on each intersection and 
turning node. For example in figure 6 we see that two turning actions happen at 
node n1, left turn from e2 to e1, and right turn from the opposite direction. As 
previously discussed, any navigation instruction on action should be associated 
with an edge and node n1 must be split into n11 and n12 and two edges e31 and e32 
with different directions being added as shown in Figure 6.

8 Implementation 

In order to validate our prototype, we applied the approach to a real subway station in 
Seoul. A part of the site map is briefly shown in Figure 7. Yellow lines and yellow small 
squares indicate walking blocks and stop blocks on a given route path, respectively. All 
databases for VIM service are downloaded from a central data server and locally stored 
on an Android smart phone  The prototype then runs as a standalone application once the 
databases are downloaded. The user-interface was developed using the Android 
TalkBack functions for visually impaired people. As other navigation or map services, 



OGC 15-075r1

VIM starts with specifying the site name, starting and destination points as shown in 
Figure 8. Then VIM provides a sequence of navigation guiding instructions for the 
routing path and user can listen to the instruction of each edge of the network as shown in 
Figure 9. It also allows users to repeat the instructions.

9 Conclusion 

In this paper, we presented a prototype and design concepts for a voice-based indoor 
navigation map service. In considering the requirements for indoor navigation for 
visually impaired people, a prototype called VIM (Voice-based Indoor Map) was 
developed. The main features of the prototypes are as follows; 

 indoor navigation using braille block networks 
 voice-based instruction by TalkBack of Android OS, and 
 data model extended from IndoorGML Core Module. 

VIM is only a first step toward an indoor navigation map service for visually impaired 
people and there are several working items for future work. First, an intensive experiment 
by real visually impaired people to discover weak points in the prototype and then 
determining what improvements are required. Second, when there is sufficient accuracy 
for the safety of users, incorporating indoor positioning techniques into our prototype. 
Third, we need to strengthen VIM for the case when the braille block networks are not 
complete. Due to several reasons, braille blocks are often removed and the networks are 
disconnected in certain cases.
