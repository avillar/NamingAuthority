i. Preface 

 

This document contains the specification for the patented PDF geo-registration technique 
pioneered by TerraGo Technologies1. The intent of this specification is to codify existing 
practice and to insure that there is an official, stable best practice instance of PDF geo-
registration that documents the format used in millions of existing GeoPDF® files (legacy 
protection). The intent is NOT to make this specification an OGC standard. Further, a 
Best Practice should not even be referred to as a standard. Any future work on PDF geo-
registration in the OGC will be harmonized with the OGC and ISO standards baseline. 

An OGC Best Practice is defined as: 

"A best practice is a technique or methodology that, through experience and research, has 
proven to reliably lead to a desired result. A commitment to using the best practices in 
any field is a commitment to using all the knowledge and technology at one's disposal to 
ensure success."2 

This document is not intended to contain an explanation of the mathematical formulas 
that a developer might need to implement software that is capable of performing 
coordinate system transformations.  

Comments were received during the OGC review and voting process document that PDF 
geo-registration 2.2 is not completely aligned with the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 
2 (ISO 19101) – Spatial Referencing By Coordinates. This means that PDF geo-
registration 2.2 is not harmonized with the OGC Standards Baseline. However, PDF geo-
registration 2.2 documents an existing, widely used storage format. Changing how CRS 
is specified would “break” compatibility of this document and the actual storage format 
and metadata in the existing PDF geo-registration 2.2. Future work activities for PDF 
geo-registration do include harmonization with the OGC Baseline. 

Finally, the OGC recognizes that the specification of the datum, ellipsoid, and CRS codes 
as used in this document do not conform to the EPSG database, the current de-facto 
normative reference for CRS metadata. As this BP documents current existing practice, 
harmonizing with the EPSG codes is viewed as future work.

Introduction 

The  PDF geo-registration encoding specified by this document is an extension to the 
Adobe® Portable Document Format, as described in PDF Reference (see the Bibliography). 
PDF geo-registration 2.2 allows association of an arbitrary coordinate reference system to a 
PDF illustration. Supporting software can then perform bidirectional coordinate conversions 
between the coordinate reference system and the PDF coordinate system. 

These illustrations are frequently maps, representations of an area on the surface of the earth. 
Maps are frequently constructed to be more than aesthetically pleasing. They are made to 
allow tasks such as retrieving coordinates or compass bearings and measuring distances or 
areas. However, because a map is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional 
sphere – surface of the earth – there is inherent distortion in making a map. There is also the 
problem that the earth is not a perfect sphere. To be useful for such tasks the map must be 
created so as to minimize distortion and make what distortion cannot be avoided 
predictable. There is both art and science to this. The science is composed of standardized 
mathematical methods, map projections, and idealized models of the earth, ellipsoidal coordinate 
system. A map projection is a mechanism for rigorously converting from an ellipsoidal 
coordinate system to a two-dimensional plane, or projected coordinate reference system. 
Every map projection’s preservations and distortions make it more useful for some tasks and 
less for others. For each coordinate reference system, a datum is selected that best aligns 
with the portion of the earth’s surface to be mapped. To learn more, see Map Projections – A 
Working Manual (in the Bibliography). 
To fully support maps, PDF geo-registration 2.2 provides for up to three coordinate 
systems.  These will generally be referred to as: PDF, projected and geodetic. The geodetic 
coordinate system is a fully defined ellipsoidal coordinate system based on the geodetic 
datum used to create the map. Coordinate tuples for the geodetic system are commonly 
expressed as geodetic longitude and latitude. The projected coordinate system is a complete 
projected coordinate reference system derived from the PDF geo-registration 2.2's two-
dimensional geodetic coordinate reference system by the application of a fully defined map 
projection. The coordinate tuples for this reference system may be expressed in any linear 
unit, but common units are feet, meters, miles and kilometers. The PDF coordinate system is 
the result of scaling, translating and rotating the projected coordinate tuples to make them fit 
on a reasonably sized PDF page in a desired orientation. The native PDF unit is points. PDF 
georegistration 2.2 preserves enough information so that software can freely translate 
between all three.

GeoPDF Encoding Best Practice 

1 Scope 

The intended audience of this document is a developer of software for creating and 
consuming geo=registered PDF documents that conform to PDF geo-registration 2.2. It 
specifies how to create the necessary PDF objects that identify a region of the PDF page as a 
map and describe the map’s coordinate systems. Map creation and rendering to a PDF page 
are not addressed. The underlying PDF file format is not addressed. The file format is 
specified in PDF Reference[1] . 
The reader will need knowledge of PDF objects and document structure. An understanding 
of cartographic projections and datums will also be helpful. Information about these can be 
found in Map Projections – A Working Manual[2] . 
Though written with the PDF 1.7 file format in mind, this Best Practice is believed to be 
valid for all versions of the PDF file specification prior to PDF 1.7.

6 Overview 

Conceptually, PDF geo-registration 2.2 specifies map frames associated with a PDF page. A 
minimal map frame describes a coordinate reference system that is associated with  the entire 
document page.  This association provides a collection of tuples that map the page (PDF) 
coordinate system to the known coordinate reference system. Optionally a neatline specifies 
the geometric region of the page that is associated with the foreign coordinate system. There 
may be multiple map frames on a given page. Map frames may overlap or be inset. The 
coordinate reference system of a map frame is independent of any other map frame. 

Map frames are associated with their parent PDF page object. Table 1 describes PDF geo-
registration 2.2 additions to the standard PDF page object. 

Table 1 details the entries the PDF geo-registration 2.2 Best Practice adds to a PDF page 
object. 

 

TABLE 1  PDF geo-registration 2.2 entries in a page object 

KEY TYPE VALUE 

LGIDict array or 
dictionary 

Required if there is one or more map frames associated with 
this page object. 

The value may be either a single map frame or an array of map 
frames. If an array, the order of map frames in the array is 
front to back (top to bottom). This may be significant if map 
frames overlap or are inset.

6.1 Map Frames 

The map frame describes the relationship between a  coordinate reference system and an 
area on the PDF page.  Three types of coordinate reference systems are supported:  
geodetic, projected and unregistered Cartesian (Engineering).  In each case, the coordinate 
reference system is transformed into the PDF coordinate system with a coordinate 
transformation matrix as discussed in section 4.2.3 of PDF Reference[1] .  The map frame 
contains PDF dictionary entries that describe the coordinate transformation matrix, all 
parameters required for a map projection (if used), the reference ellipsoid and geodetic 
datum.  More than one map frame may be present on a single PDF page.  

For simplicity, the map frame follows certain conventions. All angular values are in degrees. 
When angular coordinates are needed in a context where Cartesian x and y coordinate values 
would normally be expected, use the longitudinal values as x values and the latitudinal values 
as y values. 
Due to limitations in Acrobat® internal numeric representations, PDF geo-registration 2.2 
allows an alternate representation of numbers. Any number within a map frame may be 
expressed as a PDF string. The value of the string is a printed representation of the number. 
MAP2PDF® performs coordinate transformations using IEEE double-precision floating-
point numbers as described in IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic (see the 
Bibliography). Acrobat® 6, 7 and 8 use IEEE single-precision floating-point numbers. Earlier 
versions used a 32-bit fixed-point numbers. Use of string representation for projection 
parameter values and transformation matrix members is highly recommended. Numbers not 
expressed as a PDF string will be subject to the limitations of Acrobat numeric 
representations. 

Table 2 details the content of a map frame. 

 

TABLE 2  Entries in a map frame 

KEY TYPE VALUE 

Type name (Required)  The type of object that this dictionary describes; 
must be LGIDict for a map frame. 

Version string (Optional)  A string identifying the version of the PDF geo-
registration 2.2 Specification this map frame conforms to. For this 
Best Practice the value should be 2.1. 



OGC 08-139r3

CTM array (Required if registration points are not present)  The Coordinate 
Transformation Matrix mapping from the PDF coordinate 
system to the projected or geodetic coordinate system. 

A transformation matrix takes precedence over registration 
points when both are present. 

This array follows the same convention as the array parameter 
to the PDF coordinate transformation operator, cm, with the 
exception of allowing string representations. 

Registration array (Required if a transformation matrix  is not present)  A series of 
registration point pairs. 

A transformation matrix takes precedence over registration 
points when both are present. 

Each point pair is given as an array of four values: a PDF x 
value, a PDF y value, a map x value, and a map y value. 

Projection dictionary (Required if a geodetic or projected coordinate system)  A projection 
dictionary (see “Projection and Display Dictionaries,” below). 

Display dictionary (Optional) A display dictionary (see “Projection and Display 
Dictionaries,” below). 

Neatline array (Required if multiple map frames are present; otherwise optional)  A 
series of PDF points defining the boundary of the map frame, 
in clockwise order. 

The values in this array are interpreted as x and y values 
specifying PDF page points. The minimum number of points 
is two, which will be interpreted as a diagonal describing a 
rectangular bounding box. 

 

Note: If Projection is not present, the value is assumed to be NONE (see Appendix B). 

6.2 Projection and Display Dictionaries 

The projection dictionary describes the algorithm and parameters required to define the 
coordinate reference  system used in each map frame of the PDF geo-registration 2.2 
document. Each map projection algorithm has a series of required parameters (see 
Appendix B). The parameter values vary with the geographic center and possibly the 
range of the data to be projected. The geodetic datum and map projection parameters are 
preserved in the projection dictionary. Supported geodetic datums and their associated 
PDF geo-registration 2.2 codes are listed in Appendix A. Supported map projections and 
associated PDF geo-registration 2.2 codes are listed in Appendix B. Appendix B includes 
the parameters required by and notes pertinent to each projection.

Note: The PDF geo-registration 2.2 notion of projection is more general than the typical 
cartographic usage. It includes some grid systems, such as Universal Transverse 
Mercator, which combine a projection algorithm with a system of standardized 
projection parameters. 

 

Projection parameters are of a number of types. Most are either linear or angular. Linear 
values should always be expressed in meters, regardless of the native linear unit of the 
projection coordinate reference system. Angular values should always be given in 
degrees. Most angular values are either used in to define specific geodetic longitude or 
latitude values. Longitude values are relative to the Greenwich prime meridian, positive 
values being to the east and negative to the west. The supported range for longitudes is -
180° to 180°. Latitude values are relative to the equator, positive values being to the north 
and negative values to the south. The supported range is -90° to 90°. Latitude and 
longitude are typically represented in PDF geo-registration 2.2 as decimal degrees. 
However, PDF geo-registration 2.2 files have been created using degrees decimal-
minutes and degrees, minutes, and decimal-seconds. Consuming applications should be 
prepared to read such files. 

A display dictionary is used to specify the coordinate system a consuming application 
should use to display non-PDF coordinate reference values. 

Table 2 details the contents of a projection or display dictionary. 

TABLE 2  Entries in a projection or display dictionary 

KEY TYPE VALUE

dictionary 

(Optional)  The source geodetic coordinate 
system. 

This may be either a PDF geo-registration 2.2 
code for a predefined datum, or a custom datum 
definition.

6.3 Datum Definitions 

In addition to predefined geodetic datum codes, PDF geo-registration 2.2 supports custom 
geodetic datum definitions. A geodetic datum is comprised of an ellipsoid, a known origin 
point, and a prime meridian.  In the case of PDF geo-registration 2.2 documents, a 
Greenwich prime meridian is assumed.  Additionally, the dictionary description for a custom 
geodetic datum can contain  a shift, a mathematical operation that converts (at least 
approximately) the geodetic datum’s coordinates to the widely-used World Geodetic System 
1984 geodetic datum (WGS84). 

Table 3 details the contents of a custom datum definition. 

 

TABLE 3  Entries in a custom geodetic datum definition 

KEY TYPE VALUE 

Ellipsoid string or 
dictionary 

(Required)  An ellipsoid definition. 
The value may be an ellipsoid code (see Appendix C) 
or an ellipsoid definition. 

Description string (Optional)  A name assigned to this datum. 
ToWGS84 string or 

dictionary 
(Optional)  A shift from this datum to the WGS84 
datum. 

The value is either a shift code (see Appendix D) or a 
shift definition.

6.4 Ellipsoid Definitions 

An ellipsoid is a surface formed by the rotation of an ellipse about a main axis.  Along with a 
defined center point and prime meridian, it can be used as a model that approximates the 
surface of the earth. It is described by a semi-major axis and either a semi-minor axis or an inverse 
flattening. Table 4 details the contents of an ellipsoid definition. 
 

TABLE 4  Entries in a custom ellipsoid definition 

KEY TYPE VALUE 

SemiMajorAxis number (Required)  The length of the ellipsoid semi-major axis, 
i.e. the radius of the earth at its equator. 

InvFlattening number (Required if semi-minoraxis is not specified)  1/f, where f = 
(a-b)/a, and a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-
minor axis. 

SemiMinorAxis number (Required if inverse flattening is not specified)  The length of 
the ellipsoid semi-minor axis, i.e. half the distance 
from the north pole to the south pole. 

Description string (Optional)  A name assigned to this ellipsoid. 

6.5 Shift Definitions 

A shift definition specifies how to convert a map frames geodetic datum’s coordinate values 
to equivalent ellipsoidal coordinates on a WGS84 geodetic datum. Table 5 details the content 
of a shift definition. 

TABLE 5  Entries in a shift definition 

KEY TYPE VALUE 

dx number (Optional)  This specifies translation on x. 
dy number (Optional)  This specifies translation on y. 
dz number (Optional)  This specifies translation on z. 
rx number (Optional)  This specifies rotation around the x axis. 
ry number (Optional)  This specifies rotation around the y axis. 
rz number (Optional)  This specifies rotation around the z axis. 
sf number (Optional)  This specifies a scale factor. 
Description string (Optional)  A name assigned to this shift.
