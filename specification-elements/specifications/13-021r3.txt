i. Abstract 
This document describes an information model for exchanging rating tables, or rating 
curves, that are used for the conversion of related hydrological phenomenon. It also 
describes a model describing the observations that are used to develop such relationships, 
often referred to as gauging observations. 

The information model is proposed as a second part of the WaterML2.0 suite of 
standards, building on part 1 that addresses the exchange of time series1.  

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues.

1. Scope 

This document describes a preliminary information model to describe hydrological 
ratings and gaugings observations. Currently the information model does not cover river 
cross sections or related survey information -- this will be tackled in the continuing work. 
This document describes the UML information model only; the XML Schema is not 
covered at this stage. The intention of this discussion paper to elicit feedback from 
the community on the current model and direction of work.  

This work is being conducted by members of the joint WMO/OGC Hydrology Domain 
Working Group.

3. Terms and Definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is 
based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 
to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard. Section 10 is 
an informal documentation of requirements and does not conform to use of ‘shall’. This 
reflects the discussion paper nature of this document.  

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply. 

3.1 Conversion 

A conversion defines the relationship between two physical properties using an equation, 
x-y point table or other form. E.g. a stage-discharge conversion defined by a rating table.  

3.2 Conversion group 

A group of applicable periods that define conversions relating to a specific monitoring 
point and property combination (the parameter being converted from and the parameter 
being converted to).  

3.3 Conversion period 

A period of time for which a particular conversion is applied. Only one conversion is 
applicable at any one time.  

3.4 Gauging observation/gauging/conversion observation 

An observation performed to measure two related variables with the aim of defining their 
relationship using a rating curve and/or table.

an observation.  

[OGC 10-004r3/ISO 19156] 

3.9 Rating table/curve 

Any table showing the relation between two mutually dependent quantities or variables 
over a given range of magnitude, e.g., a table showing the relationship between the stage 
in a reservoir and its volume. (Source: http://www.bom.gov.au/water/awid/index.shtml) 

3.8 Sampling feature

4. Background 

WaterML2.0 is an initiative within the Hydrology Domain Working Group (HydroDWG) 



OGC  13-021r3  

 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 

to address standards development and interoperability of hydrological information 
systems at an international level. The first part of WaterML2.0 
(www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml) focused on a standard information model, 
and XML encoding, for time series of hydrological observations. The scope was defined 
by priority areas of members of the HydroDWG and through identification of common 
requirements. The development involved a harmonisation process whereby existing 
formats were compared and contrasted with an aim of capturing the key elements for time 
series data exchange. Early versions of the standard were tested through a number of 
OGC Interoperability Experiments, each resting against a different set of use cases.  

WaterML2.0 part 2 focuses on another key aspect of hydrological data: rating 
tables/curves, gauging observations and river cross-sections. These are part of almost all 
surface water monitoring programs and are used in daily operations, including reporting, 
analysis, modeling and forecasting. This type of data is becoming increasingly important 
to exchange and share outside the scope of single organisations, as the awareness and 
desire to analyse this type of data grows.  

 

 Key concepts 
Rating curves – which may also represented as tables – are mathematical relationships 
allowing conversion from a physical phenomena to an estimate of a related phenomena; 
the captured relationship represents an approximation of a physical relationship. The 
most commonly employed rating curves in hydrology are stage-discharge rating curves, 
which allow for estimates of the volumetric flow rate of water at a point in a river. Curves 
are developed from multiple observations – often termed gaugings – of stage and flow at 
a particular measuring location. The relationship is a complex one and many techniques 
exist for building up rating curves; from equipment used in the observation process to the 
methods of computation and conversion. The subtleties are not covered here, but the 
approaches used will have a varying degree of influence on the requirements for 
representation of a curve and/or table. The most common method for determining an 
estimated discharge measurement is the velocity-area method, roughly described in the 
following steps: 

 The velocity of water is measured in different segments of the river cross-section. 
 The volume for each segment is calculated based on the velocity using a selected 

method (arithmetical, graphical etc.) 
 Summation of the segments gives an estimate of total discharge.

The method used to determine the velocity at each point varies – more traditional 
techniques involve the use of a current meter attached to a propeller that is lowered into 
the river, sometimes from a boat or directly by an operator standing in the river.  
 
The use of acoustic methods, such those provided by Doppler instruments, are increasing 
in use due to their practicality and availability of commercial instruments. For example, 
an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) is attached to a boat that makes use of the 
Doppler effect to measure velocity of suspended particles in the river. It will 
simultaneously measure the depth and path of the vessel to calculate discharge. Multiple 
transects are taken by the boat to provide a more accurate measurement.  
 
Once a rating curve has been established it is an estimate of the stage-discharge 
relationship at a given place and time. The relationship is based on time discrete 
observations that represent the flow through the river cross-section in varying conditions. 
For natural channel controls, the cross-section of the river is often not static due to factors 
such as erosion, changes in vegetation, sediment build up, among others. Man-made 
control structures generally are not affected to the same extent by such physical process, 
but may still undergo change, or even removal. Thus rating curves often have an 
associated period of applicability: they need to be continually evolved as conditions 
change. Most river operations will regularly perform gaugings to keep rating 
relationships up to date.  
 
The exchange of rating curves may be done through definition of a table that represents 
the stage-discharge relationship or by definition of an (often polynomial) equation 
representing a fitted curve. Error! Reference source not found. shows an example plot 
of a rating curve (on a log-log scale) with the individual gauging points and rating period 
of application. WMO recommends a curve should “…include at least 12 to 15 
measurements, all made during the period of analysis” and these should be “…well 
distributed over the range of gauge heights experienced.”

5. Use cases/scenarios 

Sharing of rating curves is required in multiple scenarios, generally stemming from the 
need to perform the calculation of the derived phenomenon or to analyse the derived data 
with a view to understanding inherent uncertainty or quality. The following use cases 
were used in the requirements analysis process and produced a set of requirements that 
are described later in this document. 

 Data scrutiny 
A primary use case for exposing detailed descriptions of rating tables is for closer 
scrutiny of derived data sets. A number of regularly used hydrological time-series -- the 
most obvious being river discharge/flow --  are derived using techniques that are 
approximations for relationships between other more readily measurable phenomenon. It 
is becoming increasingly important for these data to be treated carefully due to the 
inherent assumptions made in the transformation process1. 

Four scenarios were used when analyzing requirements from this perspective: 

1. Uncertainty research.  

2. Geomorphic process, cross sections. 

3. Engineering design, e.g. designing a flood barrier.

4. Analysis and assessment of input data for hydrological models.  

 Exchange of specific rating table 
It is often desirable to have instant access to a specific rating table relationship for a 
specific purpose. Some indicative examples include: 

1. Time sensitive (floods, events, emergencies) 

2. Inundation modeling (reversing out the independent variable (e.g. stage)) 

3. A site visit or comparing a gauging point against the curve 

 Exchange of full rating history 
Often a centralised repository or reporting agency requires access to a full history of 
rating tables to run derived calculations for specific sites at any point in time. This 
requires a full history of rating tables as they have evolved through time. This would 
often exclude development versions of rating tables that have not been approved for use 
or release.  

 Suspended sediment and load calculations 
Sediment-transport relationships (for calculating concentration, loads etc.) are used in 
numerous scenarios requiring an understanding of expected sediment build up or effects 
on the general environment. These relationships are often required by hydraulic or civil 
engineers for particular analysis or case studies.  

 Transfer between disparate information systems 
This use case covers exchange between systems that do not have a common information 
model/schema for representation of rating tables. While this is a generic use case that 
may occur within the above scenarios, it is an important one for operation and 
interoperability of distributed information systems.  

 Research services 
General hydrological studies benefit from open access to hydrological data that may be 
used in educational scenarios, such as those provided by CUAHSI. Rating tables and 
gauging observations are fundamental concepts within hydrological operations and 
having access to real world data in common formats supports learning these base 
concepts.

6. Model description 

The following section provides details of the model developed thus far. This model is 
under development, but the core concepts and scope have largely been agreed on by 
members of the working group.  

The model section is followed by a list of requirements developed by the working group, 
based on analysis of the use cases and exchange scenarios.

7. Conversions overview 

 

 General overview 
Conversions are defined by the parameter (phenomenon - GF_PropertyType) they 
convert from and to, as well as their associated monitoring point. A conversion may be 
represented using a table or an equation, however a ConversionTable is the mandatory 
exchange target (this constraint is not shown in the model). 

A Conversion contains metadata relating to its current status, review lifecycle etc. A 
conversion may be related to its source definition (e.g. an expanded table may be related 
back to its original equation form), however the equations themselves are not defined in a 
machine readable form (a formal equation model won't be developed). 

A ConversionTable is composed of one or more tuples that define the independent and 
dependent variable values as quantities. The table is an expanded, linearly interpolated 
table. The granularity of the points is defined by the exporting system, but should be 
sufficient to re-use the table. 

The ability to link from the conversion to the gaugings that were used (or excluded) in 
development is available as associations from the conversion metadata type. 

A ConversionGroup describes one or more ConversionPeriods that also relate to a 
particular monitoring point and parameter combination. The ConversionGroup thus 
captures the logical grouping of conversion and applicable periods as they have been 
captured through time.

 Conversion 
A Conversion defines the relationship between two parameters: a parameter being 
converted from (the independent variable) and the parameter being converted to (the 
dependent variable). A conversion applies to a specific monitoring point.  
 
Often conversions are worked on in-line with internal data management policies. This 
work will generally involve edits to a conversion, sometimes generating different 
versions of a conversion for the same applicable period. In the US, these are sometimes 
represented as shifts to a particular version of a conversion. In this model, by convention, 
the most recent version of the conversion is the only version being communicated. If 
shifts are in use, the shift that is the most up to date should be applied to the conversion 
and the result is exchanged.  
 

sourceDefinition (0..1) 

This is an extension point to enable propriety systems to refer to an encoding of their 
systems definition of the conversion. 

This captures the requirement of RGS-07 to enable referring to original definition of the 
conversion, e.g. equation or logarithmic interpolated points table. The referenced 
information will be defined by individual usage.  

monitoringPoint (1) 

Association of the conversion with a 'WaterML 2.0: Part 1- Timeseries' monitoring point. 

applicableConversion (1) 

The applicable conversion for this period.  

metadata (0..1) 

Association of a conversion with the Metadata of the conversion.  

parameterFrom ( 1 ... 1) 

The parameter being converted from. E.g. river level/stage. 

parameterTo ( 1 ... 1) 

The parameter being converted to (i.e. target parameter of the conversion). E.g. stream 
flow/discharge. 

 ConversionEquation 
A conversion may be defined by an equation. The scope of the initial conversion 
development activity did not include the specification of equations. It is recognised that 
there is an interoperability need to include the use of a common method of encoding 



OGC  13-021r3

equations. It is modeled here as a requirement for future extensibility. 
The exact form of the equation is not defined here, but identified as a future option for 
encodings.  

 ConversionGroup 
A conversion group defines a logical grouping of conversion periods to capture the 
changing conversion relationship through time. This group may represent the full 
conversions for these parameters available at a site (see fullConversion attribute).  
The Conversion's direct connection to the monitoring point supports transfer of a single 
conversion. 
 
member (1..*) 

Captures the conversion period members of the group. Each period defines a period of 
application that makes up the group.  

rangeDefinitions (0..*) 

The available range value definitions for this conversion group (combination of 
parameterFrom/To and monitoring point).  

domainFeatureClass (0..1) 

The type of domain feature that this conversion group relates to. For example: river 
reach, reservoir etc. See HY Features models for examples of relevant feature types. This 
can be determined through the monitoringPoint relationship to the domain feature, but it 
is sometimes important to have the domain type available with the conversion definition.  

monitoringPoint (1) 

The monitoring point that was used as the gauging station.  

parameterFromDatum ( 0 ... 1) 

The vertical datum that is associated with the independent (parameter from) phenomenon.  

fullConversion ( 0 ... 1) 

Defines whether this group of conversion contains all the available conversions for a 
site-paramTo-paramFrom combination. This would be false, for example, if the group 
contains only the latest conversions.  

 ConversionMetadata 
Describes metadata relating to the conversion. Generally this related to conversion 
development processes (review, development method etc.).  
 

metadata (0..1)

A code that gives an indication of the method used to develop the conversion 
relationship. See DevelopmentMethodCode.

A code indicated the status of the conversion relating to its development lifecycle.  

versionIdentifier ( 0 ... 1) 

A version identifier for the conversion, if available. Only one conversionTable for a 
conversion period is published. The version identifier may be used to indicate the 
revision sequence number, identifier or text describing the current version. 

 ConversionPeriod 
A conversion period defines the time period in which a particular conversion relationship 
should be used. Conversion periods may re-use conversions for different periods (e.g. the 
physical relationship is changed for a period of time due to some installation and reverts 
to the previous conversion once this is removed).

member (1..*) 

Captures the conversion period members of the group. Each period defines a period of 
application that makes up the group.  

periodEnd ( 0 ... 1) 

The end of the conversion period. This is optional and is used to define a gap between 
conversion periods or a period of validity for the current conversion table. Normal usage 
would involve a succession of conversion periods defined by only periodStart dates. 

periodStart ( 1 ... 1) 

The start of the conversion period.  

phasedPeriod ( 0 ... 1) 

A change in applicable conversion table is controlled by adding records to the conversion 
period. The conversion period declares the table that is active and the date and time from 
which it is active. This means that there is an instantaneous switch from one conversion 
table to the next. 

A transition is a method to define the change between two different conversion tables 
over a period of time rather than instantaneously. Transitions are useful when the 
underlying physical change is a gradual one, for example with the accumulation of algae, 
ice or weeds; scouring and aggregation of river bed.  

The phasedPeriod property specifies the period over which the conversion should be 
phased from the preceding table to the current table. The phase period begins at 
conversionStart and ends after the duration of the phasedPeriod. There is a linear 
progression from the preceding table to the current table during the phasedPeriod.  

A phased change more closely reflects the underlying change in physical relationship. 

 ConversionTable 
A conversion table is the primary target for exchange of conversion relationships. It 
encodes the relationship of the parameter being converted from (independent variable) to 
the parameter being converted to through a table of tuples. This table shall be of 
sufficient resolution to allow linear interpolation between points.

 General overview 
Conversion observations, sometimes called gaugings, are the observations that are made 
to record the relationship between two parameters at a specific point in time, influenced 
by the environmental conditions. These observations are used to either build an empirical 
conversion relationship or to verify a theoretically produced relationship between the 
parameters. 

These observations are performed using wide array of methods, procedures and types of 
hardware. The focus of this model is to capture the x-y value that results from (potentially 
many) observations that are made to estimate the relationship between two variables. For 
example, to understand the stage-discharge relationship at a gauging station, many 
observations are made at different x-y-z locations within a watercourse. These results are 
generally used to calculate an aggregate a single stage-discharge estimate for the section 
of the river. 

 ConversionObservation 
Conversion observations are captured as a specialised type of the O&M concept of an 
Observation: 

 The feature of interest relates to the location at which the gauging observation has 
taken place or the gauging station; 

 The result is a measurement tuple that represents the value of the independent 
phenomenon (e.g. stage) and the dependent phenomenon (e.g. discharge).  

 The observed property groups the two phenomena together into a parameter pair. The 
alternative is to model the gauging as two separate measurement observations, one 
each for the independent and dependent phenomena. It is common practice however 
to combine the two together as this is the normal interpretation when related to 
estimation of the conversion relationship.  

 The process is captured with a type categorisation and extensible metadata properties. 
The variety of methods and metadata for gauging observations is extensive. 
Harmonisation of all the methods is not practical and would most likely rely on more 
fully standardised measurement methods.  

 A metadata type captures common metadata relating to the observation, such as 
influencing environmental conditions, status of the observational data etc.

9. RangeValues overview 

 

 General overview 
Range tables are a data structure that is similar to a conversion table except that the value 
applies across a broad input range and the content describes a state or condition that 
varies with the input range, rather than a conversion. Range tables may carry information 
that relates to, or adds value to, a conversion table. E.g. Information describing the rating 
construction method. A range table may carry information that is of value in it own right. 
E.g. Stage V. over bank flow condition (confined to channel, over bank flow). 

 RangeEntry 
A single entry within the range values definition. A categorisation that defines the range 
of parameterFrom values that are associated with a range value.  The parameterFrom 
start value is defied explicitly. The parameterFrom end value is defined by the lower of 
the next rangeCategory start value or the rangeDefinition endValue. 
 

value (1) 

The value of the range entry. This value holds until this next range entry start value.  

entry (1..*) 

An entry within the range table.  

startValue ( 1 ... 1) 

The value from which the range entry begins. Each entry holds until the next startValue,

The end of the range period. This is optional and is used to define a gap between range 
periods or a period of validity for the current range table. Normal usage would involve a 
succession of range periods defined by only periodStart dates.  

 RangeTable 
A RangeDefinition specifies metadata that is associated with a range of a quantity (e.g. 
from 2.3 to 3.5). For Conversions, this will most often relate to the independent variable 
(e.g. metadata for stage between 2.3 and 3.5 meters.). Ranges are specified by the start 
value and hold until the next range entry. The upper end of applicability is specified by 
the endValue attribute.

range (1..*) 

The range definition for this period of application.  

endValue ( 1 ... 1)

The value at which the range entries end. Only the final end value is specified -- each 
range point holds from its start value until the next value, or if it is the last entry to the 
endValue. 

 

10. Informal Requirements 

This section provides a listing of the core requirements for the RGS model. These were 
developed through the working groups' workshops and teleconferences.  

Requirement: rgs-1 

Description: Generalised conversion relationships are implemented rather than 
Stage/Flow only relationships. This enable relationships between user specified 
parameters to be defined. 

Requirement: rgs-10 

Description: Ratings are keyed to a Site / Point / ParameterFrom / ParameterTo. 

Requirement: rgs-11 

Description: When defining stage as a parameter for a conversion, the stage datum must 
be supplied. 

Requirement: rgs-12 



OGC  13-021r3  

 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Description: Scope decision : The ratings being communicated are the 'Active ratings'. 
The ratings that would be applied to determine ParameterTo value. It will have been shift 
corrected and will be the active rating at the time. Return should indicate the date and 
time for wich the data applied 

Requirement: rgs-13 

Description: The use of conversion transitions / phased change is in scope 

Requirement: rgs-14 

Description: The use of start dates for a conversions period is agreed. 

Requirement: rgs-15 

Description: The use of end dates for a conversions period is agreed. The end dates is 
purely used for describing a gap. Rating gap  periods can be implemented by end dates a 
or a null rating. 

Requirement: rgs-16 

Description: Rating point quality codes will be implemented at the point level. A rating 
quality can be defaulted with overrides for each point. Rating quality can be applied to 
equations. Rating quality can be communicated via an input range. 

Requirement: rgs-2 

Description: The WML2 RGS implementation contains data used to complete the 
calculation of derived information. The definition of the process that would be employed 
to complete the transfer function / transformation is not currently in scope, my may be in 
scope at a later revision 

Requirement: rgs-20 

Description: Conversions can specify Y scale range validated range (within rating), 
extrapolated range, beyond extrapolation. 

Requirement: rgs-21 

Description: There is a need for defining an input range purpose. An input range purpose 
should be a controlled vocabulary, the semantic meaning of each input range purpose 
should be defined against the vocabulary. Input range contents may vary over time, so 
should be referenced by periods of applicability. 

Requirement: rgs-22 

Description: The format should enable the inclusion of metadata to enable the 
communication ratings approval and review process 



OGC  13-021r3  

 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Requirement: rgs-23 

Description: The application of 3d ratings is a stretch gaol. As such it is out of scope 
until scope is reviewed 

Requirement: rgs-24 

Description: We supply conversion information that is able to be used in simple or 
complex conversion chains. Communication of information that defines the 'chain 
conversion process' or 'work flow' of simple or complex chain conversions in not in 
scope. 

Requirement: rgs-25 

Description: Specific methods for the communication of uncertainty information are not 
currently agreed across the domain. This is an area of current domain development. The 
standard should be sufficiently extensible to enable incorporation when a direction is 
available. 

Requirement: rgs-26 

Description: A RatingObservation is a summary result of the gauging activity, it is not a 
detail of the measurements taken to determine the gauging result. 

Requirement: rgs-27 

Description: RatingObservations need to be connected to the rating for which they 
apply. This may be by direct, linked or other methods 

Requirement: rgs-28 

Description: The rich suite of USGS site visit information is out of scope for this activity 

Requirement: rgs-29 

Description: Rating type specialised metadata. Stream discharge RatingObservations 
have specific metadata that is of value and should be communicated. Other 
ratingObservations would not be required to contain this information. 

Requirement: rgs-3 

Description: Communcating the gaugings used in the creation of a rating is in scope. The 
gaugings if interest are: 

 Gaugings used that were taken in the period of application of the rating 
 Gaugings not used that were taken in the period of application period of the rating 
 Gaugings used that we taken outside the application period of the rating. - e.g. 

high flow rating 



OGC  13-021r3  

 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Requirement: rgs-30 

Description: RatingObservations may be used by one or many ratings. 

Requirement: rgs-31 

Description: Rating type specialised metadata. A WQ sepecialsed type is in scope as a 
stretch gaol. External input would be required to determine the content 

Requirement: rgs-33 

Description: A RatingObservation contains a definition of From and To parameters. The 
observations is not limited to stream discharge observations. 

Requirement: rgs-34 

Description: RatingObservations must be able to be delivered seperate from ratings. 
Rating observation may optionally be delivered inline with rating details 

Requirement: rgs-36 

Description: The conversion application period list may refer to a conversion table more 
than once. e.g. a conversion table is reused 

Requirement: rgs-37 

Description: A range value may refer to to a specific value, rather than a range. An 
example is references to flood extent polygons, the flood extent relates to a specific Y 
scale value and is not valid for a ranged of Y values (the range is vary narrow). 

 

- Range Start value may equal range End Value 

Requirement: rgs-4 

Description: The inclusion of user specified user information that varies across the Y 
scale of a conversion is in scope. This would be used to give further information for the 
conversion.  e.g. Control/Chanel/OverBankFlow   Assessment of other sensor 
application range 

Requirement: rgs-5 

Description: Ratings should always have a point table supplied that is expanded at a 
sufficient Y scale resolution to enable linear interpolation between the supplied points. 
The creator of the data file will choose the export resolution such that linear interpolation 
is appropriate. 

Requirement: rgs-6 



OGC  13-021r3  

 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Description: Ratings may have the equation that is the source system definition of the 
rating. This may be supplied using rgs-4. 

Requirement: rgs-7 

Description: A point rating table may have additional information the enables the source 
system to describe how it stored the table. 

Requirement: rgs-8 

Description: The implementation of loop rating curves is out of scope. Methods of 
implementation are possible, however the practical uptake of loop ratings means the topic 
is very much an edge case. It is understood that issues of uncertainty outstrip the accuracy 
issues that loop ratings address. Technology has provided other solutions through the use 
of velocity index tables and velocity sensing hardware. 

Requirement: rgs-9 

Description: Reverse conversions are not supported implicitly by either point or 
equations conversions. Reverse conversions can be defined explicitly.
