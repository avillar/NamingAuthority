Warning 

OGC official documents use a triple decimal-dot notation (i.e. MM.xx.ss). This document may 
be identified as MM.xx (Major.minor) and may include increments to the third dot series 
(schema changes) without any modification to this document, or the version displayed on the 
document. This means, for example, that a document labelled with versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 or 
even 1.1.9 are exactly the same except for modifications to the official schemas that are 
maintained and perpetually located at: http://schemas.opengis.net/.  Note that corrections to the 
document are registered via corrigendums.  A corrigendum will change the base document and 
notice will be given by appending a c# to the version (where # specifies the corrigendum 
number).  In corrigendums that correct both the schemas and the base document, the third triplet 
of the document version will increment and the ‘c1’ or subsequent identifier will be appended, 
however the schemas will only increase the third triplet of the version.

The Geography Markup Language (GML) was originally developed within the Open Geospatial Consortium,  
(OGC). ISO 19136:2007 was prepared by ISO/TC 211 jointly with OGC. 

This version of GML is backwards compatible with the previous version GML 3.2 (OGC document 07-036) 
which is identical to ISO 19136:2007.

Introduction 

Geography Markup Language is an XML grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application 
schemas as well as the transport and storage of geographic information. 

The key concepts used by Geography Markup Language (GML) to model the world are drawn from the 
ISO 19100 series of International Standards and the OpenGIS Abstract Specification. 

A feature is an "abstraction of real world phenomena" (ISO 19101); it is a geographic feature if it is associated 
with a location relative to the Earth. So a digital representation of the real world may be thought of as a set of 
features. The state of a feature is defined by a set of properties, where each property may be thought of as a 
{name, type, value} triple. 

The number of properties a feature may have, together with their names and types, is determined by its type 
definition. Geographic features with geometry are those with properties that may be geometry-valued. A 
feature collection is a collection of features that may itself be regarded as a feature; as a consequence a 
feature collection has a feature type and thus may have distinct properties of its own, in addition to the 
features it contains. 

Following ISO 19109, the feature types of an application or application domain is usually captured in an 
application schema. A GML application schema is specified in XML Schema and can be constructed in two 
different and alternative ways: 

 by adhering to the rules specified in ISO 19109 for application schemas in UML, and conforming to both 
the constraints on such schemas and the rules for mapping them to GML application schemas specified 
in this International Standard; 

 by adhering to the rules for GML application schemas specified in this International Standard for creating 
a GML application schema directly in XML Schema. 

Both ways are supported by this International Standard. To ensure proper use of the conceptual modelling 
framework of the ISO 19100 series of International Standards, all application schemas are expected to be 
modelled in accordance with the General Feature Model as specified in ISO 19109. Within the ISO 19100 
series, UML is the preferred language by which to model conceptual schemas. 

GML specifies XML encodings, conformant with ISO 19118, of several of the conceptual classes defined in 
the ISO 19100 series of International Standards and the OpenGIS Abstract Specification. These conceptual 
models include those defined in: 

 ISO/TS 19103 — Conceptual schema language (units of measure, basic types); 

 ISO 19107 — Spatial schema (geometry and topology objects); 

 ISO 19108 — Temporal schema (temporal geometry and topology objects, temporal reference systems); 

 ISO 19109 — Rules for application schemas (features); 

 ISO 19111 — Spatial referencing by coordinates (coordinate reference systems); 

 ISO 19123 — Schema for coverage geometry and functions; 

 ISO 19148 — Linear Referencing. 



OGC 10-129r1 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 7 
 

The aim is to provide a standardized encoding (i.e. a standardized implementation in XML) of types specified 
in the conceptual models specified by the International Standards listed above. If every application schema 
were encoded independently and the encoding process included the types from, for example, ISO 19108, then, 
without unambiguous and completely fixed encoding rules, the XML encodings would be different. Also, since 
every implementation platform has specific strengths and weaknesses, it is helpful to standardize XML 
encodings for core geographic information concepts modelled in the ISO 19100 series of International 
Standards and commonly used in application schemas. 

In many cases, the mapping from the conceptual classes is straightforward, while in some cases the mapping 
is more complex (a detailed description of the mapping is part of this International Standard). 

In addition, GML provides XML encodings for additional concepts not yet modelled in the ISO 19100 series of 
International Standards or the OpenGIS Abstract Specification, for example, dynamic features, simple 
observations or value objects. 

Predefined types of geographic feature in GML include coverages and simple observations. 

A coverage is a subtype of feature that has a coverage function with a spatiotemporal domain and a value set 
range of homogeneous 1- to n-dimensional tuples. A coverage may represent one feature or a collection of 
features "to model and make visible spatial relationships between, and the spatial distribution of, Earth 
phenomena" (OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6 [20]) and a coverage "acts as a function to return values 
from its range for any direct position within its spatiotemporal domain" (ISO 19123). 

An observation models the act of observing, often with a camera or some other procedure, a person or some 
form of instrument (Merriam-Webster Dictionary: "an act of recognizing and noting a fact or occurrence often 
involving measurement with instruments"). An observation is considered to be a GML feature with a time at 
which the observation took place, and with a value for the observation. 

A reference system provides a scale of measurement for assigning values to a position, time or other 
descriptive quantity or quality. 

A coordinate reference system consists of a set of coordinate system axes that is related to the Earth through 
a datum that defines the size and shape of the Earth. 

A temporal reference system provides standard units for measuring time and describing temporal length or 
duration. 

A reference system dictionary provides definitions of reference systems used in spatial or temporal geometries. 

Spatial geometries are the values of spatial feature properties. They indicate the coordinate reference system 
in which their measurements have been made. The "parent" geometry element of a geometric complex or 
geometric aggregate makes this indication for its constituent geometries. 

Temporal geometries are the values of temporal feature properties. Like their spatial counterparts, temporal 
geometries indicate the temporal reference system in which their measurements have been made. 

Spatial or temporal topologies are used to express the different topological relationships between features. 

A units-of-measure dictionary provides definitions of numerical measures of physical quantities, such as length, 
temperature and pressure, and of conversions between units.

Geographic information — Geography Markup Language (GML) 
— Extended schemas and encoding rules 

1 Scope 

The Geography Markup Language (GML) is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118 for the transport 
and storage of geographic information modelled in accordance with the conceptual modelling framework used 
in the ISO 19100 series of International Standards and including both the spatial and non-spatial properties of 
geographic features. 

This International Standard defines the XML Schema syntax, mechanisms and conventions that: 

 provide an open, vendor-neutral framework for the description of geospatial application schemas for the 
transport and storage of geographic information in XML; 

 allow profiles that support proper subsets of GML framework descriptive capabilities; 

 support the description of geospatial application schemas for specialized domains and information 
communities; 

 enable the creation and maintenance of linked geographic application schemas and datasets; 

 support the storage and transport of application schemas and datasets; 

 increase the ability of organizations to share geographic application schemas and the information they 
describe. 

Implementers may decide to store geographic application schemas and information in GML, or they may 
decide to convert from some other storage format on demand and use GML only for schema and data 
transport. 

This International Standard builds on GML 3.2, published by ISO as ISO 19136:2007, and extends it with 
additional schema components and requirements. 

NOTE If an ISO 19109 conformant application schema described in UML is used as the basis for the storage and 
transportation of geographic information, this International Standard provides normative rules for the mapping of such an 
application schema to a GML application schema in XML Schema and, as such, to an XML encoding for data with a 
logical structure in accordance with the ISO 19109 conformant application schema. 

2 Conformance 

This Standard defines XML implementations of concepts used in spatiotemporal datasets. It extends the XML 
implementations specified in the GML 3.2 (ISO 19136:2007) standard. Requirements and conformance 
classes specified in GML 3.2 (ISO 19136:2007) apply for this version of GML, too.  

XML instances that encode geographic information using one or more of the schemas specified in this 
document are the standardisation target of the requirements stated in this document. 

The implementation is described using the XML Schema language and Schematron.  

Conformance classes are specified in Clauses 6 to 12 of this Standard.

5.3 Deprecated parts of previous versions of GML 

The verb "deprecate" provides notice that the referenced portion is being retained for backwards compatibility 
with earlier versions but may be removed from or superseeded in this or a future version. 

6 Additional basic types 

6.1 Target namespace 

All schema components specified in this Clause are in the target namespace: 

http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.3/xbt 

6.2 Localisable strings 

6.2.1 LanguageStringType 

The type gmlxbt:LanguageStringType adds an optional xml:lang attribute to xs:string. It is provided as a base 
type for linguistic text for use within the GML schemas and in GML application schemas. 

<complexType name="LanguageStringType"> 
<simpleContent> 

<extension base="xs:string"> 
<attribute ref="xml:lang"/> 

</extension> 
</simpleContent> 

</complexType> 
 
NOTE The name "LanguageStringType" was selected to align the naming with the equivalent type in the 
OWS Common standard. 
 
6.2.2 Additional types based on LanguageStringType 

The following types from GML 3.2 are defined in the http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.3/xbt schema with the same 
content model as in GML 3.2 with the exception that gmlxbt:LanguageStringType is used in place of xs:string:  

- gml:CodeType,  

- gml:CodeWithAuthorityType  

In addition, the global property elements gmlxbt:description and gmlxbt:remarks have an optional xml:lang 
attribute in their content model. These elements are in the substitution group of the GML 3.2 property element 
with the same local name. 

- gmlxbt:description  

- gmlxbt:remarks.  

6.3 TimePositionUnion 

In GML 3.2 the simple type gml:TimePositionUnion is a union of XML Schema simple types which instantiate 
the subtypes for temporal position described in ISO 19108. These are: 



OGC 10-129r1 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 13 
 

- gml:CalDate (union of xs:date, xs:gYearMonth and xs:gYear) 

- xs:time  

- xs:dateTime  

- xs:anyURI  

- xs:decimal 

ISO 8601:2004 Clause 4.1.2 specifies the Calendar Date and its representations with reduced accuracy (i.e., 
YYYY-MM and YYYY). gml:CalDate is designed to support their encoding. 

ISO 8601:2004 Clause 4.1.3 specifies the Ordinal Date, which is composed from the calendar year and the 
calendar day of the year (YYYY-DDD). 

ISO 8601:2004 Clause 4.1.4 specifies the Week Date, which is composed from the calendar year, the 
calendar week and the calendar day of the week (YYYY-Www-D). Clause 4.1.4.3 specifies a Week Date 
representation with reduced accuracy that omits the day of the week component (YYYY-Www). 

The ISO 8601:2004 Ordinal Date and Week Date with reduced accuracy are commonly used in some 
communities (for example, aviation) but are not supported by gml:TimePositionUnion. 
gmlxbt:TimePositionUnion is provided to accommodate representations of these sibling date-representations 
from ISO 8601:2004 by adding gmlxbt:OrdDate and gmlxbt:WeekDate to the union. 

<simpleType name="TimePositionUnion"> 
 <union memberTypes="gml:CalDate gmlxbt:OrdDate gmlxbt:WeekDate time dateTime anyURI 
decimal"/>  
</simpleType> 
 
<simpleType name="OrdDate">

7 Compact Encodings of Commonly Used GML Geometries 

7.1 Target namespace 

All schema components specified in this Clause are in the target namespace: 

http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.3/ce 

7.2 Introduction 

The simplified geometry encodings presented in this Clause conform to the spatial schema (ISO 19107), but 
are offered as compact encoding alternatives to some of the existing GML geometries specified in GML 3.2. 
The compact encodings follow the idea of the compact gml:LineString encoding, which represents a curve that 
is equivalent to the gml:Curve encoding restricted to the use of LineStringSegment elements as depicted in 
the following diagram. 

 

 
 
7.3 SimplePolygon 

A gmlce:SimplePolygon is a specialized polygon that has a simplified encoding of the logically equivalent 
gml:Surface with a single gml:PolygonPatch as its surface patch consisting of a single gml:LinearRing as its 
exterior boundary and does not have any interior boundary.  

 



OGC 10-129r1 

16 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

 
 
NOTE The boundary of a gmlce:SimplePolygon is coplanar and the polygon uses planar interpolation in its 
interior. 

The usage of the term 'simple' here refers to a specialized polygon with a simplified encoding, which is simply 
connected (no interior rings) and uses a simple closed curve (no self-crossings) to represent its single 
boundary ring. The schema element declaration and corresponding type definition is as follows: 

  <element name="SimplePolygon"  
type="gmlce:SimplePolygonType" 

   substitutionGroup="gmlce:AbstractSimplePolygon"/> 
     
   <element name="AbstractSimplePolygon" type="gml:AbstractSurfaceType" 
    substitutionGroup="gml:AbstractSurface"/> 
     
  <complexType name="SimplePolygonType"> 
    <complexContent> 
      <extension base="gml:AbstractSurfaceType"> 
        <sequence> 
          <choice> 
            <choice minOccurs="3" maxOccurs="unbounded"> 
              <element ref="gml:pos"/> 
              <element ref="gml:pointProperty"/> 
            </choice> 
            <element ref="gml:posList"/> 
          </choice> 
        </sequence> 
      </extension> 
    </complexContent> 
  </complexType> 
 
The last coordinate does not have to repeat the first coordinate in this simplified encoding, so only three 
control points are required to specify a simple polygon. For this reason, the inner choice declaration above 
has the corresponding occurrence constraint minOccurs="3". 

 

7.4 SimpleRectangle 

A SimpleRectangle is the special case of a simple polygon, which has exactly 4 control points in its boundary 
encoding representing the 4 corners of the rectangle.

7.5 SimpleTriangle 

A SimpleTriangle is the special case of a simple polygon, which has exactly 3 control points in its boundary 
encoding representing the 3 corners of the triangle.

8 Triangulated Irregular Networks 

8.1 Target namespace 

All schema components specified in this Clause are in the target namespace: 

http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.3/tin 

8.2 Introduction 

The support for Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN) in GML 3.2 is consistent with the OGC Geometry 
Abstract Specification, ISO 19107:2003 Spatial schema and the OGC Simple Feature Common Architecture. 
However, three areas of concern of the TIN model in these standards are addressed by the new schema 
components to support typical civil engineering practice: 

- Need for more robust set of "TIN elements" 

- Need for a simpler triangle encoding 

- Need for a by-reference encoding of the triangulated surface

8.3 TriangulatedSurface 

<element name="TriangulatedSurface" type="gml:SurfaceType" 
substitutionGroup="gml:Surface"/> 
 
gmltin:TriangulatedSurface implements ISO 19107 GM_TriangulatedSurface (see D.2.3.4 and ISO 
19107:2003, 6.4.37).  

A triangulated surface is a polyhedral surface that is composed only of triangles. There is no restriction on 
how the triangulation is derived. 

gml:patches encapsulates the triangles of the triangulated surface. All patches shall be simple triangle 
patches. 

8.4 SimpleTrianglePatch

   </extension> 
  </complexContent> 
</complexType> 
 
<element name="SimpleTrianglePatch" type="gmltin:SimpleTrianglePatchType" 
substitutionGroup="gml:AbstractSurfacePatch"/> 
 
gmltin:SimpleTrianglePatch is based upon the pattern used in the GML 3.3 SimpleTriangle, rather 
than the GML 3.2 Triangle. 

A gmltin:SimpleTrianglePatch is a surface patch that is defined by a set of three points. The points 
shall be coplanar and the resultant simple triangle uses planar interpolation in its interior.  The boundary of 
simple triangle patch can be obtained by constructing a gml:LinearRing, defined by four coordinate tuples 
representing the three points such that the first point is repeated as the last point, with linear interpolation 
between the points.  

interpolation is fixed to "planar", i.e. an interpolation shall return points on a single plane. The boundary 
of the patch shall be contained within that plane.

gmltin:TINElement implements ISO/IEC 13249-3  ST_TINElement (see ISO/IEC FCD 13249-3  15.1.1 
ST_TINElement Type).   It specifies elements associated with a TIN which can be:  

1) constraints (boundary, break line, soft break, control contour, break void, drape void, void, hole, stop line) 
applied to a TIN surface after the initial Delaunay triangulation which modify the surface, 

2) points (random points, group spots) which are the vertices of simple triangles that define the TIN surface 
or vertices of constraints, or 

3) user-defined. 

The gmltin:elementType property specifies the type of TIN element.  Allowable values are specified by 
the gmltin:TINElementTypeType codelist.

The gmltin:elementID property allows for an optional integer value to numerically identify the TIN 
element. 

The gmltin:elementTag property allows for an optional string value to alphanumerically identify the TIN 
element. 

The gmltin:elementGeometry property specifies the geometry of the TIN element.  The allowable 
geometry type is dependent upon the value of the gmltin:elementType:   

- random points and group spot TIN elements shall have a 3D gml:MultiPoint  geometry 

- boundary, break void and void TIN elements shall have a 3D gml:Polygon geometry 

- drape void and hole TIN elements shall have a 2D or 3D gml:Polygon geometry 

- break line, soft break and control contour TIN elements shall have a 3D gml:LineString geometry 

- stop line TIN elements shall have a 2D or 3D gml:LineString geometry 

- for a user-defined TIN element, the choice of gml:GeometryPropertyType shall be user-defined.

gmltin:TINElementTypeType is a codelist which is the union of an enumeration of pre-defined TIN 
element types and a pattern for specifying a user-defined TIN type. 

A TIN element of type ‘random points’ (gmltin:randomPoints) represents points on the surface of known 
elevation from which triangles can be generated or which represent linestring points contained in other TIN 
element geometries. 

A TIN element of type ‘group spot’ (gmltin:groupSpot) represents a collection of related points on the 
surface of known elevation from which triangles can be generated or which represent linestring points 
contained in other TIN element geometries. 

A TIN element of type ‘boundary’ (gmltin:boundary) is used to specify the boundary of the TIN surface.  
As a constraint applied to a TIN surface after the initial Delaunay triangulation, it causes the surface to be 
clipped to the boundary TIN element’s gml:Polygon geometry value.  This may result in the elimination or 
addition of points contained in the initial random points or group spots TIN elements.  It may also result in 
localized re-triangulation at the boundary.  It is implementation-defined whether interior boundaries are 
supported. 

A TIN element of type ‘breakline’ (gmltin:breakline) is used to represent a local ridge or depression in 
the TIN surface.  When a breakline is specified for a TIN surface, simple triangle patches must be adjusted so 
that no triangle is crossed by the breakline.  Part or all of the breakline becomes an edge of two or more 
triangles.  The elevation along the breakline takes precedence over the elevation of the original triangulated 
surface for the entire length of the breakline. 

A TIN element of type ‘soft break’ (gmltin:softBreak) behaves as a ‘breakline’ (see above) except that 
contour lines generated for the surface can be smoothed where they cross soft breaks. 

A TIN element of type ‘control contour’ (gmltin:controlContour) behaves as a ‘breakline’ (see above).  
The z coordinate values must be identical for all points in the ‘control contour’ gml:LineString geometry.  
Triangles within the vicinity of a control contour need to be assessed during re-triangulation to insure that they 
are not zero slope triangles (all three vertices fall on the same control contour). 

Voids enclose a voided area of the TIN surface.  They can be represented by either break, drape or (regular) 
void types of TIN element.  Void geometry is of type gml:Polygon, which might include interior boundaries.  
Triangles within a void still exist in the TIN surface but are considered to be void.  Triangles inside of the 
gml:Polygon interior boundary are in the exterior of the gml:Polygon and therefore not in the void: these 
triangles are therefore not considered to be void. 

For a void TIN element of type ‘break void’ (gmltin:breakVoid) the boundary linestrings 
(gml:LineString) of the 3D gml:Polygon behave as breaklines in that triangles in the simple triangle 
patch collection must be adjusted so that no triangle is crossed by the break void boundary.  Part or all of the 
break void boundary becomes an edge of two or more triangles.  The elevation of this break void boundary 
takes precedence over the elevation of the original triangulated surface for the entire length of the boundary. 

For a void TIN element of type ‘drape void’ (gmltin:drapeVoid) the boundary linestrings 
(gml:LineString) of the 2D or 3D gml:Polygon behave as breaklines in that triangles in the simple 
triangle patch collection must be adjusted so that no triangle is crossed by the drape void boundary.  Part or 
all of the drape void boundary becomes an edge of two or more triangles.  However, for drape voids, the 
elevation of the original triangulated surface takes precedence over the elevation of the drape void boundary. 

For a void TIN element of type (regular) ‘void’ (gmltin:void) the boundary linestrings (gml:LineString) 
of the 3D gml:Polygon behave as breaklines in that triangles in the simple triangle patch collection must be

adjusted so that no triangle is crossed by the void boundary.  Part or all of the void boundary becomes an 
edge of two or more triangles.  However, for regular voids, only the elevations of the void boundary vertices 
take precedence over the elevation of corresponding points on the original surface.  That is, these vertices are 
treated as points for triangulating.  The regular void boundaries between these vertices are handled as drape 
void boundaries -  elevations from the original surface take precedence. 

A hole is an area of a TIN surface, defined by a 2D or 3D gml:Polygon, which is to be treated as a hole in 
the surface in that the triangles within this area still exist but are considered to be part of the hole.  The 
difference between a void and a hole is realized when two TIN surfaces are merged.  When merging TIN 
surface A with TIN surface B, a void in surface A will take precedence over what is in the same area in B, the 
result being retention of the voided A triangles.  A hole in surface A results in that part of surface B showing 
through the hole and becoming part of the resultant merged surface.  Though GML does not support merging 
of TINs, it is necessary to persist the distinction between voids and holes to make this information available to 
applications which do. 

Hole boundaries are different than an interior boundary of a surface.  The hole is still part of the interior of the 
surface since the triangles still exist.  They are merely considered as being in the hole so applications know 
how to deal with them in a visibility context.  This also allows for "islands" to exist inside the holes (if the hole 
polygon has interior rings): here the triangles exist and are not hole triangles.  Had the triangles in the hole 
been eliminated, islands could not be supported in a single surface. 

A TIN element of type ‘hole’ (gmltin:hole) encloses an area of the TIN surface designated as a hole.  
When a hole is specified for gmltin:TINElement, the boundary linestrings (gml:LineString) of the 2D 
or 3D gml:Polygon behave as breaklines in that triangles in the simple triangle patch collection must be 
adjusted so that no triangle is crossed by the hole boundary.  Part or all of the hole boundary becomes an 
edge of two or more triangles.  Hole boundaries are treated like drape void boundaries in that the elevation of 
the original triangulated surface takes precedence over the elevation of the hole boundary, if present. 

A TIN element of type ‘stopLine’ (gmltin:stopLine) is used to specify areas where the local continuity or 
regularity of the TIN surface is questionable.  It is implementation-defined whether triangles in the simple 
triangle patch collection whose boundaries are (2D) crossed by a stop line are removed from the collection of 
simple triangle patches or are retained but enclosed within a ‘drape void’ (gmltin:drapeVoid) type of 
gmltin:TINElement.

9.2 Introduction 

GML 3.2 (and other OGC specifications) so far mainly support 2-D and 3-D spatial locations.  An alternative 
location scheme is to use linearly referenced locations, where a location is specified as being at a certain 
distance along (and perhaps offset from) a linear element.  The linear element might be a feature which 
exhibits linear behaviour (i.e., it is linearly measurable), a curve type of geometry, or a directed edge type of 
topology. 

A significant amount of historical data is currently linearly referenced, especially in the transportation, piping, 
petroleum and mineral exploration industries. There are advantages of using this scheme over (or in addition 
to) spatial referencing.   

Just as spatial data may utilize a variety of spatial (coordinate) reference systems, linearly referenced 
locations use a wide variety of Linear Referencing Methods (LRM).  A well documented theoretical basis has 
been developed to support many of the more common LRMs in practice internationally today (ISO/DIS 19148 
and OGC Abstract Specification Topic 19).

expression.

gmllr:LinearElement implements ISO 19148 LR_LinearElement (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.2.3).   

A gmllr:LinearElement specifies the underlying linear element upon which the measures in the Linear 
Referencing System are made.  The linear element can be either a feature, a curve geometry or a topological 
edge. 

The element gmllr:feature specifies that the linear element is a gml:AbstractFeature.  
gmllr:feature includes any feature as defined in ISO 19109:2005 7.3 which can be linearly measured.  

The element gmllr:curve specifies that the linear element is a gml: AbstractCurve. gmllr:curve 
includes any one-dimensional geometry of type GM_Curve from ISO 19107:2003 6.3.16 which can be linearly 
measured.  Spatial positions can be projected onto the gml: AbstractCurveto determine a corresponding 
linearly referenced location along the curve and vice versa.   

The element gmllr:edge specifies that the linear element is a gml:DirectedEdge.  gmllr:edge includes 
any one-dimensional topology of type TP_DirectedEdge from ISO 19107:2003 7.3.15 which can be linearly 
measured.  Directed edges typically have one or more weights associated with them instead of having a 
length.  Measuring along a directed edge therefore entails prorating a weight value.  Consequently, the Linear 
Referencing Method of choice is typically of the interpolative type and unlikely to be of the relative type. 

gmllr:defaultLRM implements the ISO 19148 LR_ILinearElement::defaultLRM() operation (see ISO/DIS 
19148, 6.2.8.2). 

The element gmllr:defaultLRM specifies the default Linear Referencing Method of the 
gmllr:LinearElement.  This is used for all measurements made along the gmllr:LinearElement 
unless specified otherwise in a gmllr:PositionExpression or otherwise explicitly overridden.   

gmllr:measure implements the ISO 19148 LR_ILinearElement::measure(measureAttribute) operation (see 
ISO/DIS 19148, 6.2.8.3). 

The element gmllr:measure specifies the value of one of the measure attributes of the 
gmllr:LinearElement.  This is usually one of its length attributes or, in the case of gmllr:edge, one of 
its weight attributes.  Representing the overall length (or weight) of the gmllr:LinearElement, the 
gmllr:measure value is used for all calculations requiring the total linear element length, unless explicitly 
overridden, for example, when converting from an absolute to an interpolative Linear Referencing Method. 

gmllr:startValue implements the ISO 19148 LR_ILinearElement::startValue(LRM) operation (see 
ISO/DIS 19148, 6.2.8.6).   



OGC 10-129r1

The element gmllr:startValue specifies the measure value at the start of the gmllr:LinearElement 
for each appropriate Linear Referencing Method. If not provided, a default value of 0 (zero) is assumed for all 
Linear Referencing Methods. 

9.3.6 LinearElementPropertyType

A property that has a linear element as its value domain may either be an appropriate linear element 
encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote linear element (where remote 
includes linear elements located elsewhere in the same document). Either the reference or the contained 
element shall be given, but neither both nor none.

Because the start value is a function of the Linear Referencing Method, the gmllr:StartValueType 
extends a start value of type double with two attributes. 

The optional attribute gmllr:uom provides the units of measure for the start value.   If none is provided, the 
uom value defaults to the units value of the Linear Referencing Method. 

The mandatory attribute gmllr:lrm specifies the Linear Referencing Method for which this start value 
applies.  Though the type is anyURI, it is expected that the value will be a reference to an already defined 
gmllr:LinearReferencingMethod object.

linear element. 

The element gmllr:name specifies the name of the Linear Referencing Method, such as "kilometre-point".  
Allowable values are specified by the gmllr:LRMNameType codelist. 

The element gmllr:type specifies the type of Linear Referencing Method.  Allowable values are specified

The optional element gmllr:constraint allows for optional string values which specify any constraints 
imposed by the Linear Referencing Method.

gmllr:DistanceExpression implements ISO 19148 LR_DistanceExpression (see ISO/DIS 19148, 
6.2.12). 

A gmllr:DistanceExpression specifies the linear referenced measure value.  This includes the distance 
measured along the linear element.  If the Linear Referencing Method gmllr:LRMType is "relative", the 
distance expression also includes an along referent to specify where the measuring begins.  Otherwise, 
measuring begins at the start of the linear element.  Measuring is in the direction of the linear element, unless 
a towards referent is provided. 

The element gmllr:distanceAlong specifies the measure value (usually a distance) of the distance 
expression.  It is of type gmllr:MeasureType.  gmllr:MeasureType is the same as gml:MeasureType 
except that the uom value is optional.  If none is provided, the uom value defaults to the units value of the 
Linear Referencing Method. 

If the Linear Referencing Method gmllr:type is ‘absolute’, the distance along is measured from the start of 
the linear element.  If ‘relative’, it is measured from the along referent’s from referent.  If ‘interpolative’, it is 
based upon the default length or weight of the linear element (gmllr:measure). 

The optional element gmllr:referent specifies the referent associated with the distance expression 
gmllr:distanceAlong value.  A referent is only appropriate if the Linear Referencing Method 
gmllr:type is "relative". If the referent is absent, then the position is measured from the start of the linear 
element.

a from referent.

gmllr:LinearElement. This can be a reference marker, an intersection, a jurisdictional boundary, or a 
landmark.  

The element gmllr:name specifies the name of the referent, which is of type gml:CodeType to allow 
specification of the authority which created the name. 

The element gmllr:type specifies the type of referent.  Allowable values are specified by the 
gmllr:ReferentTypeType codelist. 

The optional element gmllr:position specifies the spatial position of the referent, given in some 
coordinate reference system.   

The optional element gmllr:location specifies the location of the referent given as a linearly referenced 
location (gmllr:PositionExpression) along the feature which owns the referent.  The Linear Referencing 
Method contained within the position expression specifies how this measurement is made: it could be absolute 
from the start of the element, relative from the previous (or other) referent, or interpolative.  The Linear

Referencing Method of the referent location gmllr:PositionExpression does not have to be the same 
as the Linear Referencing Method of the position expression containing the distance expression which uses 
this referent.  There shall be no offset expression in the referent location gmllr:PositionExpression; all 
referents shall lie on the linear feature. 

At least one of the attributes gmllr:position or gmllr:location is usually specified, unless it can be 
implied. If both are given they shall refer to the same physical location. 

The element gmllr:ownedBy specifies the feature which owns the referent.  Referents are owned by a 
single feature.  For example, the reference markers along Interstate 95 are owned by the feature which 
represents Interstate 95.  The referent representing the intersection with First Avenue along Washington 
Street is owned by Washington Street if it is used to specify relative linearly referenced locations along 
Washington Street.  The location of this referent will most likely be specified with a position expression along 
Washington Street.  A different referent can represent the intersection with Washington Street along First 
Avenue.  This referent is owned by First Avenue and is used to specify relative linearly referenced locations 
along First Avenue. 

The gml:AbstractFeature which owns a gmllr:Referent does not have to be the same 
gml:AbstractFeature which is the gml:LinearElement for the gml:PositionExpression 
containing that gmllr:Referent.  For example, if US Interstate Highway 95 is coincident with US Federal 
Route 1, it is possible to specify locations along Route 1 (the linear element in the position expression) using 
referents owned by Interstate 95 (reference post 18).  In this case, the location of the referent itself most likely 
would have been made along Interstate 95 as the linear element since the referent is owned by Interstate 95.

gmllr:LRMNameType is a codelist which includes the informative values of Linear Referencing Method 
names from ISO 19148 Annex C and also allows for extensions of user-defined Linear Referencing Method 
names.  Because there is such a diverse range of Linear Referencing Methods and names, this is offered as 
informative only.  The enumerated names should only be used if their meaning matches that of the so-named 
Linear Referencing Method in ISO/DIS 19148, Annex C.   

In accordance with Linear Referencing Methods having a gmllr:type of ‘absolute’, measurements are 
made along the linear element from its start, in the direction of the linear element.   Commonly used absolute 
Linear Referencing Methods include milepoint (also known as true mileage), its metric analogue kilometre-
point (also known as kilopoint), chainage, hectometer-point, reverse milepoint and its metric equivalent 
reverse kilometer-point and milepoint with lateral offsets in feet. 

An LRM name of ‘milepoint’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are made in 
decimal miles along the linear element from its start, in the direction of the linear element (see ISO/DIS 19148, 
C.2.2). 

An LRM name of ‘trueMileage’ designates an alternative name for a ‘milepoint’ Linear Referencing Method 
(see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.3). 

An LRM name of ‘kilometre-point’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is identical to the ‘milepoint’ 
Linear Referencing Method except that the gmllr:units is kilometre instead of mile and the 
gmllr:distanceAlong is measured in kilometres (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.4). 

An LRM name of ‘kilopoint’ designates an alternative name for a ‘kilometre-point’ Linear Referencing Method 
(see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.4).

An LRM name of ‘chainage’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is identical to the ‘milepoint’ 
Linear Referencing Method except that the gmllr:units is  metre instead of mile.  Though the original 
British definition of "chainage" might imply measuring in chains, "chainage" was adopted as a consensus term 
for this Linear Referencing Method by a team of European Road Authority representatives (including British) 
for ISO 14825 Geographic Data Files (GDF). (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.5). 

An LRM name of ‘hectometre-point’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which  is identical to the 
milepoint LRM except that the gmllr:units is hectometre (100 metres) instead of mile and the 
gmllr:distanceAlong is measured in hectometres. (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.6). 

An LRM name of ‘reverseMilepoint’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are made 
in decimal miles along the linear element from its end, in the direction opposite to the direction of the linear 
element (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.7). 

An LRM name of ‘reverseKilometre-point’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is identical to the 
‘reverseMilepoint’ Linear Referencing Method except that the gmllr:units is kilometre instead of mile and 
the gmllr:distanceAlong is measured in kilometres (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.7). 

Many organizations establish a topological network of links and nodes and then specify linear locations along 
uniquely identified links as an absolute distance from the start of the link (the begin node location). This 
International Standard is very specific about separating the linear element (that which is being measured) from 
the Linear Referencing Method (how it is measured).  Therefore, what is typically referred to as "link offset" is 
actually the application of an absolute Linear Referencing Method (milepoint, kilometre-point) to link linear 
elements.  

In a topological network, links do not have length and cannot be measured.  In order to use a milepoint or 
kilometre-point Linear Referencing Method then, a gmllr:Curve geometry is typically associated with each 
link.  Though measurement is actually done along the curve, it is portrayed as being along the associated link.  
This International Standard also supports the notion of interpolative measurement along a 
gmllr:DirectedEdge, so that a percentage or normalized Linear Referencing Method can be used to 
specify linear locations along a link. (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.8). 

Therefore, an LRM name of ‘linkOffset’ designating a Linear Referencing Method with a fixed linear element 
type of link is therefore not included in the enumeration. 

An LRM name of ‘milepointWithLateralOffsetsInFeet’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is an 
extension of the ‘milepoint’ Linear Referencing Method.  A location is first determined by measuring along the 
linear element a distance in decimal miles specified by the gmllr:distanceAlong value.  Then, if a 
gmllr:LateralOffsetExpression is specified, this location is adjusted in accordance with the 
gmllr:offsetLateralDistance  given in feet.  The metric analogue would be kilometre-point or 
hectometre-point with offsets in metres. (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2.9).  Support for these Linear Referencing 
Methods requires a Linear Referencing Method With Offsets (see 9.5). 

In accordance with Linear Referencing Methods having a gmllr:type of ‘relative’,  measurements are made 
along the linear element from a specified from referent location, usually in the direction of the linear element 
unless overridden by a towards referent, in which case the direction from the from referent towards the 
towards referent.  Commonly used relative Linear Referencing Methods include milepost, its metric equivalent 
kilopost (also known as kilometre-post), reference post, County milepoint, cross street, and Control Section. 

An LRM name of ‘milepost’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are made in 
decimal miles along the linear element from the closest, preceding milepost.  Measuring is done in the 
direction of increasing mileposts which is usually the direction of the linear element. 

In some States in the US, a single set of mileposts are used for both carriageways of a divided highway.  
Mileposts are usually numbered in the north or east predominant direction of the highway  Even if separate 
linear elements are defined for each carriageway, the along measuring is always done in the direction of 



OGC 10-129r1

increasing mileposts, even though this is opposite the direction of the westbound and southbound carriageway 
linear elements. 

Mileposts are one mile apart.  Sometimes reconstruction of a part of a roadway may change its overall length.  
To maintain the milepost spacing of exactly one mile, all posts within as well as those beyond the area of 
reconstruction must be relocated.  This is not always feasible or desirable, especially if the road is hundreds of 
miles in length and the reconstruction occurs near the beginning of the road.  Many times the State will only 
relocate mileposts within the reconstructed area, prorating the reconstructed distance between the number of 
mileposts affected.  The consequence is that they are no longer one mile apart.  This means that the Linear 
Referencing Method henceforth becomes a reference post Linear Referencing Method, requiring knowledge 
of the inter-post spacings. 

Mileposts are owned by a gmllr:Feature linear element.  The milepost location, if specified, shall be 
specified using a gmllr:PositionExpression.  The linear element of this 
gmllr:PositionExpression will be the owning linear element.  The Linear Referencing Method of this 
gmllr:PositionExpression does not have to be milepost.  A milepoint Linear Referencing Method would 
allow locating the milepost a certain number of miles from the start of the linear element (for example, 
milepost 3 would have a distance along equal to 3.0).  Alternatively, a milepost Linear Referencing Method 
could be used to specify the location of the milepost relative to the previous one (here milepost 3 would have 
a from referent of milepost 2 and a distance along of 1.0).  Since all mileposts would have a distance along of 
1.0 from the previous milepost and since they are named by their mileage from the start of the linear element, 
the location does not have to be persisted; it can be implied (milepost 3 is 3.0 miles from the start of the linear 
element that owns it).  (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.3.2). 

An LRM name of ‘kilopost’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is identical to the ‘milepost’ Linear 
Referencing Method except that the gmllr:units is kilometre instead of mile and the 
gmllr:distanceAlong is measured in kilometres.  Kiloposts are exactly one kilometre apart.  If not, it is 
actually a kilometre reference post Linear Referencing Method.  Kilopost locations would be specified by using 
a metric Linear Referencing Method such as kilopoint or kilopost, or would be implicitly inferred by the kilopost 
name. (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.3.3). 

An LRM name of ‘kilometre-post’ designates an alternative name for a ‘kilopost’ Linear Referencing Method 
(see ISO/DIS 19148, C.3.4). 

An LRM name of ‘referencePost’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is similar to the milepost 
Linear Referencing Method except that the reference posts are not necessarily exactly one mile apart.  It is 
therefore necessary to explicitly specify the location (or possibly position) of each reference post.  This can be 
done with a milepoint Linear Referencing Method, specifying their absolute distance along from the beginning 
of the owning gmllr:Feature.  Alternatively, they can be located using a relative reference post Linear 
Referencing Method, locating each reference post a distance along from the previous reference post.  Then, if 
reconstruction occurs, only those reference posts in the reconstruction area which are moved would have to 
have their distance along updated (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.3.5). 

An LRM name of ‘countyMilepoint’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which allows the milepoint value 
to be reset to zero when a highway enters a new County.  If the linear element along which locations are to be 
linearly referenced is a single highway which traverses through many Counties, then this Linear Referencing 
Method is used.  Linearly referenced locations are specified as a distance in miles from where the highway 
enters the County (the from referent). 

If however, the highway changes its identity when it enters the new County (for example, it becomes County 
Route 42) and locations are to be linearly referenced along Route 42, then Route 42 is the linear element and 
a simple milepoint (absolute) Linear Referencing Method is appropriate, since it already starts at zero at the 
County line  (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.3.6). 

An LRM name of ‘crossStreet’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which allows a location to be specified 
at a distance along a linear element, measured in miles from the intersection of one street with the linear

40 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

element in a direction towards the intersection of another street with the linear element (see ISO/DIS 19148, 
C.3.7).  Support for this Linear Referencing Method requires support for Towards Referents (see 9.4). 

An LRM name of ‘controlSection’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which allows the measure value to 
be reset to zero when a highway enters a new Control Section.  If the linear element along which locations are 
to be linearly referenced is a single highway which traverses through multiple Control Sections that are 
defined according to agency specific business rules, then this Linear Referencing Method is used.  Linearly 
referenced locations are specified as a distance in the specified measurement unit from where the highway 
enters the Control Section (the from referent or starting Control Section Anchor Point). 

The philosophy behind the establishment of Control Sections is to distinguish between significant differences 
in road physical characteristics (for example, change from an undivided highway section to a divided highway 
section or vice versa) and/or to limit the length of a measured section of road in order to minimize 
accumulative measure value errors. Control Section begin/end points (Control Section Anchor Points) may be 
established either at topological nodes or at points where the linear element intersects a stable administrative 
boundary (for example, a County boundary). 

If each Control Section is a separate linear element, then any of the absolute Linear Referencing Methods 
(milepoint, kilometre-point) should be used instead (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.3.8). 

In accordance with Linear Referencing Methods having a gmllr:type of ‘interpolative’,  measurements are 
interpolated in accordance with the default length of the linear element (gmllr:measure).   Commonly used 
interpolative Linear Referencing Methods include percentage and normalized.  Interpolative Linear 
Referencing Methods are the only ones which are likely to be used for linear elements of type 
gmllr:DirectedEdge. 

An LRM name of ‘percentage’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are made along 
the linear element from its start and are expressed as the percentage that this is of the total length (or weight) 
of the linear element (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.4.2). 

An LRM name of ‘normalized’ designates a Linear Referencing Method which is identical to the percentage 
Linear Referencing Method except that the measured values range from 0 (zero) to 1 (one) instead of 0 (zero) 
to 100.  A measured value of 0 (zero) represents a location at the start of the linear element and 1 (one) 
represents a location at the end of the linear element. 

Two other Linear Referencing Methods commonly used are stationing and address, though neither is 
addressed in ISO/DIS 19148. 

An LRM name of ‘stationing’ designates the simplest stationing Linear Referencing Method.  It has a 
gmllr:type of absolute and gmllr:units of feet.  A plus sign, "+", is often interjected between the 
hundreds place and the tens place (1+00 is 100 feet).  If station equations are supported, the Linear 
Referencing Method gmllr:name should instead be "stationingWithStationEquations", with a gmllr:type 
of relative; the location of each station equation should be a gmllr:Referent.  There would also be metric 
equivalents, such as "metricStationing" with, for example, 1+000 representing 1 kilometre. 

An LRM name of ‘address’ designates the simplest addressing Linear Referencing Method.  It has a 
gmllr:type of interpolative.  Here the gmllr:distanceAlong would be an address number.  This would 
be interpolated against the minimum and maximum address numbers held by the linear element (typically a 
block).  So, if the block goes from address number 101 through 199, a gmllr:distanceAlong address of 
150 would be half way down the block ((150-101)/(199-101) = 0.5).  More sophisticated address methods 
might accommodate independent address numbering on each side of the street but might require splitting the 
street into two linear elements. 

Linear referencing by address is very approximate and only works for simple addressing schemes.  
Complications such as address numbers containing alpha suffixes, addressing around cul-de-sacs, apartment 
complex addressing, addresses which differ by building floor and addresses assigned in date order preclude 
the use of an address Linear Referencing Method.

In accordance with Linear Referencing Methods having a gmllr:type of ‘localInterpolative’, measurements 
are interpolated locally along a segment of a curve type of linear element bounded by two control points 
having m coordinate values bracketing the distance along measure value.   Commonly used local interpolative 
Linear Referencing Methods include mile measure and kilometre measure.  Support for these Linear 
Referencing Methods requires a linear element of type ‘curve’ (see 9.3.5). 

NOTE Measured ("M") coordinates are described in ISO 19133 (Tracking and navigation), sub-clause 6.5 
("Measured Coordinates"). 

An LRM name of ‘mileMeasure’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where the gmllr:distanceAlong 
measurement is expressed as miles along the linear element.  The exact location is determined by finding the 
two control points along the linear element which have M coordinate values which bracket the 
gmllr:distanceAlong value and then interpolating between these two points based on the length of the 
curve segment between them. 

An LRM name of ‘kilometreMeasure’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where the 
gmllr:distanceAlong measurement is expressed as kilometres along the linear element.  The exact 
location is determined by finding the two control points along the linear element which have M coordinate 
values which bracket the gmllr:distanceAlong value and then interpolating between these two points 
based on the length of the curve segment between them. 

Specification of the above defined Linear Referencing Methods is provided in informative Annex A.

gmllr:LRMTypeType implements ISO 19148 LR_LRMType (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.2.11). 

gmllr:LRMTypeType is a codelist which includes the normative values of Linear Referencing Method types 
from ISO 19148 and also allows for extensions of user-defined Linear Referencing Method type.  Pre-defined 
Linear Referencing Methods types include ‘absolute’ (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.2), ‘relative’ (see ISO/DIS 19148, 
C.3), ‘interpolative’ (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.4) or ‘localInterpolative’ which is common in Geographic 
Information Systems supporting m coordinate values. 

An LRM type of ‘absolute’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are made from the 
start of the linear element being measured, in the direction of the linear element.

An LRM type of ‘relative’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are made from the 
specified from referent location, in the direction of the linear element unless overridden by a towards referent 
in which case the direction is from the from referent towards the towards referent. 

An LRM type of ‘interpolative’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are interpolated 
in accordance with the default length or weight (gmllr:measure) of the linear element.  

An LRM type of ‘localInterpolative’ designates a Linear Referencing Method where measurements are 
interpolated locally along a segment of a curve type linear element bounded by two control points having m

gmllr:ReferentTypeType implements ISO 19148 LR_ReferentType (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.2.15). 

gmllr:ReferentTypeType is a codelist which is the union of an enumeration of pre-defined referent types 
and a pattern for specifying a user-defined referent type.  Allowable types are typically dependent upon the 
Linear Referencing Method.    

A referent type of ‘referenceMarker’ indicates that the referent is a reference marker typically physically 
located in the right of way of the road,  rail or other transportation system.  Usually reference markers are 
initially spaced at a uniform distance along the linear element being measured, though subsequent re-
alignments may result in uneven spacing between the markers.  Specifying their location with a relative Linear 
Referencing Method a distance from the preceding marker minimizes the impact of such changes.  

A referent type of ‘intersection’ indicates that the referent is the location of an intersection specified by the 
referent name.  The intersection location is typically taken as the location of the intersection of the reference 
lines of the streets comprising the intersection and is therefore not necessarily precise or deterministic.   
Physical markers may be installed to remedy this.  The Linear Referencing System should include specific 
rules about how intersection locations are determined if this type of referent is to be permitted.  

A referent type of ‘boundary’ indicates that the referent represents where an administrative or maintenance 
boundary crosses the linear element being measured.  This is typically the first time the boundary crosses the 
linear element.  If the boundary runs along the linear element, it would be the point at which they first become 
collinear.  The Linear Referencing System should include specific rules about how boundaries are handled if 
this type of referent is to be permitted.  If the linear element changes at the boundary as for a County route 
beginning at the County boundary, then the Linear Referencing method is more correctly categorized as 
absolute. 

A referent type of ‘landmark’ indicates that the referent is the location of a physical landmark visible in the field.

gmllr:LinearSRS specifies a Linear Spatial Reference System as a combination of a linear element and a 
Linear Referencing Method, the first two components of a gmllr:PositionExpression. 

The element gmllr:linearElement specifies the linear element being measured.   

The element gmllr:lrm specifies the linear referencing method of measurement.   

This combination of a  linear element and a Linear Referencing Method, identifiable by a gml:id, can be used 
as an SRS.  For example: 

 <gml:Point gml:id="p1" srsName="#LSRS123"> 
  <gml:pos>15.5</gml:pos> 
 </gml:Point>  
 
defines a Point geometry as a distance along (15.5) the linear element encapsulated in LSRS123, measured 
in accordance with the Linear Referencing Method which is also encapsulated in LSRS123: 

 <gmllr:LinearSRS gml:id="LSRS123"> 
  <gmllr:linearElement> 
   <gml:LineString srsName="…" srsDimension="3" gml:id="LS_BH18">

    <gmllr:units uom="m"/> 
   </gmllr:LinearReferencingMethod> 
  </gmllr:lrm> 
 </gmllr:LinearSRS> 
 
Because gml:pos only allows values of type double, relative Linear Referencing Methods would be 
precluded from this short-hand encoding since the distance along would require inclusion of a 
gmllr:referent.

gmllrtr:DualAlongReferent implements ISO 19148 LRTR_DualAlongReferent (see ISO/DIS 19148,

For Linear Referencing Methods having a gmllrtr:type of "relative", the  gmllrtr:DualAlongReferent 
specifies an optional towards referent. 

The optional element gmllrtr:towardsReferent specifies a second location along the 
gmllr:LinearElement to help disambiguate the gmllr:fromReferent and the direction in which the 
measurement is made.  The gmllrtr:towardsReferent overrides the directional sense of the 
gmllr:LinearElement, and may influence the offset direction if an offset is included.  When a 
gmllrtr:towardsReferent is part of a distance expression, the gmllr:distanceAlong value is 
measured along the gmllr:LinearElement, beginning at the location specified by the 
gmllr:fromReferent in the direction towards the gmllrtr:towardsReferent.  A 
gmllrtr:towardsReferent is only appropriate for Linear Referencing Method with towards referent, for 
example, the "cross-street" Linear Referencing Method.

gmllro:LRMWithOffset implements ISO 19148 LRO_LRMWithOffset (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.4.2). 

A gmllro:LRMWithOffset specifies the manner in which measurements are made along (and optionally 
laterally offset from) a linear element. 

The element gmllro:offsetUnits specifies the offset units of measure used by the Linear Referencing

gmllro:LateralOffsetDistanceExpressionType implements ISO 19148  
LRO_LateralOffsetDistanceExpression (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.4.5). 

A gmllro:LateralOffsetDistanceExpressionType specifies a linear referenced measure value which 
may contain a lateral offset value.  It extends the gmllr:DistanceExpressionType with lateral offsets. 

Lateral offsets extend the definition of a position expression to accommodate locations which do not lie 
directly on the linear element, but instead are located some distance horizontally or vertically (or both) from 
the linear element.  The horizontal and vertical distances are measured along a perpendicular from the linear 
element or from an offset referent. 

The optional element gmllro:lateralOffsetExpression specifies the laterally offset distance of the 
distance expression. If  absent, the position is not displaced laterally left or right of the 
gmllr:LinearElement.  A lateral offset expression is only appropriate if the Linear Referencing Method 
allows lateral offsets. 

The optional element gmllro:verticalOffsetExpression specifies the vertically offset distance of the 
distance expression. If  absent, the position is not displaced vertically above or below the 
gmllr:LinearElement.  A vertical offset expression is only appropriate if the Linear Referencing Method 
allows vertical offsets.

gmllr:LateralOffsetExpressionType implements ISO 19148 LRO_LateralOffsetExpression (see 
ISO/DIS 19148, 6.4.6) and LRO_LateralOffsetReferent (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.4.7). 

gmllr:LateralOffsetExpressionType is used to describe the lateral offset for a linearly referenced 
location.  

The lateral offset distance is the measure of the lateral offset of the distance expression.  This is the distance 
left or right of the lateral offset referent (or left or right of the linear element being measured if no lateral offset 
referent is specified) to the position being specified.  A positive (+) value is measured in the direction specified 
by the positive lateral offset direction of the Linear Referencing Method.  A  value of 0 (zero) is to be 
interpreted as not having a lateral displacement from the lateral offset referent (or the linear element being 
measured if no lateral offset referent is specified).  The lateral offset distance is a double value extended with 
three attributes. 

The optional attribute gmllr:uom specifies the units of measure of the double value.  It is of type 
gml:UomIdentifier.  If none is provided, the uom value defaults to the offsetUnits value of the Linear 
Referencing Method. 

The optional attribute gmllr:lateralOffsetReferent indicates the base line for the lateral offset 
measure. 

gmllr:lateralOffsetReferent specifies the lateral offset referent as a character string.  Having only a 
value of "back of curb" for example, allows a location to be specified as 5 feet behind the back of the curb.  
This aides in locating the position in the field without having to measure from the linear element.  The value 
can be a conventional value, such as –L1 or RE from XSP (see ISO/DIS 19148, C.5.2).   

If the curb is represented as a Feature with a spatial representation, the distance that the curb is from the 
linear element being measured is determinate and therefore the exact spatial position of the position 
expression can be calculated.  Because the Feature can have multiple spatial representations, the 
gml:AbstractGeometry, rather than the Feature, is specified.  



OGC 10-129r1

The optional attribute gmllr:featureGeometry is the geometry  of a Feature.  Though the type is 
anyURI, it is expected that the value will be a reference to an already defined gml:AbstractGeometry 
object. 

EXAMPLE The following Linear Referencing Method is Milepoint with lateral offsets measured in feet 
("milepointWithLateralOffsetInFeet" from Annex A).  The distance expression: 

 <gmllr:distanceExpression> 
  <gmllro:LateralOffsetDistanceExpression gml:id="DE002"> 
   <gmllr:distanceAlong>25</gmllr:distanceAlong> 
   <gmllro:lateralOffsetExpression lateralOffsetReferent="back of curb"> 

5 
</gmllro:lateralOffsetExpression> 

  </gmllro:LateralOffsetDistanceExpression> 
 </gmllr:distanceExpression> 
 
would specify a location that is 25 miles along the linear element then offset 5 feet behind the back of curb.

ISO/DIS 19148, 6.4.8) and LRO_VerticalOffsetReferent (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.4.9). 

gmllr:VerticalOffsetExpressionType is used to describe the vertical offset for a linearly referenced 
location.  

The vertical offset distance is the measure of the vertical offset of the distance expression.  This is the 
distance above or below the vertical offset referent (or above or below the linear element being measured if no 
vertical offset referent is specified) to the position being specified.  A positive (+) value is measured in the 
direction specified by the positive vertical offset direction of the Linear Referencing Method.  A value of 0 
(zero) is to be interpreted as not having a vertical displacement from the vertical offset referent (or the linear 
element being measured if no vertical offset referent is specified).  The vertical offset distance is a double 
value extended with three attributes. 

The optional attribute gmllr:uom specifies the units of measure of the double value.  It is of type 
gml:UomIdentifier  If none is provided, the uom value defaults to the offsetUnits value of the Linear 
Referencing Method. 



OGC 10-129r1

The optional attribute gmllr:verticalOffsetReferent indicates the base line for the vertical offset 
measure. 

gmllr:verticalOffsetReferent specifies the vertical offset referent as a character string.  Having only 
a value of "existing ground at lateral offset" for example, allows a location to be specified as 5 feet above the 
existing ground at the lateral offset (for example, back of the curb).  This aides in locating the position in the 
field without having to measure from the linear element.   

If the curb is represented as a Feature with a spatial representation, the height of the curb is determinate and 
therefore the exact spatial position of the position expression can be calculated.  Because the Feature can 
have multiple spatial representations, the gml:Geometry, rather than the Feature, is specified.  

The optional attribute gmllr:featureGeometry is the geometry  of a Feature.  Though the type is anyURI, 
it is expected that the value will be a reference to an already defined gml:AbstractGeometry object.

gmllro:LateralOffsetLinearSRS specifies a Linear Spatial Reference System as a combination of a 
linear element and a Linear Referencing Method With Offset, the first two components of a 
gmllr:PositionExpression. 

The element gmllro:linearElement specifies the linear element being measured.   

The element gmllro:lrm specifies the linear referencing method of measurement.   

This combination of a  linear element and a Linear Referencing Method, identifiable by a gml:id, can be used 
as an SRS.  Lateral and vertical offsets can be accommodated with the following assumptions: 

1) the Linear Referencing Method type is either "absolute" or "interpolative" 

2) the Linear Referencing Method supports offsets 

3) the first double value in gml:pos is the distance along 

4) the second double value in gml:pos, if present, is the offset lateral distance 

5) if an offset vertical distance is present, it is the third double value in gml:pos, thus requiring the presence 
of a (possibly zero valued) offset lateral distance 

6) if multiple positions are required (e.g., for defining a gml:LineString), multiple gml:pos are used 
instead of a gml:posList.

defines a line string geometry for a fence relative to a road centerline.  The road is the locating feature linear 
element encapsulated in LSRS345.  The absolute Linear Referencing Method With Offset called "milepoint 
with offsets in feet", also encapsulated in LSRS345, specifies units for distance along in miles, units for offsets 
in feet, and positive offset measures to the right.  The fence is therefore 35 feet right of the road centerline at a

is 37 feet right of the road centerline at a location 16.2 miles along the road.

gmllrov:VectorOffsetDistanceExpressionType implements ISO 19148  
LROV_VectorOffsetDistanceExpression (see ISO/DIS 19148, 6.5.2). 

A gmllrov:VectorOffsetDistanceExpressionType specifies a linear referenced measure value which 
may contain a vector offset value.  It extends the gmllr:DistanceExpressionType with vector offsets. 

As an alternative to lateral offsets, vector offsets extend the definition of a position expression to 
accommodate locations which do not lie directly on the linear element, but instead are located some distance 
from the linear element specified by a vector.  

The optional element gmllrov:VectorOffsetExpression specifies the vector offset expression of the 
distance expression. If absent, the position is not displaced from the gmllr:LinearElement.  A vector 
offset expression is only appropriate for Linear Referencing Method With Offset.  If a distance expression has 
either a lateral or vertical offset expression, it cannot also have a vector offset expression.

 <complexType name="VectorOffsetExpressionType">

gmllrov:VectorOffsetExpressionType implements ISO 19148 LROV_VectorOffsetExpression (see 
ISO/DIS 19148, 6.5.3) with a minor extension - the cardinality of the offsetVector attribute has been increased 
from [1] to [1..3] to enable the offset direction to be defined in terms of up to three component base offset 
vectors. 

gmllrov:VectorOffsetExpressionType is used to describe the vector offset for a linearly referenced 
location.  

The element gmllrov:offsetVector is the offset vector of the distance expression. This specifies the 
distance and direction of the offset from the linear element being measured to the position being specified. A 0 
(zero) length vector is to be interpreted as not having a vector displacement from the linear element being 
measured.

linear element and a Linear Referencing Method With Offset, the first two components of a 
gmllr:PositionExpression.  It also contains one or more offset vectors to specify the offset reference

The element gmllrov:linearElement specifies the linear element being measured.   

The element gmllrov:lrm specifies the linear referencing method of measurement.   

The element gmllrov:offsetVector specifies the offset vector, that is, the direction in which the offset 
distance will be measured.   

The attribute srsName, inherited from gml:VectorType, specifies the offset vector Coordinate Reference 
System.   

The gmllrov:VectorType extends gml:VectorType with an optional attribute gmllrov:offsetUom, 
which specifies the units of measure of the vector distance.  It is of type gml:UomIdentifier  If none is 
provided, the uom value defaults to the offsetUnits value of the Linear Referencing Method With Offset. 

This combination of a  linear element, a Linear Referencing Method, an offset vector and an optional vector 
CRS referenced by the srsName attribute on the offsetVector element, can be used as an SRS.  Vector 
offsets can be accommodated in gml:pos or gml:posList expressions with the following assumptions: 

1) the Linear Referencing Method type is either "absolute" or "interpolative" 

2) the Linear Referencing Method supports offsets

3) the first double value in gml:pos (or gml:posList) is the distance along the linear element

gmllrov:VectorOffsetLinearSRSType.

Sample gml:Point encodings of the positions P1 to P11 are shown as follows, where the first ordinate in

EXAMPLE 2 Two Offset Vectors 

A basis of two offset vectors v1 and v2 can be used to describe the positions S1 to S11 relative to a linear 
element L2 in the offset reference frame as illustrated in Figure 2. Sample gml:Point encodings of the 
positions S1 to S11 are shown adjacent to the diagram below, where the first ordinate in each gml:pos 
element corresponds to distance along the linear element L2, the second ordinate in each gml:pos element 
corresponds to the component distance along the direction of offset vector v1 and the third ordinate in each 
gml:pos element corresponds to the component distance along the direction of the offset vector v2.

10.2 Clarifications to the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6 and ISO 19123:2006 

Clause 8.10, and the CV_ReferenceableGrid class in Figure 17, of OGC Topic 6 (ISO 19123:2006) assume 
the existence of a coordinate transformation operation, as defined by ISO 19111:2003, by which the 
CV_ReferenceableGrid is referenced. However, this grid may be, and often is, referenced by a concatenated 
coordinate operation, as defined by ISO 19111:2003. 

Of course, multiple coordinate transformations or concatenated operations may exist for the same image, that 
are referenced to more than one other CRS, and/or are referenced to the same other CRS by multiple 
Transformation versions (with different accuracy characteristics).  However, Clause 5.3.10 of Topic 6 requires 
that if a coverage domain is defined in a different coordinate reference system, the domain is different so the 
coverage shall be different.  Therefore, if multiple coordinate transformation or concatenated operations exist 
for the same image range values, these are encoded as different grid coverages. 

10.3 AbstractReferenceableGrid 

A referenceable grid is associated with a transform between grid coordinates and coordinates in an external 
coordinate reference system. Unlike a rectified grid, this transformation is usually not characterised through an 
affine transformation. The grid curves in the external coordinate reference system need not be straight or 
orthogonal, but they should retain a grid topology (i.e. the sets of curves defining the grid network should not 
intersect within themselves). Grid cells may be of different shapes and sizes. 

NOTE 1 Notwithstanding some ambiguity in ISO 19123, a gml:Grid represents a geometry, and is always associated 
with an ‘internal’ grid coordinate system (with integer coordinates and a zero origin). A grid that is also defined in terms of 
an ‘external’ coordinate reference system is a rectified grid (GML 3.2 19.2.3), if there is an affine relationship between the 
internal and external coordinates, or a referenceable grid as specified in this sub-clause otherwise. The external 
coordinate reference system for both these subclasses is provided through the inherited gml:SRSReferenceGroup 
(including the srsName attribute). The use of gml:SRSReferenceGroup for gml:Grid is not defined since it has no 
analogue in ISO 19123. 

In ISO 19123, the external coordinate reference system for a CV_ReferenceableGrid is defined (ISO 19123 8.10.2) 
through an explicit association Coordinate Reference System with role name crs to an ISO 19111 SC_CRS coordinate 
reference system object. For a CV_RectifiedGrid, it is defined implicitly (ISO 19123 8.9.2) as the coordinate reference 
system of the origin. 

NOTE 2 A grid topology is retained automatically through the affine transformation of a RectifiedGrid. 

EXAMPLE Figure 3 shows an example of a referenceable grid. 

 
Figure 3 - ReferenceableGrid example 

The transformation between grid coordinates and ‘external’ coordinates is usually non-affine and may take 
different forms. It may be described analytically (e.g. through parametrised mathematical image rectification 



OGC 10-129r1

models); or it may be provided in a table, for instance, relating the grid points to coordinates in the external 
coordinate reference system [ISO 19123, 8.2.1]. The method of transformation is an implementation detail not 
specified by ISO 19123. 

The encoding of CV_ReferenceableGrid therefore uses an abstract element, 
gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGrid, as the head of a substitution group that may include various 
concrete implementations of the transformation. 

    <complexType abstract="true" name="AbstractReferenceableGridType"> 
        <complexContent> 
            <extension base="gml:GridType"> 
                <sequence> 
                    <element ref="gmlrgrid:gridCRS" minOccurs="0"/> 
                </sequence> 
            </extension> 
        </complexContent> 
    </complexType> 
 
    <element abstract="true" name="AbstractReferenceableGrid" 
        substitutionGroup="gml:Grid" 
        type="gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGridType"/> 
 
The attribute group gml:SRSReferenceGroup inherited from gml:AbstractGeometry shall link the 
referenceable grid to the external coordinate reference system to which it is referenceable (represented in ISO 
19123 as an explicit association Coordinate Reference System with role name crs to an ISO 19111 SC_CRS 
coordinate reference system object). 

The optional gridCRS property is a composition association to the definition of the grid CRS for this 
AbstractReferenceableGrid. This definition should be included here when not otherwise known to all data 
receivers, especially when extended by ReferenceableGridByTransformation which uses a coordinate 
Transformation or Concatenated Operation that references a gridCRS. 

A property type for the gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGrid is also defined: 

    <complexType name="ReferenceableGridPropertyType"> 
        <sequence> 
            <element ref="gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGrid"/> 
        </sequence> 
        <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/> 
        <attributeGroup ref="gml:OwnershipAttributeGroup"/> 
    </complexType> 
 
    <element name="referenceableGridProperty" 
type="gmlrgrid:ReferenceableGridPropertyType"/> 
 

10.4 ReferenceableGridByArray 

The gmlrgrid:ReferenceableGridByArrayType defines a referenceable grid by listing an array of grid 
point locations explicitly, as a sequence of direct positions in a defined sequence order over the grid. It is 
defined as follows: 

    <complexType name="ReferenceableGridByArrayType"> 
        <complexContent> 
            <extension base="gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGridType"> 
                <sequence> 
                    <group ref="gml:geometricPositionListGroup"/> 
                    <element name="sequenceRule" 



OGC 10-129r1 

62 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

                  type="gml:SequenceRuleType"/> 
                </sequence> 
            </extension> 
        </complexContent> 
    </complexType> 
 
    <element name="ReferenceableGridByArray" 
     substitutionGroup="gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGrid" 
     type="gmlrgrid:ReferenceableGridByArrayType"/> 
 
The element group gml:geometricPositionListGroup specifies the array of grid point locations in the 
external coordinate reference system (through either a gml:posList element, or a sequence of gml:pos 
elements or gml:Point objects). The gml:sequenceRule element specifies the sequence order of these 
grid point locations over the grid. 

EXAMPLE The referenceable grid of Figure 4 can be represented by specifying an array of grid point locations 
explicitly as follows (note that coordinates are specified as (Lat, Long) in EPSG 4326): 

    <gmlrgrid:ReferenceableGridByArray gml:id="ex" dimension="2"  
  srsName="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326">

                <gml:high>4 3</gml:high> 
            </gml:GridEnvelope> 
        </gml:limits>

10.5 ReferenceableGridByVectorsType, ReferenceableGridByVectors 

The gmlrgrid:ReferenceableGridByVectorsType defines a referenceable grid by specifying an origin 
and offset vectors, with coefficients that may vary over the grid. This generalises the mechanism used for the 
RectifiedGrid (GML 3.2 19.2.3), which uses offset vectors with implicit scalar (unit) coefficients. 

In fact, a hierarchy of grid types may be represented using this mechanism (Figure 5). A RectifiedGrid 
corresponds to offset vectors with scalar (unit integer) coefficients; an irregular but rectilinear grid corresponds 
to real-valued coefficient vectors; while a completely irregular (curvilinear) grid corresponds to coefficient 
arrays. 

NOTE 1 The latter two cases are both examples of an ISO 19123 CV_ReferenceableGrid. 

NOTE 2 The conceptual hierarchy of Figure 5 is not required by the model presented here, and is different to ISO 
19123, where CV_RectifiedGrid is not regarded as a specialisation of CV_ReferenceableGrid. There may be merit in 
revisiting the relationship between these classes in any future revision of ISO 19123.

grid point indices) 

 
The gml:ReferenceableGridByVectorsType is defined as follows: 

    <complexType name="ReferenceableGridByVectorsType"> 
        <complexContent> 
            <extension base="gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGridType"> 
                <sequence> 
                    <element name="origin" type="gml:PointPropertyType"/> 
                    <element maxOccurs="unbounded" name="generalGridAxis" 
                        type="gmlrgrid:GeneralGridAxisPropertyType"/> 
                </sequence> 
            </extension> 
        </complexContent> 
    </complexType> 
 
 
    <element name="ReferenceableGridByVectors" 
substitutionGroup="gmlrgrid:AbstractReferenceableGrid" 
        type="gmlrgrid:ReferenceableGridByVectorsType"/> 
 
 
The element gmlrgrid:origin represents the origin of the referenceable grid in the external coordinate 
reference system. 

The set of gmlrgrid:generalGridAxis elements provide offset vectors (with corresponding coefficients) 
that together span the (sub-)space containing the convex hull of the referenceable grid. A grid point location in 
the external coordinate reference system is calculated from the sum of the offset vectors from all 
gmlrgrid:generalGridAxis elements weighted by their respective coefficients for the grid point 
concerned. 

The gmlrgrid:GeneralGridAxisType specifies an offset vector and array of coefficients over all grid 
points. Both an element and property-type are defined in order to allow the GML by-reference pattern (GML 
3.2, 7.2.3.3):

The element gmlrgrid:offsetVector specifies a vector in the external coordinate reference system. The 
element gmlrgrid:coefficients specifies a corresponding set of weighting coefficients over the grid 
points. In some cases these coefficients will be uniform along one or more axes of the grid, and for efficiency 
reasons the coefficients need only be specified along those axes on which they vary. The grid axes over 
which the coefficients vary is indicated with the gmlrgrid:gridAxesSpanned element, and the order of the 
coefficients over those grid axes is indicated using the gmlrgrid:sequenceRule element.      

NOTE 1 A referenceable grid with each 'general grid axis' having unit coefficients over one grid axis is equivalent to a 
RectifiedGrid. 

NOTE 2 A referenceable grid with each 'general grid axis' having a coefficient vector (i.e. coefficients varying over just 
one axis of the grid) is 'rectilinear' (i.e. parallel grid lines in the external coordinate reference system). 

NOTE 3 Any referenceable grid may be embedded within a space of dimension greater than, or equal to, its grid 
dimension. For example, a two-dimensional grid may be embedded within a three-dimensional volume – either by lying in 
an oblique plane (Figure 6), or by lying in a surface curved within three dimensions (Figure 7). The latter case is defined 
by specifying three offset vectors. In general, the following constraints apply for any referenceable grid (analogous to 
those for rectified grids, ISO 19123 §8.9.6): 

 (grid dimension) ≤ (number of offset vectors) ≤ (CRS dimension)

ReferenceableGridByTransformation encodes one type of CV_ReferenceableGrid as defined in ISO 19123, 
using a gml:Transformation or gml:ConcatenatedOperation to specify the relationship between positions in the 
grid and corresponding positions in another CRS.   

The choice in ReferenceableGridByTransformation encodes an association to a coordinate Transformation or 
Concatenated Operation that (geo)references this ReferenceableGrid. This Transformation or Concatenated 
Operation shall reference the grid CRS for this gml:AbstractReferenceableGrid, as either its sourceCRS or 
targetCRS. If a grid is referenced to more than one other CRS, or is referenced to the same other CRS by 
multiple Transformation versions, different grids and different coverages shall be used.

A grid coordinate reference system for positions in a ReferenceableGrid that uses a defined coordinate 
system congruent with the coordinate system described by the GridEnvelope and axisLabels of gml:GridType. 
That is, this defined coordinate system shall have the same grid axis positions and origin as the GridEnvelope, 
with the same axisLabels, but need not define the same or any limits on the grid size. In addition to this 
defined coordinate system, a gridCRS shall have a defined datum, whose origin may be a specific grid point in 
a specific quadrilateral grid coverage that uses this gridCRS.  

The gridCRS is a composition association to the definition of the CRS for this AbstractReferenceableGrid. 
This CRS may be a DerivedCRS, EngineeringCRS, ImageCRS, or CompoundCRS.  

NOTE The proposed OGC Best Practices Paper 09-085r1 recommends that this gridCRS always be a 
DerivedCRS. 

10.8 Coverages using ReferencableGrid 

The OGC standard "GML Application Schema – Coverages", version 1.0, OGC document 09-146r1, provides 
an element ReferenceableGridCoverage as a GML implementation of CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage 
where the domain is one of the GML implementations of CV_ReferenceableGrid specified in this clause. Since 
such an element is provided already in that GML application schema for coverages, no new coverage element 
is provided in this standard.

11 Code lists, dictionaries and definitions 

11.1 Overview 

Definition and Dictionary encoding is part of the GML schema as a stop-gap, pending the availability of a 
suitable general purpose dictionary model. Since the GML Dictionary schema was developed, standards on 
this topic within the semantic web community have emerged and matured. In particular best-practice is to 
generally use URIs for referring to items in vocabularies, and RDF (OWL, SKOS) for encoding their 



OGC 10-129r1 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 73 
 

descriptions. The GML dictionary schemas for units of measures and reference systems are implementations 
of specific dictionaries and unaffected by the changes described in this Clause. 

Within GML 3.2 gml:ReferenceType and gml:CodeType are both used to refer to an external item. 
Furthermore, the pattern for using gml:CodeType to refer to a resource identified by URI is not standardized: 
in particular the two-component value codeSpace/value is not consistent with contemporary web practice 
which is to use the URI for referencing. In the context of GML 3.3, the scope of gml:CodeType is clarified to be 
name assignment, not cross-referencing. 

Table 3 lists all clarifications on the use of gml:CodeType in the context of this standard. In the context of the 
GML 3.2 (ISO 19136:2007) conformance classes, gml:CodeType may still be used as specified in that 
standard.

(ISO 19136:2007)

8.2.3.5 CodeType, 
CodeWithAuthorityType 

gml:CodeType is a generalized type to be used for assigning a term, keyword or 
name. 

NOTE Elements with type='gml:CodeType' are used to assign a name to a 
feature or other resource. gml:ReferenceType is used to hold a reference to 
another resource. The use of CodeType to reference code list entries is 
deprecated.  

8.2.4.2 CodeListType, 
CodeOrNilReasonListType 

These types are deprecated. 

15.1 Overview 

15.2.4 Using definitions 
and dictionaries 

21.10 Schemas defining 
dictionaries and definitions 

Certain types of definition are specifically required to support geographic 
information. GML provides encodings for the following: coordinate operations 
and dependent objects (GML 3.2, Clause 12), coordinate reference systems and 
dependent objects (GML 3.2, Clause 12), temporal reference systems (GML 3.2, 
Clause 14), and units of measure (GML 3.2, Clause 16). The elements 
gml:Definition and gml:Dictionary provide a common basis for the GML definition 
types and collections.  

The GML Schema for definitions and dictionaries was previously used for generic 
definitions and code lists but is now deprecated for these purposes. 

NOTE Definitions provided by external authorities may already be packaged 
for delivery in various ways, both online and offline. In order that they may be 
referred to from GML documents it is merely necessary that a URI be available to 
identify for each definition. Applications that do not have existing dictionaries, 
vocabularies or ontologies may choose any suitable encoding. Semantic web 
representations based on the RDF model should be considered for new 
dictionaries, or to encode existing dictionaries in a form compatible with 
contemporary web technologies.

Table E.1 — Schema 
encoding overview 

A <<CodeList>> is by default converted to an external dictionary, within which 
each item is identified by a URI. An alternative mapping is a union of an 
enumeration and a pattern. 

NOTE This changes the default conversion for code lists. 

E.2.4.9 UML classes 
(code lists) 

The conversion of a UML class with stereotype <<CodeList>> and with a tagged 
value "asDictionary" with the value "false" is unchanged. 

If a UML class with stereotype <<CodeList>> is without a tagged value 
"asDictionary", or carries a tagged value "asDictionary" with the value "true", the 
code list shall be represented by an external dictionary, vocabulary or ontology, 
using any suitable syntax or encoding.  

EXAMPLE The code list "ParcelUsage" from Figure E.3 may be represented in 
RDF (Turtle syntax) as: 

@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>. 

<http://www.someorg.de/cl/ParcelUsage> a skos:ConceptScheme; 

 skos:prefLabel " Parcel Usage"; 

 skos:hasTopConcept <http://www.someorg.de/cl/ParcelUsage/1>;

 skos:prefLabel "sea, river"; 

 skos:inScheme <http://www.someorg.de/cl/ParcelUsage>. 

In an instance document the reference would then be encoded (using 
gml:ReferenceType as the content model, see GML 3.2, E.2.4.11) for example 
as:  

<usage xlink:href="http://www.someorg.de/cl/ParcelUsage/1"/> 

The value of the xlink:href attribute is the URI for the dictionary item.  

E.2.4.11 UML attributes 
and association roles 

A UML attribute whose type is a class stereotyped <<Enumeration>> is be 
mapped to an element with a string value (value domain: values of the 
enumeration).  

EXAMPLE 6 The enumeration "BuildingStatus" would be represented as:  

 <element name="condition" type="ex:BuildingStatusType"/>  

Depending on the encoding of the class (GML 3.2, E.2.4.9), a UML attribute 
whose type is a class stereotyped <<CodeList>> is mapped to an element with 
either a reference to the corresponding dictionary entry (type 
gml:ReferenceType) or a string value (value domain: values of the code list). A 
value for the name of the code list may be provided using an appinfo annotation 
element gmlexr:targetCodeList.  

 <element name="targetCodeList" type="string"/> 

EXAMPLE 7 The code list "BuildingType" would be represented as:  

 <element name="type" type="gml:ReferenceType"> 

    <annotation> 

       <appinfo> 



OGC 10-129r1 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 77 
 

          <gmlexr:targetCodeList>BuildingType</gmlexr: targetCodeList > 

       </appinfo> 

    </annotation> 

 </element>  

if asDictionary="true" or  

 <element name="type" type="ex:BuildingTypeType"/> 

if asDictionary="false". 

F.2.1.2.9 Code lists Code-list-valued properties may be qualified with an appInfo annotation (element 
gmlexr:targetCodeList) specifying that the referenced item in an xlink:href 
attribute of the property is a value in an external code list dictionary. The value of 
the annotation element is the name of the code list.

12.3 Association class conversion rule 

12.3.1 Overview 
Standard UML modelling allows for an association to have properties, in the form of an association class. 
These can be converted into an "intermediate" class, which may then be serialized using the standard UML-
to-GML encoding rule.  

An association class may be mapped into an equivalent intermediate class. See Figure 10 and Figure 11.

Requirement http://www.opengis.net/spec/GML/3.3/req/assocClass/transform 

Before applying the GML encoding rule, any UML association class shall be transformed 
as follows (in the following description the source class of the association is called S and 
the target class is called T): 

- The association class A is transformed into a regular class with the same name, 
stereotype, tagged values, constraints, attributes, relationships. 

- The association is replaced by two associations, one from S to A ("SA") and one from 
A to T ("AT"). 

- The characteristics of the association end (in particular role name, navigability, 
multiplicity, documentation) of the original association class at T are used for 
association ends at A of SA and at T of AT with the exception that the multiplicity at 
the association end at T of association AT is set to 1.  

- The characteristics of the association end of the original association class at S are 
used for association ends at S of SA and at A of AT with the exception that the 
multiplicity at the association end at S of association SA is set to 1.

standard encoding rule. 
Requirement http://www.opengis.net/spec/GML/3.3/req/exr/ext 

 

Any extended GML encoding rule referenced from a GML application schema may extend 
the standard GML encoding rule with the following: 

 A new stereotype in the UML profile associated with a classifier, an attribute, an 
association role or package.  

o A new stereotype shall only be introduced, if the concept described by the 
stereotype is not encoding specific but relevant on the conceptual level. 

o Schema conversion rules shall be specified defining how XML Schema 
documents shall be derived from UML model elements with the stereotype. 

 A new tagged value in the UML profile associated with a classifier, an attribute, an 
association role or package. 

o A new tagged value shall describe a concept that is specific to the GML 
encoding. 

o The name of the tagged value shall use a lowerCamelCase name starting 
with "gmlext".  

o Schema conversion rules shall be specified defining how XML Schema 
documents shall be derived from UML model elements with the tagged value. 

 A schema conversion rule for instances of GF_Constraint. 
o The schema conversion rule shall not convert the constraint to XML Schema, 

but to a separate language. 
EXAMPLE Schematron is a language to specify constraints.

Annex A Linear referencing method examples (informative) 

Overview 

This informative annex includes a collection of typical Linear Referencing Methods, many of which are in ISO 
19148 Appendix C. The list of methods is taken from the Linear Referencing Methods explained in 9.3.17. 

The units are encoded using the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). The units are: 

 "m": metre 
 "hm": hectometre 
 "km": kilometre 
 "[mi_i]": international mile (same as the US mile and the British mile) 
 "[ft_i]": international feet (same as US feet and British feet) 
 "{addressNumber}": Indicates that the value is an address number, i.e. not a physical unit. In UCUM, 

text in curly brackets are annotations.
