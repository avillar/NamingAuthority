Introduction 

Image Handling is a thread in the OGC Web Services 1.2 (OWS1.2).  This document 
defines the system design for Image Handling in OWS1.2.  The system design responds 
to the requirements in [1]1.  The system design specifies two main services: Image 
Archive Service and Image Catalogue Service.  Interfaces for these two services are 
defined using previously defined OWS service interfaces.

OGC 04-051 

Note: definition based on MD_Georectified of ISO 19115 and general principles of ISO definitions - the template 
refers to ISO 19104 - that a definition cannot be multiple sentences.  Changed initial “geospatial data” to “coverage”. 

georeferenced gridded coverage 
coverage with a gridded domain whose cells are irregularly spaced in any geographic or 
map coordinate system and can be geolocated using geolocation information supplied 
with the data but not from the grid properties alone  

Note: definition adapted from ISO 19115 definition of MD_Georeferenceable. Changed initial “geospatial data” to 
“coverage”. 

ungeoreferenced gridded coverage 
coverage with a gridded domain whose cell geographic coordinates cannot be determined  

Note: Ungeorectified is redundant; if it can't be gelocated it is by definition ungeorectified. The key point isn't lack of 
accompanying information; it's lack of any information.

Figure 1— UML notation 

In Figure 1, the following three stereotypes of UML classes are used: 

a) <<Interface>> A definition of a set of operations that is supported by objects having 
this interface.  An Interface class cannot contain any attributes. 

b) <<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent 
existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no 
operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information. 

c) <<CodeList>> is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of 
potential values. 

5.2.2 UML Dynamic Model 

The diagrams that appear in this document are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) dynamic structure diagram.  The UML notations used in this document 
are described in the diagram below. 

To represent dynamic models in this document, UML sequence diagrams are used.  A 
sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence.  In particular it 
shows the objects participating in an interaction and the sequence of messages 
exchanged. 

A sequence diagram has two dimensions: the vertical dimension represents time; the 
horizontal dimension represents objects participating in the interaction.  Often, only the

sequence of messages is important, but in real-time applications, the time axis can be an 
actual metric.  There is no significance to the horizontal ordering of the objects. 

6 Image Handling System Design 

6.1 Overview 

The main services of the Image Handling system design are the Image Archive and the 
Image Catalogue.  An Image Archive provides persistence storage of images and 
associated metadata.   An Image Catalogue provides persistence storage of image 
metadata.  The Image Archive and the Image Catalogue implement interfaces defined in 
other OWS services. 

6.2 OWS Interfaces Applicable to Image Handling 

OGC has previously defined several key interfaces, e.g., Web Coverage Service.  The 
design for Image Handling in OWS1.2 is accomplished through reuse of OGC interfaces.  
This section introduces the interfaces and indicates any requirements particular to the 
image handling design.  Subsequent sections provide the image handling design using 
these interfaces. 

6.2.1 WCS Interface 

The Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports the networked interchange of geospatial data 
as "coverages" containing values or properties of geographic locations. WCS provides 
access to intact (unrendered) geospatial information, as needed for client-side rendering, 
multi-valued coverages, and input into scientific models and other clients beyond simple 
viewers.  WCS as defined in [2] defines one interface with three operations as shown here 
in Figure 2. 

«interface»
WCS

getCapabilities
getCoverage
describeCoverageType

 
Figure 2 — WCS Interface  

(note describeCoverageType was changed to describeCoverage in WCS version 1.0) 

Requirements specific to Image Handling [1] that may be above and beyond those 
currently designed in the WCS interface are as follows3:

5.2.2 Image categories 
5.2.3 Image types 
5.2.4 Image sizes and formats 
5.2.5 Image metadata structure 
5.2.8 Web service interfaces 

The paragraph number from [1] is indicated in the list above. 

Design Issue:  Potential changes to the WCS interface to meet Image Handling needs 
have been identified and are discussed below: 

- Allow retrieving a useful subset of a grid coverage that is georeferenced (and thus not 
georectified).   

The getCoverage request allows specifying what Coordinate Reference System is used in 
the request.  It needs to be clarified that the “request CRS” may be in a ground CRS 
and/or in an image CRS.  For the case of a ground CRS in the request posed against a 
coverage that has a georeferenced coverage (e.g. native coverage CRS is not 
geographic), some coverage servers may be able to convert to the request CRS into the 
native CRS and respond to the getCoverage.  Also, some servers may support a 
getCoverage request CRS that is the image CRS native to the coverage, in which case the 
request can be processed.  These cases for georeferenced data have begun to be clarified 
in the WCS Request For Comment process.  (In Abstract Specification Topic 2 (document 
01-102), image pixels are located in an image coordinate reference system (which is a 
specified specialization of an engineering coordinate reference system). The XML 
schema for this, in document 02-036r3, uses the XML element named ImageCRS).  

(The design issue listed above, now with strikethrough font, was addressed in WCS1.0 
which allows for a getCoverage request in a georeferenced CRS, e.g., image 
coordinates.) 

- WCS response might provide result that optionally includes metadata describing the 
coverage subset actually returned. 

 The GetCoverage operation sometimes returns a somewhat different subset of the grid 
coverage, than is directly specified in the GetCoverage request. When that occurs, the 
client needs to receive metadata describing the coverage subset actually returned. 
Suppose that you are requesting a format that returns 3 payloads in the message (3 bands 
in separate file for example). Metadata is needed about the role of each payload in the 
message. Note the problem is also raised for transaction. The metadata can be sent as an 
attachment to the message.  Multi-part messages was investigated in OWS as reported in 
[8]. 

- Need to clarify handling of identifiers for coverages that are retrieved from a catalog 
(and not contained in a Capabilities document).  

6 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved
 



OGC 04-051 

Every image stored with WOS will have a unique identifier.  That unique identifier is 
assigned by the archive when the coverage is input.  Once the identifier is obtained by the 
user via WRS, it is used in the GetCoverage request.  The WCS LayerID could be 
redefined to be the coverage unique identifier, with a URI value, suggest changing this 
parameter name to "CoverageURI" or something similar. 

- Need to allow handling video images (timed sequence of non-georectified grid 
coverages), with different georeferencing and footprint for each frame.   

This case was part of the UAV portion of the OWS1.2 Demostration.  For more details 
see Image Archive Service Implementation DIPR (reference [7]). 

- May need to adapt Filter Encoding for use in a GetCoverage request.   

Need to specify the requirements that would require Filter Encoding as this is not a 
trivial change.  Most coverage access is via rectangular "slices" --particularly when 
dealing with the grid case. When considering other kinds of coverages, priorities may 
change. May define new operators in the Filter that operate on the range that allows to 
navigate in the N-dimensional range space. 

6.2.2 WMS Interface 

A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of georeferenced data. A "map" is a visual 
representation of geodata; a map is not the data itself. WMS as defined in [5] contains 
one interface with three operations shown here in Figure 3.

WMS

getCapabilities
getMap
getFeatureInfo

 
Figure 3 — WMS Interface 

 

6.2.3 WRS Interfaces 

The Web Registry Service (WRS) provides interfaces for querying and managing a 
metadata repository. A registry service is a web services profile of the OpenGIS Catalog 
Interface Implementation Specification. The Web Registry Service (WRS) as defined in 
[3] defines six interfaces of which three interfaces are used here.    The relevant WRS 
interfaces for image handling are shown in Figure 4

Requirements specific to Image Handling [1] that may be above and beyond those 
currently designed in the WRS interfaces are as follows5:

5.2.3 Image types 
5.2.4 Image sizes and formats 
5.2.5 Image metadata structure 
5.2.6 Multiple servers, para. (a) 
5.2.8 Web service interfaces 

The paragraph number from [1] is indicated in the list above. 

Query refinement is a key capability as there may be millions of images in the catalogs 
and archives.   

Design Issue: During the OWS1.2 the topic of query refinement was discussed, but it was  
unresolved how the query will be persisted between getRecord operations.  It shall not be 
requirement of the actor to persist or recreate the query. 

6.2.4 WOS Interface 

The Web Object Service (WOS) provides operations for the  management and access to 
generic objects that do not require a specialized interface.  The WOS as defined in [4] 
contains one interface and five operations shown here in Figure 5

5.2.4 Image sizes and formats 
5.2.5 Image metadata structure 
5.2.8 Web service interfaces 

The paragraph number from [1] is indicated in the list above. 

Reference [8] defines a messaging framework to conduct communications between OGC 
web services. It is independent of any transport protocol and any messaging encoding. 
The OGC Messaging Framework was used to support insert of image packages using 
WOS.  Information in addition to the image itself needs to be inserted and retrieved from 
the image archive.  OMF provides a method to define an package of imagery and 
associated information suitable for transfer via OGC Web Services. 

6.2.5 OWS Common Interface 

OWSCommon defines operations that are common to all OWS services. The 
OWSCommon getCapabilities operation is used to request the capability profile for a 
service; this operation is the common mechanism by which any OWS service describes 
itself.  The OWS Common Interface contains one operation as shown here in Figure 6

6.3 Interface Reuse for Image Handling 

6.3.1 OWS Service Composition 

The OWS 1.2 Common Architecture [6] defines three methods for defining a service that 
reuses multiple interfaces.  The Image Archive Service and the Image Catalogue are 
defined using the Service Composition method for interface reuse. 

In service composition interfaces presently implemented by two or more existing services 
are combined to form a new service. The getCapabilities is  implemented once in the new 
service, but provides information about all of the capabilities and content of the new 
service. In the case of service composition, the interfaces composing the new service 
might have no independent existence. 

6.3.2 Image Handling Interfaces 

Interfaces for the Image Archive and for the Image Catalogue are defined through service 
composition using the interfaces defined in the previous section. Figure 7 provides a 
UML model showing the realization of interfaces in the image archive and image 
catalogue class.  Table 1 provides a summary of which interfaces are mandatory, optional 
or not used in the Image Archive and Image Catalogue for OWS1.2.

portrayal requirements, if such operation(s) are specified: 

5.3.6 Get coverage (optional) The image archive function interface(s) shall 
provide one or more operations that together meet the coverage data 
retrieval following requirements: 

 

Design issue: Should the Image Catalog and Image Archive services include 
WRS:lockRecord and/or WOS:lockObject operations? The answer might be different for 
an Image Catalog and for an Image Archive.  In considering these design questions, the 
following questions arise: 

1. What client actions on an object (or record) are prohibited by a lock (not held by that 
client). For example, are GetObject and GetSingleObject prohibited on a locked object? 

2. When would a lockRecord operation be used on an Image Catalog? When would 
inputting a new version that supersedes the previous version not work, or not be 
preferable? What is the use case(s) for catalog record locking? 

3. When would a lockObject operation be used on an Image Archive? When would 
inputting a new version that supersedes the previous version not work, or not be 
preferable? What is the use case(s) for archive object locking? 

 

6.4 Image Archive and Catalogue Relationships 

Two additional classes are shown in Figure 8: Image Source and Image Client.  The 
Image Source inserts imagery metadata into the Image Archive and may insert metadata 
into the Catalogue. The Image client can search either the catalogue or the archive to 
discover images of interest.  The Image Client accesses the image archive for full or 
partial images.

Figure 8 — Class Diagram: Image Handling Relationships 
 

Through the relationships shown in Figure 8, the following image handling requirements 
are met (note that the paragraph numbers are from [1]): 

5.2.6 Multiple servers a) The archiving and cataloging functions shall use 
interfaces and metadata that, when implemented by different web server 
instances, shall allow multiple catalog services to easily work with 
multiple archive services. 

5.2.6 Multiple servers b) One catalog server instance shall be able to handle 
metadata for data handled by multiple archive server instances, when 
those servers are separately implemented. 

5.2.6 Multiple servers c) Multiple catalog server instances shall be able to 
handle metadata for different data handled by one archive server instance, 
when those servers are separately implemented. In addition, multiple 
catalog server instances should be able to handle metadata for the same 
data handled by one archive server instance. 

Note that for OWS1.2, two methods for managing metadata are under study: 

1) The Image Source supplies metadata to one or more Image Archives and to 
one or more Image Catalogs.  In this first case, the Image Source is responsible 
for consistency of metadata between the catalogue and archive.   

2) The Image Source supplies metadata to one or more Image Archive.  The 
Image Archive supplies metadata to the Image Catalog.  In this second case the 
Image Archive is responsible for updating the Image Catalogue. 

It is recognized that other metadata management approach are possible, i.e., this is not an 
exhaustive list of metadata management approaches. 

14 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved
 



OGC 04-051 

Design Issue: Multiple approaches to metadata management. Two approaches for 
metadata management are described in this design.  The approaches are not mutually 
exclusive and may both be required based on enterprise operational policies.  For 
example, the OWS 1.2 RFQ mentions a potential time delay between when a new image is 
submitted to the archive and when it is available from the archive service for downloads. 
Assuming that the registry/catalog can bring the metadata on-line sooner than the IAS 
can bring the image on-line, the potential for making imagery requests before they can be 
processed seems to be significant. 

If the Image Archive (automatically) inputs search metadata into Image Catalogs, 
additional requirements can be derived from the requirements stated in Subclause 5.2.5 
of [1].  These derived requirements on the interface designs tentatively include: 

1. An Archive shall automatically input search metadata into a set of one or more 
Catalogs whenever new or modified data is input into that Archive. An Archive should 
also be able to automatically input search metadata into a set containing zero Catalogs. 

2. An Archive should allow a client (Image Client or Image Source) to initiate automatic 
input of search metadata into a set of one or more additional Catalogs for data 
previously input into that Archive. 

3. An Archive shall use information from the client specifying the set of Catalogs into 
which to automatically input search metadata. This set of Catalogs shall be allowed to be 
different for each new data set that is input into that Archive. 

4. An Archive shall automatically remove or deprecate search metadata from all the 
Catalogs into which it put search metadata whenever the previously input data is 
removed or deprecated from that Archive. 

Consider using the registerResourcee: 

'push' through the transaction() operation, specifying the appropriate data manipulation 
commands (insert, update, delete) with included registry objects. This operation can be 
invoked by a dedicated registry client or perhaps by another service functioning as a 
client.  

'pull' through the registerResource() operation your 'manual' mode seems to be 'push' 
through a dedicated registry client that presents a user-friendly interface 

 

6.5 Image Archive Service 

In order to support the interfaces identified above, the Image Archive will provide 
services on the imagery that are not uniquely defined simply by responding to the 
interfaces.  For example some Image Archives will provide access to images in 
coordinate reference system (CRS) other than the native CRS of the image when it is

OGC 04-051 

inserted in the archive, e.g., the archive may rectify the imagery based on metadata 
provided with the image.  An archive may compute statistics on the images, e.g., 
histogram, and supply that as metadata – metadata that was not provide on the insert.  
These services will be variable by implementation and there has been no agreement in the 
testbed as to mandatory value-added services provided by image archive service.   

In addition to supporting the interfaces listed in Table 1, an Image Archive must provide 
persistent storage.   No other service is specifically required of an Image Archive.  An 
example Image Archive is shown in Figure 9.  The example provides an InsertManager 
that may perform checks on an inserted image, may compute image statistics, and may 
provide some measure of transaction management in placing an image package in the 
PersistentStorage.  The level of query against the metadata in the archive will vary and 
may include queries against the image data, i.e., data mining.  To satisfy the getCoverage 
operation the Image Archive may provide coordinate transformation and interpolation 
services providing images that differ from the inserted image to meet image client needs.  
The variation of services provided by an Image Service will vary by implementation.

7.1 Search / discover image metadata 

An actor uses an Image Client to search for images of interest, i.e., that are fit to the users 
use.  The search can be done against an Image Catalog (see Figure 10) or an Image

OGC 04-051 

Archive (see Figure 11).  The interaction patterns are similar but the search results may 
differ.  An Image Catalog may search metadata for images from multiple archives either 
because the Catalog contains the metadata or the Catalog propagates a distributed search.  
The records returned from a query include a URL for image type description document.

Discussion about the registry interface: 

Question: how do I reuse a Registry response in a subsequent GetCoverage request? 

© OGC 2004 – All rights reserved 17
 



OGC 04-051 

o Answer: Registry gives you a URL; you can reuse that URL as a layer name 
in GetCoverage.  A Design Issue remains whether the registry returns parts of 
the request that would be valuable in creating the getCoverage request. 
Therefore when the client uses the URL against the archive for access it may 
need to insert that information, eg. Bounding box in getCoverage request. 

Question: How do I associate a particular piece of data with the appropriate operations 
needed to access it? (More specifically: how does the registry tell me to use GetCoverage 
for access to particular imagery?) 

o Answer: The registry lists services, data, and associations between them. So 
you can search on data, and then find services that give you access to that 
data. (Or vice-versa) 

Question: If I make a spatially-bounded registry search, should the registry give me 
complete (e.g., GetCoverage) data-access requests instead of just reporting data and their 
associations with services?  

o Answer: that would definitely be value-added functionality – above and 
beyond the expected functions of a registry. 

 

7.2 Fetch whole images 

This sequence assumes that the Actor has an identifier for an image.  The Actor uses the 
Image Client to retrieve the entirety of the image.  The Image Client may then process the 
image producing some result for the Actor, e.g, calculate statistics about the image, or 
render the image on a display.

7.4 Insert new image: Source manages metadata 

This is the first of two approaches to of inserting an image in an archive.  In this first 
approach, the Image Source is responsible for putting the metadata in one or more Image 
Catalogs after the image is in an Image Archive.

7.6 Add image metadata to existing image 

This sequence allows for update of the metadata after an image is in an archive.  For 
example an analyst may discover an image, review the image and determine some quality 
attribute about the image.  This sequence provides for the analyst to add metadata to the 
existing metadata in a catalog. 

Design Issue: discussion is needed about metadata management for this sequence.  
Which metadata store does the client update: catalog or archive?  Which service is 
responsible for metadata management: Image Client, Image Catalog, Image Archive?  
Only one option is shown here.
