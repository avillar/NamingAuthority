i. Preface 

The OGC Catalogue Services 2.0 specification (OGC 04-021r3) establishes a general 
framework for implementing catalogue services that can be applied to meet the needs of 
stakeholders in a wide variety of domains. 

The ebRIM application profile is based on the HTTP protocol binding described in 
Clause 10 of the Catalogue 2.0 specification; it qualifies as a ‘Class 2’ profile under the 
terms of ISO 19106 since it includes extensions permitted within the context of the base 
specifications, some of which are not part of the ISO 19100 series of geomatics 
standards. The ebRIM application profile also includes a Basic extension package of the 
OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM) providing artefacts of general 
utility in the geomatics domain. 

This specification complements the ebRIM application profile of CS-W for the 
cataloguing of ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 compliant metadata record. It defines for this 
purpose a Core ISO Metadata extension package of ebRIM. 

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 05-008], 
which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 
to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this specification.

Introduction 

The target audience for this document includes client and service developers, system 
testers, and users who want to acquire a deeper understanding of catalogue services. The 
specification encompasses three interrelated views that reflect different viewpoints on a 
catalogue service. Each viewpoint2  focuses on different areas of concern: 

• Enterprise – describes the general capabilities of the service in light of functional and 
non-functional requirements (for catalogue users and system testers); 

• Information – defines the kinds of information handled by the catalogue and the 
policies to be enforced (for catalogue users, developers, and testers); 

• Computational – specifies the public interfaces, allowable interactions, and protocol 
bindings (for developers and testers). 

This document extends the ebRIM application profile of CS-W for the cataloguing of 
ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 compliant metadata. 

The terms ‘catalogue’ and ‘registry’ are often used interchangeably, but the following 
distinction is made in this application profile: a registry is a specialized catalogue that 
exemplifies a formal registration process such as those described in ISO 19135 or ISO 
11179-6. A registry is typically maintained by an authorized registration authority who 
assumes responsibility for complying with a set of policies and procedures for accessing 
and managing registry content. This profile does not stipulate any particular registration 
policies that must be enforced by a conforming implementation.

                                                 

2 The Reference Model of  Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP, ISO/IEC 10746) is the architectural framework 
adopted by the OGC and ISO/TC 211 for specifying software-intensive systems. In IEEE 1471 terminology the RM-
ODP framework provides a set of library viewpoints.

OGC® Cataloguing of ISO Metadata (CIM) 

Using the ebRIM profile of CS-W 

1 Scope 

A catalogue implementation that conforms to this specification provides facilities for 
discovering and advertising information resources described through ISO 19115 and ISO 
19119 compliant metadata records, with a specific focus on geospatial dataset, dataset 
collections and services. For this purpose, this specification extends the general and flexible 
catalogue information model, adding dedicated kinds of artifacts for the specific management 
of the targeted information resources. These artifacts includes, but are not limited to service 
offers, interface definitions, dataset descriptions, application schemas, and classification 
schemes. As any service complaint with the ebRIM profile of CS-W, it may be used to 
catalogue resources located in both local and remote repositories. Representations of these 
resources are exchanged using the standard HTTP/1.1 protocol. 

2 Conformance 

Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified by 
the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A (normative). The framework, concepts, and 
methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in 
ISO 19105: Geographic information — Conformance and Testing. 

In addition to satisfying the requirements stipulated in all normative clauses and Annex A, a 
catalogue implementation must also satisfy all relevant requirements in the following base 
specifications: 

• OGC Catalogue Services 2.0, Clause 10 (OGC 04-021r3, with Corr. 1) 
• OGC Web Services Common Specification 1.0 (OGC 05-008) 
• OGC Filter Encoding Implementation Specification 1.1 (OGC 04-095) 
• OASIS ebXML Registry Information Model, Version 3.0 
• OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W (OGC 05-025)

6 System context 

6.1 Application domain 

A metadata repository managed by a catalogue implementing this application profile deals 
with ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 compliant metadata with a specific focus on geospatial data, 
geospatial services and geospatial applications. This document does not attempt to specify a 
general-purpose catalogue. Rather, it allows the retrieval and management of the metadata 
objects referred to above. 

This application profile has no specific disciplinary focus. All communities working with 
these sorts of geospatial information are addressed. Typical communities are surveying, 
environment, geology, landscaping, water management, power industry, telecommunications 
etc. 

The intention is to implement the generally understood ISO19115/19119 information model 
based on the meta-model as defined in ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W. It should 
model at most as many ebRIM RegistryObjects as required to be able to provide the most 
important use-cases for discovery needed by the communities above-named.  

This specification is based on the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) 
profile [OGC 05-025]. The essential capabilities of a catalogue service within a service-
oriented architecture are described in clause 6.1 of the profile.

6.2 Essential use cases 

This section describes essential use cases for the purpose of demonstrating typical interactions 
between users, as well as a catalogue service that supports the specified application profile.

Figure 1: Overall system use cases 

An actor is a person, organisation, or external system that plays a role in one or more 
interactions with the system. Five actors are identified: 

Metadata Author (not depicted on the overview figure): The metadata author is responsible 
for creating ISO 19139-compliant metadata records on geographic resources. The metadata 
author acts for the organization responsible for the resource.  

Metadata Editor: Software tool enabling the edition of ISO 19139 metadata 

Repository Publisher: The repository publisher publishes the ISO 19139-compliant metadata 
records to the repository. The responsible individuals in the organization can thus access and 
maintain these metadata records. 

Registry Publisher: The registry publisher publishes CIM-compliant descriptions of the ISO 
19139-compliant metadata records to the ebRIM Registry through the catalogue service. By 
doing so, he enables the discovery of these description records by a requestor entity.  

Requestor: This actor searches through a catalogue service for metadata descriptions and 
accesses ISO 19139 metadata records in the repository. Depending on the context of the 
catalogue service implementation, the requestor can be a member of the responsible 
organization or an external individual. 

Repository: The repository stores ISO 19139 metadata records. 

Catalogue Service: This is a system that handles the discovery and publishing of metadata 
entries. Furthermore, this actor has the ability to harvest metadata records from other

OGC 07-038 

repositories. The catalogue service stores metadata descriptions in its registry. These metadata 
descriptions are connected to the corresponding ISO 19139 records in the repository.  

 

The following sections describe the use cases in more detail.

Figure 2: Publish metadata 

Description: Two distinct and independent functionalities of the system are clearly identified. 
The first one deals with the management of metadata and metadata records of the resources 
produced by an organization. The metadata author describes geo-resources by applying 
ISO/TS19139. A geo-resource may be a service, a geodataset (single or collection) or an 
application. The repository publisher then publishes these records to a repository; they can 
then be managed by the organization. The metadata author and repository publisher act for the 
producing organization. 

The second functionality concerns the cataloguing of metadata records that enables their 
discovery by users. To achieve this, the registry publisher publishes descriptions of the 
metadata records to a registry through the catalogue service. In order to give the user access to 
the full metadata records stored in the repository, the registry publisher links the descriptions 
of the catalogue to the appropriate items of the repository. By doing so, he gives a requestor 
access to descriptions of metadata records in the registry and to the full ISO 19139 metadata 
records in the repository.  

Pre-conditions: The repository publisher knows the URL of the repository and has the right 
to access the repository. The registry publisher knows the URL of the catalogue service, has

OGC 07-038 

knowledge about the transaction interface, has the right to access the catalogue service and 
has the right to link the catalogue objects to the repository items.  

Post-conditions: The ISO 19139 metadata record is either successfully published to the 
repository or publishing fails due to a non-valid metadata record. A CIM-compliant 
description of the ISO 19139 metadata record is then either successfully published to the 
catalogue and a link is created to the corresponding repository item or publishing fails due to 
a non-valid metadata description.

Figure 3: Discover metadata 
Description: A requestor discovers metadata entries and then accesses specific ISO 19139 
metadata records one at a time through the operations provided by the catalogue service. If a 
service is discovered that fits his search terms, he can bind to this service in accordance with 
the information in the result sets of the catalogue service. Depending on the context of the 
catalogue service implementation, the requestor can be a member of the responsible 
organization or an external individual. 

Pre-conditions: The requestor knows the location of the catalogue service.  

Post-Condition: The requestor receives a valid catalogue response (due to a valid request) 
with a result set that contains all the information that fits the requestor’s query or the full ISO 
19139 metadata record stored in the repository.

updated. Brief representations of all modified records are returned to the client when 
processing is complete. 

Pre-conditions: The repository resources are ISO 19139-compliant. The repository resources 
must be accessible over a network. 

Post-Condition: If the request is processed successfully, the metadata descriptions 
corresponding to the ISO 19139 metadata record is inserted into the registry and are available 
immediately in case of an adequate query. 

7 Information models 

7.1 Capability classes 

This specification adopts the capability classes defined in clause 6.5 of the OGC Catalogue 
Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025]. 

7.2 Catalogue information model 

7.2.1 ebXML registry information model (ebRIM) 

7.2.1.1 Principles 

This specification adopts the general description of the ebXML registry information model 
(ebRIM) provided in clause 6.2 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) 
profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025]. The concept of repository item and extension package 
respectively described in clauses 6.3 and 6.4 of this application profile, are also fully relevant. 

7.2.1.2 Management of spatial references 

The statements expressed in clause 7.5 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 
15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] relatively to the management of spatial references in 
ebRIM are applicable. 

7.2.2 CIM ebRIM information model 

A UML modelling of the ebRIM information model supporting the registration of ISO 19115 
and ISO 19119 metadata sets is provided in Annex B. A description of this modelling is 
provided in Annex C. 

7.2.3 ISO information model 

The ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile of CS-W supports distributed search with OGC 
CSW 2.0.2 base profile catalogs and catalogs based on other CSW 2.0.2 profiles, as described 
in Clause 7.6 of [OGC 07-045]. 

Interoperability between an ISO 19115/19119 ebRIM Profile service and an ISO 
19115/19119 Profile service concerns:

Figure 5 - Interoperability between ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile and ISO 19115/19119 
Application Profile servers 

Both aspects require the translation of the request into the information model of the server and 
the translation of the response into the information model of the client. However, due to the 
structure of the ISO Information Model and the constraints expressed in the ISO 19115/19119 
Application Profile, the requests that can be performed by an ISO 19115/19119 Application 
Profile client are less complex in terms of scope and syntax than those performed by an ISO 
19115/19119 ebRIM Application Profile client. Therefore, interoperability can be more easily 
achieved between an ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile client and an ISO 19115/19119 
ebRIM Application Profile server than vice-versa. 

To enable interoperability between an ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile client and an ISO 
19115/19119 ebRIM Application Profile server, a service implementing the present profile 
can optionally support the ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile information model. 
Responses at the brief, summary and full levels returned by the ISO 19115/19119 ebRIM 
Application Profile server to an ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile client shall conform to 
the ISO 19139 templates described in Annex F that define the mappings between the CIM 
properties and ISO 19139 at each level.

7.3 Supported data bindings 

7.3.1 ebXML data binding 

7.3.1.1 Application schemas 

7.3.1.1.1 External application schemas 

The application schemas described in clause 6.6 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM 
(ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] are applicable. 

7.3.1.1.2 Specific extensions 

No specific extension of the external application schemas is required for the purpose of this 
specification. 

7.3.1.2 Extension Packages 

The general explanation about the management of extension packages provide in clause 6.4 of 
OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] are 
applicable. 

A Core ISO Metadata (CIM) extension package is defined as part of this specification. All 
compliant implementations must support it (see Annex B). This CIM extension package is an 
extension of the Basic extensions package defined in Annex B of the OGC Catalogue 
Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025]. Additional packages 
may be defined by other parties as needed, and particularly; 

• to extend the underlying information model defined in this document to support the 
cataloguing of ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 metadata. These extensions may aim at 
registering more ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 metadata element, user community specific 
metadata elements defined in a class 2 profile of ISO 19115 or ISO 19119, and metadata 
elements defined in standard extensions of ISO 19115 and ISO 19119, i.e., ISO 19115-2, 
Information Geographic –Metadata for Imagery  

• to provide extension of the ebRIM information model for other dedicated resources, such 
as feature catalogues and feature types as defined in ISO 19110, spatial reference systems 
as defined in ISO 19111, gazetters and geographic identifiers as defined in ISO 19112, … 

The CIM extension package, as well as the potential additional packages, employ elements of 
ebRIM and the Basic package as suggested in Figure 3.

7.3.2.1 Predefined property sets 

The statements expressed in clause 7.4 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 
15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] concerning the predefined property sets, and their 
relationship with the ebRIM information items are applicable. 

7.3.2.2 Mapping registry objects to CSW records 

This specification remains compliant with the mapping of registry objects to CSW records 
defined in clause 7.6 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of 
CS-W [OGC 05-025], but it defines a CIM information model (see clause 7.2.2 as well as 
Annexes B and C) supporting the registration of ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 metadata. 

A mapping between the ebRIM CIM information Model and the metadata elements 
composing CS-W records is defined in Annex E. 

7.4 Service information model 

This application profile adopts the service information model of the OGC Catalogue Services 
– ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025]. 

7.5 Native language support 

The statements expressed in clause 7.7 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 
15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] relatively to the support of multilingual property 
values are applicable.

OGC 07-038 

7.6 Distributed Search 

As the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025], 
this application profile does not support the ability to distribute a client request to other 
catalogues within a federation. But, an ebRIM catalogue can manage registry objects 
corresponding to resources managed in one or more item repositories. 

Consequently, this specification enables a distributed management of the metadata about 
geospatial data, geospatial services and geospatial applications in distributed metadata 
repositories, but requires a publication of repository entries into one or more catalogue 
registries. This allows the cataloguing of a wide range of resources from a wide set of 
repositories by a chosen set of catalogues, ensuring that the only the relevant repository 
resources relevant are considered by a given catalogue. 

 

8 External interfaces 

8.1 Imported protocol bindings 

8.1.1 HTTP method bindings 

This specification makes use of the HTTP method bindings in the conditions defined in clause 
7.1 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-
025]. 

This specification also adopts the requirements defined in clause 7.1 of the OGC Catalogue 
Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] relatively to the use of 
common HTTP message header fields. 

8.2 Interfaces 

8.2.1 OGCWebService interface 

This specification adopts the OGCWebService interface defined in clause 8 of the OGC 
Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025]. 

8.2.2 Discovery interface 

8.2.2.1 Applicability of the discovery interface defined in the ebRIM profile of CS-W 

This specification adopts the Discovery interface defined in clause 9 of the OGC Catalogue 
Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025], and particularly: 

• The GetRecords operation defined in its clause 9.1; 
• The GetRecordById operation defined in its clause 9.2; 
• The DescribeRecord operation defined in its clause 9.3; 
• The GetDomain operation defined in its clause 9.4; 
• The GetRepositoryItem operation defined in its clause 9.5.

OGC 07-038 

8.2.2.2 Specificity of the GetRepositoryItem operation 

The only object types defined in the CIM Extension Package that are expected to be linked to 
repository items are : *:ServiceMetadata and *:DataMetadata. 

8.2.3 Publication interface 

8.2.3.1 Applicability of the publication interface defined in the ebRIM profile of CS-W 

This specification adopts the Publication interface defined in clause 10 of the OGC Catalogue 
Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025], and particularly: 

• The optional Harvest operation defined in its clause 10.1; 
• The optional Transaction operation defined in its clause 10.2. 

8.2.3.2 Building CIM ebRIM objects from an ISO 19115/19119 metadata record 

The publication of an ISO 19115 / ISO 19119 metadata record needs to create a set of registry 
objects. The mapping between ISO 19115/ISO 19119 and the CIM Information Model 
provided in Annex F defines how to ensure the publication of the metadata records 
consistently. 

8.2.4 Error handling 

The statements expressed in clause 7 of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 
15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025] relatively to exception reports are applicable. 

8.3 Query facilities 

8.4 General implementation guidance 

8.4.1 Technical issues 

8.4.1.1 Multiplicity of slots 

The UML Models of the ebRIM  Core ISO Metadata (CIM) expresses the need to repeat the 
ebRIM slots. This is not possible accordingly to version 3.0 of ebRIM. Consequentely, the 
slots will not be repeated, but they will have instead multiple values. 

8.4.2 Semantic issues

Annex B 
(normative) 

 
The Core ISO Metadata (CIM) ebRIM Model 

B.1 Introduction 

The Core ISO Metadata (CIM) information model is expressed in UML. The UML diagrams 
follow the UML notation defined in clause 5.2. They are specifically constrained to respect 
the specific constraints of the ebXML Registry Information Model. 

The following classes stereotypes are used: 

• <<ExtrinsicObject>> corresponds to the ebRIM object types deriving directly or 
indirectly from the ebRIM extrinsic object. 

• <<RegistryObject>> corresponds to the ebRIM object types deriving directly or 
indirectly from the ebRIM registry object. 

• <<Classification Scheme>> corresponds to the definition a classification scheme. The 
attribute of a classification scheme have necessarily the <<node>> stereotype.  

The following attribute stereotypes are used: 

• <<slot>> corresponds to ebRIM slots. The name of the UML attribute is the identifier 
of the corresponding slot. 

• <<classification>> corresponds to an ebRIM classification. The name of the UML 
attribute is the name of the Classification Node or Classification Scheme defining the 
classification. When a data type is defined, it represents the context of the 
classification, i.e. the name of a classification of the classification. 

• <<node> corresponds to a classification node of a classification scheme or a parent 
classification node 

The name of an association is the name of the ebRIM association type. The associations are 
unidirectional and binary like the ebRIM association types. The UML class connected to the 
navigable side of the association corresponds to the target ebRIM object types.  

Note 1: The Core ISO Metadata (CIM) information model expresses a specific use of the 
underlying ebRIM data structure of the ISO Metadata Registry. Such registry shall satisfy the 
minimum cardinalities, but may contain information not defined in the CIM information 
model. 

Note 2: An ISO Metadata Registry focuses on the registration of the resource metadata 
including all object and association types described in clause B.2 to B.6. The resource 
metadata is a set of information providing a metadata point of view on four types of 
information resources (application, service, dataset and dataset collection) constituting the 
context of the Metadata. The object types corresponding to the information resources may be 
further described by different object types providing complementary points of view on the 
information resources. The service model, service grounding and service profile object types

OGC 07-038 

defined in the Basic Extension Package of the OGC Catalogue Services – ebRIM (ISO/TS 
15000-3) profile of CS-W [OGC 05-025], expresses three different points of view on the 
service information resource which are complementary to the service metadata defined herein. 
Points of view other than metadata may also be expressed on data information resources, e.g. 
feature catalogues, product specifications... The object and association types defined in clause 
B.7 are optional. Their implementation by a registry becomes useful when the registry 
manages different points of views on the information resources. 

B.2 Resource Metadata 

B.2.1 General Properties of the Resource Metadata 

The resource metadata object types are abstract; they can only be instantiated through the 
derived object types (i.e. ServiceMetadata and DataMetadata).

B.7 Information Resources 

B.7.1 Metadata Context 

This extension package focuses on the four types of information resources defined hereafter. 
The information resources and their associations constitute the context of the resource 
metadata. Other information resources may be described using the resource metadata 
introduced in clause B.2.

Annex C 
(normative) 

 
The Core ISO Metadata (CIM) data dictionary 

C.1 Overview 

C.1.1 Introduction 

This data dictionary describes the characteristics of the Core ISO Metadata UML model 
defined in Annex B. The dictionary is specified in a hierarchy to establish relationships and an 
organization for the information. The dictionary is categorised into sections for the 
description of the UML classes of the model.  

The slot value types and classifications are described in clauses C.3 and C.4. 

C.1.2 Notation 

Each UML model class equates to a data dictionary entity. Each UML model class attribute 
equates to a data dictionary element. The shaded rows define entities. The classes and 
attributes within the data dictionary are defined by six attributes, described below. Besides, an 
seventh column provides additional information. 

C.1.2.1 Name 

A label assigned to a class or an attribute. The associations linking a class to another class are 
handled as roles. In this case, the Name of the role is that of the target class of the association. 
Classes start with an upper case letter, with no spaces. Multiple words are concatenated, with 
each new subword starting with a capital letter (example: XnnnYmmm). Class names are 
unique within the entire data dictionary of this specification. Attribute names are unique 
within a class, not the entire data dictionary. Attribute names are made unique, within an 
application, by the combination of the class and attribute names (example: Dataset.title). 

C.1.2.2 Definition 

The class or attribute description. 

C.1.2.3 Obligation/Condition 

This is a descriptor indicating whether a class or attribute shall always be documented in the 
registry or sometimes be documented (i.e. contains value(s)). This descriptor may have the 
following values: 

• Mandatory (M): The class or attribute shall be documented. 

36 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 



OGC 07-038 

• Conditional (C): Specifies an electronically manageable condition under which at least 
one metadata entity or a metadata element is mandatory. ‘Conditional’ is used for one 
of the three following possibilities: 

o Expressing a choice between two or more options. At least one option is 
mandatory and must be documented. 

o Documenting a class or an attribute if another element has been documented. 

o Documenting an attribute if a specific value for another attribute has been 
documented. 

To facilitate reading by humans, the specific value is used in plain text. If the answer 
to the condition is positive, then the class or the attribute shall be mandatory. 

• Optional (O): The metadata entity or the metadata element may be documented or 
may not be documented. Optional classes may have mandatory elements; those 
elements only become mandatory if the optional class is used. 

C.1.2.4 Maximum occurrence 

Specifies the maximum number of instances the role or the attribute may have. Single 
occurrences are shown by “1”; repeating occurrences are represented by “N”. Fixed number 
occurrences other than one are allowed, and will be represented by the corresponding number 
(i.e. “2”, “3”…etc). 

C.1.2.5 Stereotype 

Specifies the stereotype on which the class or attribute is based. 

C.1.2.6 Data type 

Specifies a set of distinct values for representing the role or attribute; for example, Integer, 
String, InternationalString, DateTime and Boolean.

Annex D 
(normative) 

 
The Core ISO Metadata (CIM) extension package 

D.1 Introduction 

The Core ISO Metadata (CIM) extension package introduces artefacts for the cataloguing 
of geospatial dataset, dataset collections and services metadata conforming basically to 
ISO 19115 and ISO 19119. All conforming implementations must deploy this package, 
the members of which are summarized in the following subclauses. The assigned package 
identifier complies with the ‘ogc’ URN scheme: “urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebRIM-
cim:package:CIM”. 

The CIM extension package extends the Basic extension package defined in Annex B of 
the ebRIM profile of CS-W [05-025]. It requires the same canonical ebRIM classification 
schemes as those detailed in B.1 of [05-025]. 

D.2 CIM extrinsic objects 

The CIM extension package adds the extrinsic object types listed in Table D.1. Each 
object type is assigned an identifier based on the ‘ogc’ URN scheme; the asterisk in the 
type identifier denotes the following string, which has been omitted for convenience in 
the table: 

urn:x-ogc:specification:csw-ebrim-cim:ObjectType  

Table D.1 — New extrinsic object types included in the CIM 

Object type ID Description 
*:Application Information resource that is accessible over the Internet and does not fit 

into the category of services (See the Service extrinsic Object defined as 
part of the Basic Extension Package of the ebRIM profile of CS-W [05-

Annex E 
(normative) 

 
Mapping between the Core ISO Metadata (CIM) information model 

and the metadata elements of CS-W records 

E.1 Introduction 

This annex describes the mappings to the CIM model of: 

• The OGC Core Queryable and Returnable properties, defined in the Catalogue 
Service specification. A mapping of these properties to ISO 19115 and ISO 19119 
is specified in the ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile of CS-W [OGC 07-045]. 

• The additional queryable properties defined in [OGC 07-045] where they are 
mapped to the ISO 19115/19119 model. 

• The additional summary returnable elements defined in [OGC 07-045] 
 

These queryables are detailed in tables, which define: 

• The name of the queryable or returnable property 
• Its definition 
• Its data type (except for returnables) 
• Its mapping to the CIM model. This mapping is expressed as a path in the UML 

model with further constraints when necessary. 

E.2 Mapping of the OGC Core Queryables and Returnables 

E.2.1 OGC Core Queryables 

NOTE: “Title”, “AnyText” and “Identifier” are mandatory queryables. Core queryable 
properties that cannot have a value assigned (e.g. the information is not available in the 
information model of the catalogue instance) shall be considered as having a value of 
NULL.

E.2 Mapping of the ISO Profile Queryables and Returnables 

E.2.1 Mapping of the ISO Profile Queryables 

The ISO 19115/19119 Application Profile of CS-W defines additional queryable 
properties which shall be supported by implementations of this application profile. 

The catalogue should deliver all supported queryable properties in its Capabilities 
document. The following should be noted: If a catalogue entry holds a null-value for 
queryable X, this entry does not fulfil any query constraint on that queryable except “is 
Null”. 

If search properties are applied on an information resource which does not support this 
search property, the catalogue throws an exception. However, there are also additional 
search properties which are common to all information resources.

Annex F 
(normative) 

 
Mapping between the Core ISO Metadata (CIM) information model 

and ISO 19115 / ISO 19119  

F.1 Introduction 

This Annex describes the mapping between the Core ISO Metadata (CIM) information 
model and ISO 19115 / ISO 19119. The principle is to define how to set up a consistent 
set of ebRIM registry objects from a given ISO 19115/IOS 19119 metadata record. The 
mapping between CIM and ISO 19115/ISO19119 is presented through 3 column tables: 

- the first column defines the ISO 19115/ISO19119 class properties; 
- the second column defines the CIM implementation of each property 
- the last column provides complementary explanations when needed. 

F.2 Registration of a metadata record 

A metadata record is an instance of the class MD_Metadata or one of its subclasses. Each 
metadata record will require: 

- the creation of a Registry Object based on the MetadataInformation Extrinsic 
Object to handle the information related to the metadata record itself: file 
identifier, language used and date of creation, as defined in Table ; 

- the creation of a Registry Object based on the DataMetadata or ServiceMetadata 
Extrinsic Objects for each instance of MD_Metadata.identificationInfo to handle 
among other things some of the properties of MD_Metadata: hierarchy level 
information and possibly links to the metadata record and parent metadata record 
information stored in two instances of the MetadataInformation Extrinsic Object. 
Table  defines the mapping of this information to DataMetadata and/or 
ServiceMetadata. The mapping of the actual content of 
MD_Metadata.identificationInfo to DataMetadata and ServiceMetadata is defined 
in clause F.3. 

- when the parentIdentifier attribute is instantiated, a second instance of 
MetadataInformation will be created, along with an instance of the 
ParentMetadataInformation association between ResourceMetadata and 
MetadataInformation. 

 

Table F.1 depicts the mapping of MD_Metadata properties to the Extrinsic Object 
MetadataInformation.

Some properties of MD_Metadata are mapped to the Extrinsic Object ResourceMetadata. 
An instance of DataMetadata or ServiceMetadata is created for each instance of 
MD_Metadata.identificationInfo. This implies to duplicate some pieces of information of 
MD_Metadata in each of the instance of DataMetadata and ServiceMetadata pertaining to 
a unique metadata record. This mapping is defined in Table F.2.

F.3 Registration of the information resources 

F.3.1 Preamble 

Each instance of MD_Metadata.identificationInfo describes an information resource 
concerned by the metadata record. In this profile, the cardinality of this property is 
restricted to 1..1 for the ISO 19139 metadata files stored in the ebRIM Repository. The 
restriction on this cardinality makes it easier to manage the associations between the 
registry objects and repository items. Besides, it is compliant with the ISO 19115/19119 
Application Profile of CS-W and does not prevent metadata producers to store internally 
metadata files with multiple MD_Metadata.identificationInfo properties in a single 
MD_Metadata element.

The information resource will be: 

- a Dataset or Dataset Collection if MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel is set to ‘dataset’. 
In this case, the metadata record will contain one property 
Metadata.identificationInfo of type MD_DataIdentification or one of its subtypes; 

- a Service if MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel is set to ‘service’. In this case, the 
metadata record will contain one property Metadata.identificationInfo of type 
SV_ServiceIdentification or one of its subtypes;  

- an Application if MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel is set to ‘application’. In this 
case, the metadata record will contain one property Metadata.identificationInfo of 
type MD_DataIdentificarion or SV_ServiceIdentification or one of their subtypes; 

 

There are many possible ways to defined whether the information resource if a dataset or 
a dataset collection: 

- if the value of MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel is series, then it is a dataset 
collection; 

- in the case of an ISO 19139 compliant metadata record, the value of the 
MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel property may serve as a discriminator since ISO 
19139 extends the MD_ScopeCode codelist to add specific values for 
aggregation; 

- the instance of MD_DataIdentification may aggregate instances of 
MD_AggregateInformation defining whether the resource is an aggregate or a 
dataset; 

- the instance of MD_Metadata may be associated with or aggregated to an instance 
of DS_Dataset, DS_Aggregate or one of their subclasses allowing the 
discrimination. 

- MD_Metadata.parentIdentifier may be used to access the information resources 
aggregating the information resources of the current metadata record. 

Whatever the context is, it is then possible to instantiate also the Subset association type 
between the generated instances of Dataset and Dataset Collection. 

An application resource can only be identified through the value of 
MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel (set to ‘application’). It is then possible to instantiate the 
IsClientOf and OperatesOn association types between Application and Service and 
Application and Dataset. 

A service resource is identified through the value of MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel (set to 
‘service’) and the existence of at least one instance of Metadata.identificationInfo of type 
SV_ServiceIdentification. It is then possible to instantiate the OperatesOn association 
type between Service and Dataset. 

Dataset, DatasetCollection, Application and Service along with the associations that 
connect them are part of the Metadata Context of the CIM. Instantiating these classes is 
optional. A valid catalogue service can only implement the classes defined in the

F.3.2 Registration of a Dataset, a Dataset Collection or an Application 

A information resource of type dataset or dataset collection, identified as such as 
described in F.3.1 implies to create an instance of the Dataset Extrinsic Object or the 
DatasetCollection Extrinsic Object. An instance of MD_Metadata.identificationInfo of 
type MD_DataIdentification in the metadata record implies to create an instance of 
DataMetadata based on the properties of the instance of MD_DataIdentification.  

A value of ‘application’ for the MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel attribute implies to create 
an instance of the Application Extrinsic Object. An instance of 
MD_Metadata.identificationInfo of type MD_DataIdentification in the metadata record 
implies to create an instance of DataMetadata based on the properties of the instance of 
MD_DataIdentification.  

Application, Dataset and DatasetCollection instances are part of the metadata context and 
do not have any attributes. An MD_Metadata.identificationInfo instance of type 
MD_DataIdentification is mapped to an instance of the DataMetadata Extrinsic Object, as 
defined in Table F.3.

F.3.3 Registration of a service or an application 

A value of ‘service’ for the MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel attribute implies to create an 
instance of the Service Registry Object. An instance of MD_Metadata.identificationInfo 
of type SV_ServiceIdentification in the metadata record implies to create an instance of 
ServiceMetadata based on the properties of the instance of SV_ServiceIdentification.  

A value of ‘application’ for the MD_Metadata.hierarchyLevel attribute implies to create 
an instance of the Application Extrinsic Object. An instance of 
MD_Metadata.identificationInfo of type SV_ServiceIdentification in the metadata record 
implies to create an instance of ServiceMetadata based on the properties of the instance 
of SV_ServiceIdentification.  

Service and Application instances are part of the metadata context and do not have any 
attributes. MD_Metadata.identificationInfo of type SV_ServiceIdentification is mapped 
to the Extrinsic Object ServiceResourceMetadata, as defined in Table F.5.
