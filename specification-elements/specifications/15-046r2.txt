Abstract 

This OGC Engineering Report describes the high-resolution flood information scenario 
carried out under the Urban Climate Resilience Thread of the Testbed 11 Initiative. The 
scenario was developed for two areas of interest: the San Francisco Bay Area and in 
Mozambique. The scenarios for these two locations demonstrate the interoperation and 
capabilities of open geospatial standards in supporting data and processing services. The 
prototype High Resolution Flood Information System addresses access and control of 
simulation models and high-resolution data in an open, worldwide, collaborative Web 
environment. The scenarios were designed to help testbed participants examine the 
feasibility and capability of using existing OGC geospatial Web Service standards in 
supporting the on-demand, dynamic serving of flood information from models with 
forecasting capacity. Change requests to OGC standards have also been identified 
through the Testbed activity.

3 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this report, the definitions specified in Clause 4 of the OWS Common 
Implementation Standard [OGC 06-121r3] and in OGC® Abstract Specification Topic on 
disasters shall apply. In addition, the following terms and definitions apply. 

3.1 Flood 
flood 
A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land which is usually dry. The flooding 
event causes interruption of telecommunication and infrastructure damage when and 
where geospatial technologies are called for in emergency response. 

3.2 Synchronization 
synchronization 
 
In geospatial computation, synchronization refers to one of two distinct but related 
concepts: synchronization of processes, and synchronization of data. In the context, the 
latter is the focus. Data Synchronization refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a 
dataset in coherence with one another, or to maintain data integrity.

Figure 1 — Overall architecture on the flood scenario  

The specified high resolution flood information scenario addresses access to and control 
of simulation models and high-resolution data. In the scenario, clients can access and 
control the models through suites of OGC standards, including Sensor Observation 
Service (SOS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature 
Service (WFS), Web Processing Service (WPS), and Web Coverage Processing Service 
(WCPS), as shown in Figure 2.

6.1 Study areas 

6.1.1 San Francisco Bay 

6.1.1.1 Description 

The San Francisco bay study area is shown in Figure 3. In the study area, high resolution 
digital elevation model (DEM) is derived from LiDAR data. Bathymetry is measured by 
single- and multi-beam SONAR (SOund Navigation And Ranging). These DEM and 
bathymetry data are fed into the flood simulation model to calculate and simulate a flood. 
The results are provided in three formats: netCDF (nc), asc and geotiff.

Figure 3. San Francisco Bay study area 

 
The nc file shows 31 dummy timesteps, so 31 variables essentially 
("timestep_1","timestep_2","timestep_3",...). Data always show flood depth in meters. 
The final global 2-D flood models can be downscaled at 30 m. 
  
 

6.1.1.2 Data 

The data for the San Francisco study area are as follows:

in the San Francisco Bay Region (http://cascade.wr.usgs.gov/data/Task2b-
SFBay/data.shtm)  

o GeoTIFF masks of areas at risk of inundation  

o sea level rise: 0/50/100/140/150cm  

o recurrence interval or tidal datum: daily, monthly, 1/10/50/100/500 year  

 Dynamic flood model outputs (dummy examples) 
(https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=61987) 

o Water depth under a sea level rise scenario of 100 cm  

o "To "fake" different flood depth outputs at different times, we flooded the 
Lidar DEM (re-sampled at 5 m due to size of files) using incremental 
advances of water to different land elevation thresholds". Perhaps this can 
be done on the fly with a Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) 
service instance. 

o Timeseries (31 time-steps in days)  

 Dynamic flood model outputs (real event and sea level rise, .asc/.geotiff formats) 

o A 2-D high-resolution urban flood model[2][3] simulated flooding of San 
Francisco Bay and San Francisco Airport (SFO) area at a 5 meter 
resolution for a historic (1996) event and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario. 
The model was developed and provided by Remote Sensing Solutions Inc 
and SSBN Ltd. The model was conditioned using a high-resolution 
estuary model to simulate the tides and surge. 

 DEM. 

6.1.1.3 Flood modeling processes 

The flood modeling processes for San Francisco Bay area consist of both land and coastal 
hydrological processes. Figure 4 illustrates the flood modeling processes involved in the 
San Francisco area. Three models, i.e. Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) [4], 
Semi-implicit Eulerian-Lagrangian Finite Element (SELFE) [5], and LISFLOOD-FP 
[2][3], are used to model oceans, estuaries, and floodplains respectively. ROMS [4] is a 
split-explicit, free-surface, topography-following-coordinate oceanic model. It was used 
to model the ocean processes close to the San Francisco Bay. SELFE [5] system is 
designed for simulating 3D baroclinic circulation across river-to-ocean scales. It was used 
to model river-to-ocean circulation in the San Francisco Bay area. LISFLOOD-FP 
[2][3][6][7] is a two-dimensional,  hydrodynamic, GIS-based hydrological rainfall-
runoff-routing model specifically designed to simulate floodplain inundation in a 



OGC 15-046r22

computationally efficient manner over complex topography. It was used to model 
flooding in the San Francisco Bay area. Three models worked together to model oceans, 
estuaries, and floodplains systematically.

6.1.2 Mozambique 

6.1.2.1 Description 

The Mozambique study area is shown in Figure 5. In the study area, digital elevation 
model (DEM) data are mainly SRTM-DEM at 1 km, 90 m, and 30 m. These DEM and 
bathymetry data are fed into the flood simulation model to calculate and simulate a flood.

6.1.2.2 Data 

The data for the Mozambique study area are as follows: 

 A “global-scale” version of the 2-D LISFLOOD-FP flood model[2][3][6][7]  
simulated a flooding at different return intervals and water depth from the model 
was downscaled onto the 90 meter SRTM-DEM. The model and its product were 
developed and provided by Remote Sensing Solutions Inc and SSBN Ltd.

6.4 Data processing components 

6.4.1 Geosyncrhonization service 

The Envitia GeoPackage supports OGC WPS 1.0.0 (OGC 05-007r7). It has two 
processes: GeoPackaging and GeoSynchronize. The WPS service endpoint is at 
http://86.188.147.108:8080/MapLinkOGCServices/GPKG?  

6.4.2 Flood simulation model 

The 52North WPS supports OGC WPS 2.0.0 (OGC 14-065). There are two processes 
implemented: Flood Feature Enrichment (testbed11.FloodEnrichmentProcess) and Flood 
Impact Assessment (testbed11.FloodImpactAssessment). The Flood Feature Enrichment 
Process allows users to send their vector features to this service in order to enrich them 
with flood results from WCPS raster services or NetCDF raster datasets and wraps an 
FME Server instance (See next paragraph for more details about the process and the 
enclosed services). The Flood Impact Assessment process wraps GCAM model 
(http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/models/gcam/). The process takes a percentage of 
non-arable (i.e. flooded) land as input, as well as the desired output parameter of the 
model (e.g. commodity prices). Internally, the given percentage of land is set to 
unavailable and the model is run.  The impact on the requested parameter of the model 
due to the flooding can be assessed by comparing two diagrams of the parameter with 
and without unavailable land. 

Safe Software implemented a Feature Enrichment REST Service on top of the GeoTIFF 
and NetCDF results coming from the high resolution flood model. The purpose of this 
service was to support the 52N WPS for vector feature enrichment. This service accepts 
GML features in the form of HTTP POST request, extracts the appropriate flood 
information from the flood model raster output (NetCDF, WCPS or GeoTIFF) and then 
enriches the GML with the appropriate flood level data for that feature’s geographic 
location and transmits the result back to the client. A transformation model was created 
which extracts flood level information from the relevant raster flood results and inserts it 
into the query feature’s GML. This transformation model was created using an FME 



OGC 15-046r22

workspace and then published it to FMEcloud as a REST data streaming service. This 
REST service was then wrapped by a WPS from 52N. Appendix A has some sample 
WPS requests and responses which shows how the GML was updated. FME provides a 
wide range of data translation, transformation and integration tools and supports close to 
400 formats including relevant OGC standards (GML, web services) and many 
proprietary formats and services. 

6.4.3 On-demand flood information processing

6.5 High resolution flood information system 

The overall interactions among the loosely coupled components are enabled and 
facilitated by Standards developed by the OGC. The component interactions are captured 
in the subsequent use cases that demonstrate the use of the overall systems. This ER 
covers the overall interactions and has a focus on inundation simulation data access and 
model control. Details of analysis, transaction, and GeoPackage scenarios are covered in 
other Engineering Reports. 

The interactions among the components are best viewed in the context of the flood 
scenario. The overall goal is to provide instant access and control to information for 
better event response and preparation. The scenario can be broken down into seven use 
cases. Each use case demonstrates different technical aspects. The use cases are: 

(1) Use case 1: Dynamic parameterization of simulation models 

(2) Use case 2: Image transactions using WFS-T 



OGC 15-046r22 

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 17 
 

(3) Use case 3: Schema mapping 

(4) Use case 4: GeoPackage and geodata synchronization 

(5) Use case 5: Evacuation route production with GeoPackages 

(6) Use case 6: Streaming of high resolution imagery data 

(7) Use case 7: Preparing and planning for the future 

6.5.1  Use case 1: Dynamic parameterization of simulation models 

When a flood is predicted, in order to understand potential consequences for a local area 
under different possible scenarios, flood response operators need to run a number of 
simulation models. By providing a façade to simulation models using Web services, 
operators can interact with simulation models and dynamically parameterize them 
without understanding the full complexity of the models. Behind the service interfaces, 
simulation models can dynamically load data from other web services. In our case, one 
simulation model uses output from another simulation model as well as other data sets 
such as high resolution LIDAR data; all opaque to the user. The second model allows 
adding a value for sea level rise to the simulation model to understand how threats will 
develop in future.

Figure 8. Sequence chart for dynamic parameterization of simulation model 

 

Figure 8 shows the interaction sequence for dynamic parameterization of simulation 
models. In this use case, two flood models are implemented as Web Processing Service 
process. They are decoupled but they can work together seamlessly and effortlessly on 
the fly due to the open standards. A user could easily change the model boundary file and 
adds sea level rise. The changes can be submitted through a request to the server where 
the model would be rerun and results returned to the user. The user can interact with 
WCPS to make selection and to control the models. 

 
6.5.2 Use case 2: Image transactions using WFS-T 

In the event of predicted flood, preparations have to take place. One example is the 
treatment of manholes. Engineers need to inspect and treat manhole to prevent flood 



OGC 15-046r22 

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 19 
 

water from entering the waste water system through vented manholes. Previously, Web 
Feature Services supported the transactional handling of images insufficiently. Testbed-
11 enabled WFS to deal with images in a transactional way. More technical details of the 
use case will be covered in a separate engineering report on transactions. 

6.5.3 Use case 3: Schema mapping 

Data about physical items may be stored in more than one database. In the flood scenario, 
manhole data are stored in two enterprise systems at the city level. Both databases 
contain the same data to a large extent, but differ in some feature characteristics. 
Dynamic schema mapping techniques are called for to facilitate the integration of data 
from two different systems. More technical details will be covered in a specific 
engineering report on geographic feature transaction services involving WFS-T.  

6.5.4 Use case 4: GeoPackage and geodata synchronization 

In the emergency of flooding, internet connectivity may be an issue. It is important that 
even complex data can be used in offline mode. When connection is back, the 
synchronization of geospatial database is necessary for purpose of updating from/to 
server. In the example of manhole inspection, field workers may download the data as a 
GeoPackage before going out into the field. Once in the field they work on those local 
copies. If two field workers meet in the field, data can be synchronized between the two 
by setting up a direct device-to-device connection. Once back home, field workers can 
synchronize their local copies with the enterprise system.  The GeoPackage 
synchronization is achieved through using WFS and WPS. More technical details will be 
reported in the Engineering Report on GeoPackage synchronization (15-062r2). 

6.5.5 Use case 5: Evacuation route production with GeoPackages 

Routing alternatives are necessary when flooding prevent access to the main evacuation 
routes. This becomes even more problematic when there is an issue with internet 
connections and hence offline solution is needed. The underlying technology to deal with 
this issue is to use GeoPackages to store evacuation route alternatives for offline use. The 
generation and updating of GeoPackages is facilitated through WPS interfaces. More 
technical details will be covered in the Engineering Report on GeoPackage supporting 
routes (15-067). 

6.5.6 Use case 6: Streaming of high resolution imagery data 

Geo-referenced annotated high resolution imagery is needed at different detail levels in 
an emergency. Annotation may need to be done in the field with mobile devices such as 
smart phones. To support the efficient delivery and representation of the geo-referenced 
imagery, the Testbed used GMLJP2 to annotate imagery in JPEG2000 while JPIP 
streaming was used. The imagery was uploaded from the device to the WCS server (via 
WCS-T) and to a WFS server, and thus made available to users and services for 
processing and cross queries over the AOI. The user can connect to the server and 
retrieve information from the WCS and/or JPIP server to verify his/her surroundings to 



OGC 15-046r22

check for risks in the area with the download of annotated imagery. More technical 
details and change request will be reported in an Engineering Report on GMLJP2 Testing 
Results. 

6.5.7 Use case 7: Preparing and planning for the future 

Forecasting models may be implemented with different data models. Integration of 
results from different models can be challenging. For the flooding scenario, questions 
may rise for long-term planning, e.g. 20 year planning. What would happen in 20 years if 
global warming continues? What effect does this have to coastal populations? To answer 
these questions, we would combine results from flood simulation/forecasting model and 
GCAM. The OGC suite of standards, specifically WCPS and WPS along with geospatial 
encoding standards, are used to achieve the on-the-fly, customized, interoperable 
accessing, processing, integrating, and presenting geospatial data. 

 

Figure 9. Sequence chart for future planning 



OGC 15-046r22

Figure 9 shows a possible workflow to produce, integrate, and present information from 
different models, detailed as follows. 

1)     Client requests national-scale flooding calculation for 1:10, 1:100, or 1:1000 years 
return period 

2)     WPS starts model and produces 1km resolution data 

3)     Client provides from WCPS the percentage of arable land for Mozambique (area of 
interest) 

4)     WCPS starts downscaling and calculates classification of raster to ‘0’ outside AoI 
and depth to ‘1’ inside area and requests calculation of total area flooded as a percentage 
in the entire country area 

5)     WCPS returns single figure with percentage of arable land 

6)     Client requests impact assessment by running GCAM model behind WPS; client 
provides %of arable land and desired parameter for impact assessment. 

7)     WPS returns impact assessment as diagrams (images). The result of a model run 
with no flooded areas will be returned alongside the requested result for comparison. 
Diagrams can be visualized in the client. 

7 Conclusions and remarks 

7.1 Lessons learned 

7.1.1 On-the-fly access and control models with WCPS 

The flood emergency response needs to evaluate different alternative decisions and their 
outcome. This requires full understanding of consequences under specific conditions. 
Flood simulation models have to be experimented with different initial parameters. In this 
testbed, the flood modeling WPS can be set and run with user’s inputs on parameters. A 
user can now parameterize complex simulation models efficiently. 

7.1.2 Syncrhonization of geofeatures 

The geospatial databases for decision support and disaster relief need to be updated and 
maintained to reflect the current situation after flooding events. The update requirements 
can be done by either assigned field workers or volunteers. Several needs have been 
identified in this testbed: 

(1) New content, imagery attribute to a geographic feature, needs to be 
inserted/updated/deleted remotely for efficiency and timeliness. 



OGC 15-046r22 

22 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

(2) Geospatial databases need to stay in synchronization automatically to provide 
decision makers updated information for better decision in flooding emergency 
situation. Different schema may be involved. The schema mapping needs to be 
done while the updating can be properly done. 

(3) Internet connections or wireless connections may be an issue during flooding 
disasters due to infrastructure damage. Inspections and update need to be better 
supported with proper data management. Information needs to stay synchronized 
as fast as the available internet/wireless connection allows if updating is required. 

The solutions to these issues are respectively proposed and tested as follows. 

(1) Change request to the transaction service of WFS to support management of 
imagery features as attributes to geographic feature. 

(2) Semantic matching and mapping of different schemas needs to be developed and 
adopted to support fast and robust updating of geospatial databases.  

(3) GeoPackage is used to efficiently manage complex geospatial databases that 
allow information to be better managed when offline. Synchronization of 
GeoPackages is developed and tested. The method for synchronization at the 
GeoPackage level is found to be an efficient mechanism to support complex 
information maintenance. 

7.1.3 Offline geodata support with geopackage 

The intermittent availability of internet/wireless telecommunication can happen during 
flooding disasters. Maintaining continuous access to information is required while 
geospatial functions, such as alternative routing and geolocation, should not be 
interrupted. These geospatial functions require large and complex data support. This 
Testbed found that the OGC GeoPackage is a solution to efficiently manage complex 
geospatial information and databases offline while geospatial capabilities are not 
suffered. GeoPackage facilitates the management of complex geospatial data to meet the 
informational and functional needs arisen in offline situation.  

7.1.4 High resolution imagey annotation and streaming 

Proper annotation and georeferencing of imagery is necessary in flooding emergency 
response. New imagery may be obtained and need to be updated with information from 
different sources as soon as the information becomes available. The solutions to solve 
this issue are to leverage standards such as OGC GMLJP2 that allows annotation of 
imagery information efficient while JPIP is supported to achieve fast and efficient 
delivery of complex and large imagery.

7.1.5 Multiple model integration for future planning 

One forecasting model may not be sufficient to provide enough information for future 
planning. Different and complex models may be invoked and triggered as quickly as 
information become available. Multiple runs may be required to test different 
assumptions. Outputs from different models and different runs of models may be 
different. The testbed proposed and tested a solution to efficiently run multiple models 
and integrate results with the combination of WPS, WCPS, and semantic 
synchronization. The solution works to some content while the problem still needs further 
research to support complex modeling. 

It has been evident that flood scenario modeling is crucial to natural hazard planning 
since flooding poses one of the leading risks to life and property from any natural hazard 
[8]. Add to this the impact of climate change and the problem of flooding is only 
exacerbated [9]. For this reason it is becoming increasingly important to not only model 
flooding at a local scale, but to also integrate local flood models with global climate 
change and impact models. This way, combined affects can be evaluated as storm events 
occur on top of progressive sea level rise, thereby increasing the risks and impacts over 
time.  

Nevertheless this integration poses significant challenges. One problem that becomes 
immediately apparent is the question of scale. Models like GCAM are by definition 
global in nature, at resolutions of half a degree or lower, and time steps in the order of 
months or years [10][11]. Local flood models can generate output at meter or sub-meter 
resolution with output time steps in the order of hours or minutes. 

The challenge is how to meaningfully integrate across these widely differing frames of 
reference. To address this, approaches called downscaling and upscaling are often used. 
Downscaling refers to applying global model results to local scales, in order to estimate 
what impact the global model results have in the local context [12]. This can be done 
using statistical downscaling, or dynamic downscaling [13]. An example might be the 
effect of increased max precipitation on a specific river valley, or the effect of sea level 
rise in San Francisco Bay as in this test bed case. Then there is upscaling, where local 
model results are scaled up or aggregated to a global scale. This can be useful when local 
model results are extrapolated to drive a global model. An example of upscaling might 
help answer what would be the global effect of a land use policy change over a large area 
(increased residential set back / buffers around rivers and coastlines). 

Since the discussion of integration between local and global models began relatively late 
in Testbed 11, there was insufficient time and resources to adequately address these 
issues. Given the importance of multi-model integration, it is suggested that future test 
beds consider options for how best to address this. A variety of approaches for 
downscaling and upscaling should be reviewed to see what approaches might be suitable 
for this context. Also, standards for exchanging information from one model to another 
should be explored. NetCDF and WCS were used in the context of this test bed, but 
recommended approaches and best practices for integrating across multiple models need 
to be articulated further. This would support the ability for the results of a given model to 



OGC 15-046r22 

24 Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

be aggregated with related models on both local and global scales so that cumulative 
impacts can be evaluated and the aggregate impacts of policy choices can be more fully 
explored than before. Ultimately, better OGC support for multiple model integration 
would open the door to building loosely coupled systems of models to evaluate the many 
complexities of climate change impacts that could go well beyond the abilities of what 
any one model was designed to address. 

7.1.6 Domain knowledge and use of model output 

It is recognized that domain knowledge is required to effectively convey and utilize 
information. This is in alignment with the issues and discussions raised within the OGC 
Emergency and Disaster Management Domain Working Group (EDM DWG). Lack of 
domain knowledge might cause misuse of data. Large multidimensional data sets usually 
require specific domain knowledge beyond simple metadata. The metadata may describe 
model output, issues and biases using domain knowledge. View services (e.g. WMS, 
WMTS) should have layers generated/overseen by suitable experts to ensure that they 
best represent the issues under study. Additionally, view services are best used by 
“impacts experts” to ensure correct interpretation of risks and impacts and hence ensure 
appropriate decision making. Many of these discussing points and best practice 
suggestions summarized within the EDM DWG have important value in guiding the 
practices to avoid issues of misusing data due to lack of domain knowledge. Future 
scenario development should more explicitly consider different user requirements. 

Related resources and references can be found through several registries. These needs to 
be further identified and studied in future testbed. Related activities and organizations 
should be consulted for collaboration and sharing of resources. Flood forecasting 
organizations (e.g. UK Flood Forecasting Centre) may be consulted for domain 
knowledge and data to refine the demonstration scenario. International flooding 
frameworks and legislation may be consulted for guidance. For example, the INSPIRE 
Natural Risk Zones Data Specification 
(http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Data_Specifications/INSPIRE_DataSpecification_
NZ_v3.0.pdf), EU Floods Directive (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/flood_risk/ 
and http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/interactive/floods-directive-viewer) may be 
useful in guiding the flood scenario development.
