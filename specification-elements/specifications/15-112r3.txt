1. Terms and Definitions 

The following are key terms and definitions used in the CDB standard. 

 

 Description 

A  

Aliasing Spatial and/or temporal image defects or artifacts in a raster image.  
They are due to interaction between the discrete sampling of the raster 
format and the spatial and temporal frequencies inherent in the 
computed image of edges, surfaces and point features.  Manifestation 
of spatial aliasing includes edge stair-stepping and crawling, 
scintillation of narrow surfaces, break-up of long, narrow surfaces and 
positional or angular motion of scene edges in discrete steps.  
Temporal aliasing includes double image and loss of dynamic image 
integrity due to the human eye’s ability to dynamically track 
individual fields at certain angular rates of motion. 

Ambient Illumination See Illumination, Ambient. 

Anti-aliasing Active image processing techniques that reduce the perception of the 
aliasing phenomena. 

AO1 Angle of Orientation with greater than 1 degree resolution. The 
angular distance measured from true north (0 deg) clockwise to the 
major (Y) axis of the feature. 

Areal Feature See Feature, Areal and Polygon 

Articulated Part A child part of a model (usually a moving model) that is allowed 
some degree of motion with respect to the parent body of the model.  
Examples of articulated parts include tank turrets, refueling drogues, 
and helicopter rotor blades. 

Arithmetic Logic Unit  An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform 
arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building 
block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern 
CPUs contain very powerful and complex  

B  

Background Area See Area, Background.

Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Base Material See Material, Base. 

Base Material Table 
(BMT) 

A data structure that contains a description of the Base Materials 
available to the CDB.  There is only one BMT per CDB.  Each entry 
in the BMT corresponds to a Base Material; the entry associates a 
name to the Base Material. 

C  

CDB device A device that can directly input synthetic environment data that 
conforms to the format, structure and conventions of this standard.  A 
device need not input and process all of the CDB datasets and 
attributes to be CDB-compliant.  

CDB simulator A simulator whose client-devices can input synthetic environment 
data that conforms to the format, structure and conventions of the 
CDB standard.  Any subsystem or client-device that does not natively 
conform to this standard requires that CDB data be formatted and 
structured to the device’s native format and structure through the use 
of a runtime publisher. A simulator need not input and process all of 
the CDB datasets and attributes to be CDB-compliant. 

CDB Translator An off-line software process that translates an environmental database 
from its toolset-native format(s) into one of the CDB specified 
formats. 
NOTE: The CDB data formats are based on industry standard tool 
formats; as a result a translation to the formats prescribed by this 
standard may not be required. 

CDB Server Gateway platform to CDB mass storage and applicable infrastructure.  
CDB compliant servers access, filter and distribute CDB data in 
response to requests from the Database Generation Facility (DBGF) 
and the client-devices (or their runtime publishers). 

CDB Geocell (tile) Region of the earth, aligned to lines of latitude and longitude in 
accordance with Section 2.1 CDB Core (Volume 1). The size of a 
CDB Geocell per Zone is also specified in the Core CDB Standard 
section 2.1. Also known as DGGS Cell. 

Channel A field of view segment within a visual system’s total viewing field 
for which a corresponding unique scene segment is calculated and 
presented. 

Client application A software application that requires a complete or partial synthetic 
representation of the world.  CDB applications may require a CDB 
runtime publisher to convert the CDB compliant database into a form 



 

8 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

it can directly input.  Used interchangeably with “Client-device” in 
this standard. 

Client-device Simulation subsystems (Image Generators (IGs), Radar, Weather 
Server, Computer Generated Forces (CGF) Terrain Server, etc.) that 
require a complete or partial synthetic representation of the world.  A 
CDB client-device may require a CDB runtime publisher to convert 
the CDB data into a form it can ingest. 

Coordinate One of a sequence of n-numbers designating the position of a point 
(see point) in n-dimensional space. 
NOTE In a coordinate reference system, the numbers shall be 
qualified by units. [adapted from ISO 19111] 

Coordinate  
Conversion 

coordinate operation in which both coordinate reference systems are 
based on the same datum 
 

Coordinate Reference 
System 

Coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum 
NOTE For geodetic and vertical datums, the object will be the Earth. 
[ISO 19111:2007] 

Coordinate System Set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be 
assigned to points (ISO 19111).  

Composite Material See Material, Composite. 

Composite Material 
Table 

A data structure that contains a description of the Composite 
Materials available in a CDB tile or on a model.  Each entry in the 
CMT corresponds to a Composite Material. 

Coordinate System, 
Geographic 

A geographic coordinate system (GCS) uses a three-dimensional 
spherical surface to define locations on the earth. A GCS is often 
incorrectly called a datum, but a datum is only one part of a GCS. A 
GCS includes an angular unit of measure, a prime meridian, and a 
datum (based on a spheroid).A common choice of coordinates is 
latitude, longitude and elevation (or altitude).   For the CDB, the 
reference data is based on the WGS-84 ellipsoid, i.e., geographical 
latitude j and longitude l are the angles of the normal on the WGS-84 
reference ellipsoid along the point to the equator and zero meridian.  
The angles are given as degrees, minutes and seconds.  Altitude is the 
distance above and normal to the ellipsoid in meters.  The WGS-84 
ellipsoidal earth models provides for accurate calculations over long 
distances on the earth’s surface.

Correlation, 
Algorithmic 

The degree of informational consistency between the outputs of two 
or more devices with equivalent Arithmetic Logic Units, each 
submitted to the same input data.  (e.g., consider two devices meshing 
terrain from a regular grid of elevation points, one using a regular 
mesh of right-handed triangles using the elevation points as vertices, 
and the other with a DeLauney triangulated mesh derived from the 
grid of elevation points). 

Correlation, Numerical The degree of informational consistency between the outputs of two 
or more devices, each submitted to the same input data, (e.g., two 
devices computing the sine of an angle, one with a series of 10 terms, 
and another with an interpolation of a look-up table with 100 entries, 
or one device using 32-bit signed integers for its internal 
computations and the other using single-precision floats).  The CDB 
Standard addresses Runtime Source Database numerical accuracy 
correlation errors because a single representation is used for each data 
set. 

Correlation, 
Parametric 

The degree of informational consistency between the outputs of two 
or more devices, each submitted to the same input data but to different 
control parameters (e.g., consider two devices generating regular 
meshes of right-handed triangles based on a regular grids of elevation 
points organized by Level-of-Detail (LOD), one using an LOD 
meshing tolerance parameter of 1m and the other 2m). 

Correlation, Raw 
Source DB 

The degree of informational consistency between two or more sets of 
raw data1 (i.e., inputs to a modeling station) representing aspects of 
the same environment (for instance, the correlation errors arising from 
Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) elevation data that does not 
perfectly match the satellite raster imagery due to oblique view 
distortions induced by the satellite).  Correlation errors are intrinsic to 
the process of gathering data because there is no means to gather all 
of the required data from a single device, at a single instant in time.  
Instead, datasets (e.g., elevation, raster imagery, geometry) are each 
gathered from various devices of various types, at different times, etc.  
As a result, this process inherently introduces (raw source) correlation 
errors. 

Correlation, Runtime 
DB 

The degree of informational consistency between two or more 
runtime databases representing the same synthetic environment.  The 
CDB standard eliminates database correlation errors since only one 

                                                
1 In this context, raw source denotes any input to the modeling workstation that is used to assemble the synthetic 
environment; consequently, the data may have undergone some level of post-processing (such as image color-
balancing, image ortho-rectification, etc.) or may be in a specific source interchange format (such as SIF, SEDRIS, 
etc.) 



 

10 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

database is used to represent the same synthetic environment.  A 
runtime database is a device-loadable database format that can be 
processed by a target device.  The CDB Standard defines a format that 
can be entered in runtime by client-devices that conform to the CDB 
standard.  By definition, the CDB Standard addresses all runtime 
database-level correlation errors. 

Correlation, Source DB The degree of informational consistency between the internal datasets 
of a source database produced by a DB generation toolset.  To a large 
extent, the effort expended by a modeler at their DB workstation 
consists in eliminating (or at least reducing) correlation errors arising 
from miss-correlated raw source data. 

Culture See Feature, Cultural. 

Culture, 2D Short for 2D Cultural Feature.  The 2D representation of a man-made 
or natural object (such as a road, a runway, a forest canopy), 
conformed to the terrain. 

Culture, 3D Short for 3D Cultural Feature.  The 3D representation of erect man-
made or natural object (such as buildings, trees, towers) positioned on 
top of and usually conformed to the terrain. 

D  

Data Dictionary  A data dictionary is a collection of descriptions of the data objects or 
items in a data model for the benefit of programmers and others who 
need to refer to them. See 
http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/data-dictionary 

Data Duplication Data logically representing the same information, copied one or more 
times within a complex data structure.  The CDB Standard eliminates 
all duplication of data, i.e., the data appears once and only once within 
the CDB structure. 

Data Normalization Data normalization is the process of reducing data to its canonical 
form. For instance, Database normalization is the process of 
organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize 
redundancy and dependency. 

Data Redundancy Information in the form of data that can readily be derived (within the 
limits of technological/cost reasonability) and re-formatted, or re-
derived from other data. 

Dataset In general, an identifiable collection of data. In modelling and simulation, 
an organized group of related environmental data that cannot be 
broken down into a smaller set used to describe a synthetic 



 

11 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

environment element of the world. 

Database Fidelity Reflects the amount and type of synthetic environmental data needed 
by client-devices to simulate real-world environmental data with 
greater fidelity.  Consider for instance a simulator client-device 
capable of supporting a single-surface earth skin representation versus 
one capable of representing a multi-surface earth skin that represent 
tunnels, bathymetric data, location-dependent tide heights, etc. 

Database Assembly In many database tools, the generation of the terrain plays a pivotal 
role in the database assembly process because all of the cultural 
features are conformed and constrained to the terrain representation 
and structure.  Most client-devices in existence today have 
interdependent terrain geometry, raster imagery and culture; as a 
result of this, most tools in use today resolve these inter-dependencies 
during this critical and computationally expensive database assembly 
step.   

Database Generation 
Facility (DBGF) 

A geographically co-located group of workstation(s), computer 
platforms, input devices (digitizing tablets, etc.), output devices 
(stereo viewers, etc.), modeling software, visualization software, CDB 
Server, CDB off-line publishing software and any other associated 
software and hardware used for the development/modification of the 
CDB.  The DBGF is used for the purpose of CDB creation and CDB 
updates.  Each workstation is equipped with one or more specialized 
tools.  The tool suite provides the means to generate and manipulate 
the synthetic environment. 

Database Generation 
Timeline 

Elapsed time from availability of Environmental DB requirements 
(geographic extent, fidelity, resolution, etc.) to availability of a 
compliant runtime Environmental DB, ready for use on all client-
devices of a simulator. 

Database Publishing A process (either off-line2 or on-line) where all of differences between 
the tool-native representation and the client-device internal 
representation of the synthetic environment database are resolved.  
During this step, the publisher transforms the assembled database so 
that it satisfies the client-device’s: 

▪ internal formats 
▪ internal data structure and organization 
▪ internal naming conventions 
▪ internal precision and number representation 
▪ data fidelity requirements (typically parameters that match the 

                                                
2 When applied as an off-line process, the term “compilation” is often used instead. 



 

12 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

client-device algorithms) 
▪ performance limitations 
▪ level-of-detail representation and conventions 

Database Publishing, 
Offline 

The process of performing the steps listed above in Database 
Publishing, and then storing the result in a distinct SE database for 
each client-device. (Note that the stored databases are different for 
each client-device type and each vendor type).  In many cases, the 
published databases are proprietary.  

Database Publishing, 
Online 

The process of performing the steps listed above in Database 
Publishing, on-the-fly, based on paging requests of a client-device.  
Since the publishing is performed on-demand, it exists only 
momentarily in memory; it is not stored on disk. 

Database Resolution Informational density (for instance, the number of elevation values 
per km2, pixels per km2, polygons per km2) of a modeled dataset. 

Data Precision Corresponds to the numerical precision (i.e., number of bits allocated) 
used to represent a unit. 

Datum Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, 
the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system. 

Depth Height below the reference surface will have a negative value, which 
would embrace both gravity-related heights and ellipsoidal heights.

hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the globe. “cell” 
aka “tile” or ”geocell”

Elevation Synonym for “height” 

Environmental Data 
Coding Specification 

An Environmental Data Coding Specification provides a mechanism 
to specify the environmental "things" that a particular data model is 
intended to represent. That is, a feature such as building could be 
represented alternatively as a Man-made Point Feature, a Radar RCS 
polar diagram or as an OpenFlight model, or some combination of 



 

13 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

these.  The representation of these is chosen by the data modeler and 
is orthogonal to the semantic of the "thing" that is represented (and its 
location). The provision of such a "thing" results in a shared 
understanding of "what the thing is and what it potentially means" to 
all participating applications. 

Environmental Data 
Representation Model 

A data representation model (EDRM) is a description used to provide 
identification of all environmental data elements within a system, 
including their attributes and the logical relationships between data 
elements. 

Environmental DB, 
Runtime 

A device-loadable database format that can be processed by a target 
device.  The CDB Standard defines a format that can be entered in 
runtime by simulator client-devices that conform to the CDB 
Standard. 

Eyepoint A single point (monocular) location of the observer’s eye relative to a 
scene representation.  Usually a point within the cockpit of the 
simulated aircraft or vehicle. 

Eyepoint, Pilot The normal eyepoint position when the pilot’s seat is adjusted 
properly for flying the aircraft.  Defined by the aircraft manufacturer 
for each pilot seating position.  The eyepoint(s) for which the display 
design is normally optimized and typically used for display testing 
purposes. 

F  

FDD Feature Data Dictionary 

Feature Abstraction of real world phenomena 
NOTE A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or 
feature instance is used when only one is meant. [adapted from ISO 
19101] 

Feature, Areal (aka 
polygon) 

A representation of closed area-oriented features conformed relative 
to the terrain such as forested areas, fields.  The information includes 
areal feature type identification, location, orientation, 2D geometry, 
connectivity, attribution and other surface characteristics relevant to 
simulation. 

Feature, Cultural Human made (constructed) point, lineal and areal features. 

Feature, Lineal 
(previously Feature, 
Linear) 

A geographic feature that can be represented by a line or set of lines. 
For example, rivers, roads within a pizza delivery area, and electric 
and telecommunication networks are all lineal features.  The 
information includes lineal feature type identification, location, 



 

14 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

orientation, geometry, connectivity, attribution and other surface 
characteristics relevant to simulation. See also LineString 

Feature, Point The representation of a single location in space or on the earth’s 
surface.  A Point Feature consists of a single <latitude, longitude> 
coordinate with or without an elevation and related properties such as 
feature type and orientation.  See also point. 

Flat Earth Jargon used in simulation community to signify the projection of the 
earth ellipsoid onto a flat surface.  The flat Earth approximation 
retains terrain relief but eliminates the effects of Earth surface 
curvature.  If you stay in the vicinity of a given fixed point, it may be 
a good enough approximation to consider the earth as "flat", and use a 
North, East, Down rectangular coordinate system with origin at the 
fixed point. 

FOM Federation Object Model 

FOV, Field of View The horizontal and vertical subtended angles from a designated 
eyepoint to the boundaries of a visual system channel (channel FOV) 
or all channels (system FOV). 

G  

Geocell Short form for geographic cell.  Synonymous with a single tile in the 
CDB tiled structure. A 1o of latitude by 1 o of longitude area on the 
surface of the earth.   At the equator, this corresponds to an area of 
approximately of 111,319m × 111,319m.  (See also CDB Geocell). 

Geodetic Datum datum describing the relationship of a two- or three-dimensional 
coordinate system to the Earth (ISO 19111) 

Geographic Extent An earth surface area that has been modeled. 

Geographic Projection coordinate conversion from an ellipsoidal coordinate system to a 
plane 

Geometric Primitive Geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous 
element of space 

Geospecific Model A model is said to be geospecific if it is instanced once and only once 
within a CDB.  Geospecific models usually correspond to unique (in 
either shape, size, texture, materials or attribution), man-made, real-
world 3D cultural features. 

Geotypical Model A model is said to be geotypical if it instanced multiple times within a 
CDB data store.  Geotypical models correspond to representative (in 



 

15 
Copyright© 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

shape, size, texture, materials and attribution) models of real-world 
manmade or natural 3D cultural features. 

Grid This is a grid network composed of two or more sets of curves in 
which the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets 
in an algorithmic way NOTE The curves partition a space into grid 
cells.. [ISO 19123:2007] 

Grid point Point located at the intersection of two or more curves in a grid 

H  

Height Distance of a point from a chosen reference surface measured upward 
along a line perpendicular to that surface. [ISO 19111] Note 1 to 
entry: A height below the reference surface will have a negative 
value, which would embrace both gravity-related heights and 
ellipsoidal heights. 

HLS High Level Architecture [IEEE Std 1516TM] 

I  

Illumination One or more sources of illumination for the objects in the scene, such 
as daylight, twilight, landing lights. 

Illumination, ambient The non-directional component of illumination for the scene.  
Daylight, twilight and moonlight have ambient components over the 
entire scene.  Landing lights typically provide ambient-type 
illumination over a limited area of the scene. 

Illumination, 
Directional 

Scene illumination provided by an illumination source at a particular 
position or direction in the environmental database spatial frame.  The 
effect on object luminance depends on the angle between the 
illumination source and object surface normal. 

Imagery A likeness or presentation of any natural or manmade feature or related 
object of activity and the positional data acquired at the same time the 
likeness or representation was acquired. (NSG Geospatial Core Metadata 
Profile) 

J  

K  

L

M  

Material Shorthand for either Base Material or Composite Material. 

Material, Base Symbolic representation of a basic material in the CDB.  Basic 
materials are inputs to production or manufacturing processes.  They 
are often raw, that is unprocessed, but are sometimes processed before 
being used in more advanced production processes.  Basic materials 
represent the substances out of which a thing is or can be made.  
Examples are materials such as steel, aluminum, copper, sand, soil, 
stone, glass, concrete, wood, water, rubber.  Base materials are chosen 
for their relevance to simulation. 

Material, Composite A symbolic representation that corresponds to a composite material 
that is made up of a primary substrate and one or more secondary 
substrates.  Each substrate is composed of one or more base materials 
entries.  The substrates can each be assigned a thickness. 

Metadata Data about data.  Metadata describes how and when and by whom a 
particular set of data was collected. This is often referred to as 
“provenance”. Metadata may also define how the data is formatted. 

Metadata element Discrete unit of metadata. (NSG Geospatial Core Metadata Profile) 

Mission Functions A set of low-level simulator query functions performed on the 
synthetic environment, including such functions as Height Above 
Terrain (HAT), Height Above Culture (HAC), Collision Detection 
(CD), Line-Of-Sight (LOS), Laser Range Finder (LRF), etc. 

Model  A term which stands for the 2D or 3D representation of features

(exclusive of the terrain and/or bathymetry itself) within the synthetic 
environment database.  Models can be statically positioned on the 
terrain (i.e., a cultural feature), or they are freely moving (i.e., a 
moving model).  Models are often a 3D representation of a man-made 
or a natural object positioned and conformed relative to the terrain.  
The information includes its geometry, articulations, raster imagery 
(texture, normal map, light map, etc.), lighting systems, and other 
characteristics relevant to simulation. 

Model, 2D Refers to the modeled representations of 2D features; i.e., lineal or 
areal features that have no significant height with respect to the 
underlying terrain; 2D Models generally conform to the terrain 
profile. 

Model, 3D Refers to the modeled representation of 3D features that can be 
readily distinguished from the underlying terrain.  In the case where 
they are unique, they are referred to as GSModels. In the case where 
they are instanced, they are referred to as GTModels.  3DModels 
capable of movement are called MModels.  In the case where 
MModels are positioned by the modeler, they are called statically-
positioned MModels. 

Model, Cultural  A model that is statically positioned on the terrain or bathymetry skin.  
Cultural models are often a 3D representation of a man-made or a 
natural object positioned and conformed relative to the terrain.  The 
information includes its geometry, articulations, raster imagery 
(texture, normal map, light map, etc.), lighting systems, and other 
characteristics relevant to simulation. 

Model, GS The geospecific representation of a cultural feature that is unique 
within the CDB. 

Model, GT The geotypical representation of a cultural feature that can be reused 
several times throughout the CDB. 

Model, Moving  A model that is not fixed at one location in the synthetic environment 
database.  The simulation host can update the position and orientation 
of a moving model at every simulation iteration cycle.  A moving 
model is a 3D representation of manmade and natural objects free to 
move.   

Model-LOD Refers to a specific level of detail of the modeled representation of a 
feature; a general term encompassing both 2D and 3D Model-LOD 

Model-LOD, 2D Refers to a specific level of detail of a 2D model. 

Model-LOD, 3D Refers to a specific level of detail of a 3D model.

R  

Raster In general, usually rectangular pattern of parallel scanning lines forming or 
corresponding to the display on a cathode ray tube. In the GIS community 
and in its simplest form, a raster consists of a matrix of cells (or 
pixels) organized into rows and columns (or a grid) where each cell 
contains a value representing information 

Raw Source A term generally used to describe the data imported into the database 
generation workstation for the purpose of off-line assembling and 
building the synthetic environment.  The level of pre-processing 
applied to the source may vary considerably (from raw data directly 
from sensors such as unprocessed satellite raster imagery or photos to 
data directly usable by simulator client-devices).  Source data need 
not be in digital form (e.g., photos).
