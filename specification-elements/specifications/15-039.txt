The GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) has identified a need for the ability to 
store tiled gridded elevation data in a GeoPackage. This document describes the vision 
and proposed approach, which is an extension to the OGC GeoPackage Encoding

1. Scope 

The GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) has identified a need for the ability to 
store tiled gridded elevation data in a GeoPackage. This capability will be used to support 
use cases such as the following: 

 Visualization 
o 2D (hillshade, color relief, slope) 
o 3D (supporting changing view angles and level of detail) 

 Analysis 
o Viewshed and line-of-sight 
o Cross-country mobility (off-road routing) 
o Site suitability and planning (slope analysis such as helicopter landing 

zones) 
o 3D geometry representations of features (ground-based, airspace) 
o Terrain association (associating images to mapped locations) 
o Augmented reality training 

Ideally this capability will be relatively easy to implement and will be suitable for a wide 
variety of computing environments including the mobile/handheld computing 
environment. 

This document describes the vision and proposed approach, which is an extension to the 
OGC GeoPackage Encoding Standard. The SWG proposes leveraging the existing 
structure for raster tiles using TIFF files as the container for the elevation values 
themselves. 

We acknowledge that the proposed approach will not support certain applications that 
require a high degree of precision and/or accuracy (e.g., targeting).

3. Terms and Definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is 
based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 
to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard. 

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply. 

viewshed1 
the geographical area that is visible from a location 

4. Conventions 

This sections provides details and examples for any conventions used in the document. 
Examples of conventions are symbols, abbreviations, use of XML schema, or special 
notes regarding how to read the document. 

GPKG: GeoPackage. When followed by a number, this refers to a numbered requirement 
from the GeoPackage Encoding Standard. 

5. Process 

The SWG developed the tiled gridded approach through a series of private and public 
interactions between March and May 2015. The SWG email list and teleconferences were 
the primary means of discussion and decision making. All decisions were made by the 
SWG as per OGC policies and procedures. A number of votes were taken to ensure that 
there was consensus. 

Note that the SWG members made a concerted effort to solicit and encourage public 
feedback. Individual decision points were opened up as issues on the GitHub repository2 
and this led to feedback from a number of OGC and non-OGC members. Additional 
feedback was solicited through the 3D GeoPackage Working Group sponsored by U.S.

Army Geospatial Center. (This working group brought together representatives from a 
number of U.S. Army programs with an interest in elevation data.) This public feedback 
helped us identify good ideas and reach consensus.  

6. Proposed Approach 

The SWG proposes extending the existing GeoPackage Encoding Standard and to 
leverage the existing structure for raster tiles. The existing tile set tables3 are used as 
normal with the following changes: 

 A new value of “2D-gridded-coverage” is allowed in the “data_type” column of 
the “gpkg_contents” table. 

 Create a new table called “gpkg_2D_gridded_coverage_ancillary” as described in 
Table 1. 

 Add new columns to tile set description tables as described in Table 2 (we foresee 
these columns being used in other extensions which also leverage the tiles 
approach). When used for elevation data the new columns have the following 
values:  

o content: “tiled-elevation” 
o ancillary_table: “gpkg_elevation_ancillary” 
o ancillary_key: (foreign key to row in gpkg_elevation_ancillary) 

 Instead of JPEG or PNG files, elevation data is stored in TIFF files. These files 
are constrained as follows: 

o Either 16-bit signed integer or 32-bit floating point 
o One sample per pixel 
o LZW compression may be used 
o No subfiles or internal tiles 

 Use ISO metadata (optional) to encode other details about the elevation data. 

7. Next Steps 

The SWG proposes the following next steps: 

 Discuss this proposal in the broader community (outside the SWG itself) to reach 
a consensus on approach. 

 Plan and perform interoperability experiments that allow implementers the 
opportunity to develop compliant software and demonstrate its interoperability 
(this could be as part of OWS 12 or in an independent interoperability experiment 
or plugfest) 

 Document the extension as part of an updated version of the GeoPackage 
Encoding Standard or as a separate document

8. Frequently Asked Questions 

Q: What about GeoTIFF? 

A: The SWG was just looking for a simple container to hold the elevation values. The 
geo-referencing is handled by the tile structure so GeoTIFF would have been redundant. 
TIFF is self-describing (a plus for many SWG members) but is otherwise a fairly simple 
format with broad API support (libtiff, etc.). Requiring GeoTIFF would have 
significantly increased the cost and complexity of the approach. This approach is also 
consistent with other OGC standards such as Web Map Tile Service (WMTS). 

Q: What about supporting other types of coverages? 

A: The SWG foresees this approach being used for other types of coverages (for 
example, in the weather domain). However, since elevation is the top priority, the SWG 
chose to focus on that single use case for now. Once the approach is proven, it should be 
easy to support other types of coverages as well.
