What is the OGC Testbed 10? 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is the only international organization that brings 
industry players together to help organizations manage risks and difficulties that relate to 
communication about real-world location and mobility. The OGC combines rapid 
prototyping, standards development, coordination with other standards organizations, and 
aggressive standards marketing to address users' challenging geospatial integration 
problems. 

Over the last 18 years, the OGC's Member organizations have developed a unique and 
proven interoperability testbed process that saves invested time and money while creating 
new business opportunities and driving innovation. The OGC Interoperability Program 
plans and conducts plugfests, pilots and the annual OGC Testbed. 

This report summarizes the results of OGC Testbed 10. Testbed 10 sponsorship totaled 
$1.2 million USD and attracted in-kind contributions by participants of approximately 
$1.6 million USD for a 2.3x return on investment. Testbed requirements were provided 
by eleven (11) sponsors from the US, Canada and Europe. Requirements ranged from 
environmental management and civil government mapping to maintaining common 
operating pictures in disaster zones and battlefields. Twenty-nine (29) participating 
organizations, working on specific interoperability problems detailed in the sponsors' use 
cases and scenarios, delivered extraordinary value in the following areas: 

 Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI): Increase Geospatial community 
interoperability by building on Testbed 9 CCI work in semantic mediation, volunteer 
geographic information (VGI), provenance and data quality, and the Global 
Gazetteer. Explore the potential of interoperability in the hydrology domain utilizing 
semantic mediation and ontologies to more easily share and visualize geospatial data. 

 Open Mobility: Explore the geospatial standards requirements needed to support the 
growing mobile environment where client applications are mobile and information 
services are mobile and increasingly distributed across cloud infrastructures. The 
Open Mobility thread addressed these requirements while leveraging on the work 
achieved in Testbed 9 in the areas of OGC GeoPackage and GeoPackaging services 
and new OWS Context encodings. 

 Aviation: Demonstrate use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model 
(AIXM), the Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM), and Weather Information 
Exchange Model (WXXM) to build on the work accomplished in prior OGC testbeds 
to advance the applications of OGC Web Services standards in next generation air 
traffic management systems to support European and US aviation modernization 
programs.

OGC® Testbed 10 Summary Engineering Report 

Summary OGC Testbed 10 

1 Overview 

The OGC Testbed 10 was an initiative of OGC’s Interoperability Program to 
collaboratively extend and demonstrate OGC’s baseline for geospatial interoperability. 
The majority of work for Testbed 10 was conducted between October 2013 and April 
2014. Key outcomes are: 

 40 Software Components (servers, clients, tools and other applications) were 
implemented and used in interoperability testing. 

 19 Engineering Reports (ERs) were written. Testbed 10 ERs were either technical 
specifications or reports regarding testing and analysis. Several Change Requests 
were also developed as recommendations for changes to existing standards. These 
CRs were entered into the OGC’s change request tracker:  
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cr 

 Testbed 10 ERs were posted to the OGC Standards Program Pending Documents 
archive and have either been approved for public release or are being reviewed by 
OGC TC members for public release. Engineering reports approved for public 
release are accessible on the web here: 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/per 

 11 Sponsoring organizations defined requirements for Testbed 10. The sponsors’ 
requirements were captured in the Request For Quotations/Call For Participation 
(RFQ/CFP) document that was released by OGC 15 July 2013 seeking 
organizations that wished to participate in the Testbed. 

 40 organizations in total participated in some aspect of Testbed 10. Roles for 
organizations in Testbed 10 included sponsors, participants and architects.

6.2 Key Accomplishments 

The key accomplishments of the Aviation thread activities are: 

 Designed and implemented a GML 3.2 based encoding for FIXM 2.0 – a 
GML 3.2 Application Schema for FIXM 2.0 was developed and tested. This work 
is fundamental to serving FIXM data using an OGC WFS 2.0 compliant 
implementation.  

 Developed application patterns for disseminating updates FIXM 2.0 features 
– Since FIXM 2.0 does not provide a temporal concept equivalent to the one 
defined for AIXM 5.1, an alternative approach for the publish/subscribe based 
dissemination of FIXM features was developed in order to enable the integration 
of FIXM data into the Aviation service architecture. 

 Integration of Weather Data – Access to NOAA’s weather data was made 
available using an OGC Web Coverage Service. For the first time within an OGC 
Testbed, the returned weather data were then integrated into the Aviation 
scenarios. Backed by NOAA’s Web-gridded Document Service and encoded as 
WXXM, the WCS instance provided forecast weather data demonstrating new 
uses while applied in interesting use cases and scenarios. 

 Terrain Data Exchange – A set of recommendations on exchange formats to 
meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 15 and ADQ 
requirements; strategies to overcome cross-border differences in terrain data due 
to differences in national geodetic systems and provision of seamless terrain data; 
and demonstrated approaches to provide web-based access to eTOD data in an 
INSPIRE compliant way. 

 Binding AIXM to Development tools – Demonstrated automated creation of 
generated AIXM data bindings for established programming languages; 
documented issues observed while creating these bindings, integration into 
development tools (IDEs, application servers) and an evaluation in terms of 
language integration and performance.

6.3 Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 

The Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) thread was focused on tasks to build on 
interoperability within and between communities sharing geospatial data and to advance 
semantic mediation approaches for data discovery, access and use of heterogeneous data 
models and heterogeneous metadata models.  The CCI Thread investigated the creation 
of domain ontologies and tools to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic data 
provided voluntarily by individuals. In addition, the CCI Thread demonstrated integration 
across all OGC web services with the intent to provide a better understanding of service 
content and the relationships or associations that exist between OGC services and 
resources/content. To this end, the thread addressed the following main tasks: 

 Ontology – Created an ontology that renders shared vocabulary and taxonomy, 
which models a domain with the definition of objects/concepts, as well as their 
properties and relations.

 Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) – The VGI effort continued on the 
work of Testbed 9 to expand the use of OGC services and standards for VGI 
access, data linking, and rule-based conflation based on results from attribute and 
spatial queries of gazetteer data. 

 Gazetteer - The Virtual Global Gazetteer effort extended the Single Point of 
Entry Global Gazetteer (SPEGG) work from Testbed 9, building on the 
framework established in that testbedand expanding gazetteer functionality to 
include gazetteer conflation and semantic gazetteer linking. 

 WPS conflation and provenance – Advanced data and service discovery. 
Investigated new and/or existing services using the benefit of semantic mediation 
approaches to support discovery of pertinent services or data collections.  

 Linked WPS and Decision Rules – Developed a framework for WPS to 
investigate diverse data sets and build relational linkages and, when appropriate, 
invoke other services (e.g. WPS Conflation). 

 Profiles – Developed and tested implementations based on the latest versions of 
the Defence Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG) and the National 
System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG) profiles of OGC Web Services.  

 Hydro Model Interoperability – Demonstrated interoperability among 
hydrographic and hydrologic data sources by linking model concepts across 
different hydrologic models to facilitate retrieval and delivery of data in a selected 
model format.
