i. Abstract 
Sustainable development, "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs,1" will be accomplished by 
balancing social, economic and environmental objectives.  In this paper the authors 
explain that rigorous standards for communicating environmental data are absolutely 
essential to enable social and economic progress in the Age of the Environment2 – the 
Anthropocene Epoch3 – in which humanity's expanding footprint has become the main 
cause of change in the planet's geology, water bodies, atmosphere and biosphere. The 
authors argue for a concerted and ongoing global effort to 1) define data communication 
and system interoperability requirements for environmental science, business and policy, 
and then 2) develop and implement consensus-derived, free and open environmental 
Information Technology (IT) standards that meet those requirements and that co-evolve 
with the larger IT standards framework and advances in IT.

environment, green IT, Anthropocene, standards, WaterML 2.0, OGC standards 

iii. Preface 
One of Green IT's most important enablers – open standards – is seldom discussed. The authors 
propose an agenda for standards research, development and implementation to underpin 
communication of spatial data in support of sustainable development. 

This document was written and reviewed by staff and members of the OGC to 1) describe 
the work of the OGC as it relates to sustainable development and 2) call for collaboration 
across a broad spectrum of sustainable development stakeholders to carry this work to the 
next level.  

The paper includes overviews of existing standards, current work on new standards, 
technology trends affecting environmental standards, and descriptions of a few of the 
standards that are needed but do not yet exist. The authors argue for the development and 
use of domain-specific but technically interrelated IT standards for communication and 
data integration within and between domains that focus on the environment. These 
domains include the Earth sciences as well as the environmental response and 
management domains such as emissions monitoring, offsetting, trading, taxing and 
regulating; physical infrastructure monitoring; public health; embedded energy 
tracking/reduction, disaster response; etc.

Environmental data is spatial data, that is, data describing features and phenomena and 
their locations relative to Earth coordinate reference systems. It is important to keep in 
mind, however, that "maps" and even GIS (geographic information systems) do not 
capture the full potential of digital environmental data. To secure humanity's future we 
need to put data describing natural and built environments – micro, meso and macro, 
indoor and outdoor – into the broader Web sphere, and we need consensus-derived, open, 
international encoding and interface standards and best practices so producers and users 
of that data can benefit from the extraordinary and rapidly advancing capabilities of IT. 
The Earth is a "flux coupler", simultaneously coupling complex dynamic Earth system 
processes of many kinds. The ability to introduce outputs from one Earth system model 
as inputs into another Earth system model improves our ability to model these complex 
interlinked and dynamic systems.4 The nature of digital technology and the 
interrelatedness of Earth systems require that geoscience and environmental management 
domains use data encodings and geoprocessing software interfaces that are designed to be 
useful in holistic Earth system modeling, cross-disciplinary studies and longitudinal 
studies. Data provenance, quality, archival, semantics are important, as are the evolving 
trends in IT and these trends impacts on workflows. 

The authors describe progress in the area of spatial IT standards and call for a concerted 
effort by academia, research funding agencies, NGOs, government and industry to build 
the required open standards framework. Analysis of data communication in current 
environmental workflows will yield specific technical requirements, and the authors call 
for funding of such analysis so that it may begin. The authors urge and anticipate future 
work and leadership in bringing together international partners who can build bridges 
connecting domain subgroups and connecting domains so that they may begin building 
common purpose, common understandings, and then standard interfaces, encodings and 
best practices.

1. Introduction – Data communication for sustainable development  

The Anthropocene is an informal term suggesting that human activities have now 
affected the planet to such a great extent that they mark the beginning of a new geological 
epoch. In this new epoch, world peace and prosperity, and perhaps our survival, will 
depend on how well we collaboratively manage our interactions, not just with each other, 
but also with the Earth's atmosphere, water, soil, geology, energy resources and non-
human life forms.  

 

Figure 1: Now, in the Anthropocene, human activity is the dominant factor effecting change in 
the Earth's rocks and soils, water bodies, atmosphere and flora and fauna. We need to tune and 
sharpen our information technology for the purpose of managing change to benefit present and 
future generations. 



 

 7  Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 
  

We mustn't discount the fact that we have already begun managing our interactions with 
Earth systems: For example, fewer new dams are being built, energy efficiency is 
improving, controls have begun to be placed on pesticides and herbicides, and early 
programs are in place to limit CO2 emissions. We are also getting better at managing our 
responses to Earth systems' impacts on us. Our science, technology and collaboration 
have brought us steadily improving disaster response plans and increasingly accurate 
weather forecasts, algal bloom reports, climate change predictions, soil moisture 
monitoring etc. that help us to be resilient in the face of Earth system events. 

Progress toward sustainability has significantly depended on electronic information 
technology (IT) that helps us develop and share knowledge about Earth changes and our 
role in those changes. To build on what has been accomplished, in this paper we argue for 
the development and use of domain-specific but technically interrelated IT standards for 
communication and data integration within and between domains that focus on the 
environment. These domains include each of the Earth sciences and many of the 
environmental response and management domains: emissions (trading, taxing and 
regulating), infrastructure monitoring, public health, embedded energy 
tracking/reduction, etc.  

 

Figure 2: We get a rapidly increasing number of terabytes of data from an explosion of sensors, 
satellites, citizens, models etc. However, data has little value if it can't be easily discovered, 
assessed, accessed, aggregated, combined, passed from system to system, etc.

Environmental science, education, business and policy require Earth observations and 
measurements, but data is not enough. Equally important is the requirement to 
communicate and process those measurements to turn them into information, knowledge, 
wisdom, policy and business. Maps are also not enough. They put geographic 
information into a pre-digital paper space. We need to put environmental data – micro, 
meso and macro, indoor and outdoor – into IT space, and we need to be smarter about 
how we do this so we can benefit from the extraordinary and rapidly advancing 
capabilities of information technology.  

The Earth is a "flux coupler", simultaneously coupling dynamic processes of many kinds. 
Our ability to model complex, dynamic and interlinked Earth systems5 depends on our 
ability to transfer outputs (along with metadata – data about the data – including 
measures of error and uncertainty) from one model as inputs into another model. The 
interrelatedness of Earth systems requires that the disciplines focused on different 
systems – geology, hydrology, meteorology, etc. – use data encodings and geoprocessing 
software interfaces that are designed to be useful in cross-disciplinary and longitudinal 
studies. 

Communication and large-scale data collection and processing depend on the ability of 
systems to interoperate through standards-based interfaces and encodings. 
Standardization means, “agreeing on a common system.” In many cases these necessary 
standards don't currently exist. Despite the success of the Open Geospatial Consortium in 
raising the profile of these issues, more needs to be done to raise awareness of the 
required standards and the benefits they could bring. This paper provides examples of 
how this standardization work is currently being done and outlines a roadmap for 
developing a unified set of environmental communication standards. The authors call on 
stakeholders to help us add detail to the roadmap and enlist domain experts in building a 
unified standards platform for sustainable development. 

2. What needs to be measured and communicated for sustainable 
development? 
Researchers studying socio-technical aspects of sustainability could make important 
contributions by addressing this question. Insights from an analysis of what needs to be 
measured and communicated would act as a stimulus to businesses, organizations and 
government data policy experts to partner in data coordination committees. It would act 
as a stimulus for Standards Development Organizations to begin gathering 
interoperability requirements and developing standards. With this progress, the potential 
for businesses to explore innovative offerings and business models in anticipation of 
projected market opportunities arising from enhanced information flows would be 
enhanced.

climate models.

The domains for which researchers might assess value chains to discern their 
environmental data communication needs and opportunities include: 

 Greenhouse gases: sources, sinks, offsets6 and effects  
 Pollution: sources, sinks, mitigation efforts and effects 
 Wastes: toxic wastes, industrial wastes available as feed stock for industrial 

processes or products, waste mitigation sites and processes 
 Physical Infrastructure: buildings, capital projects, transportation, communication, 

energy facilities etc. – for efficiency, environmental safety and "emergy" 
(quantification of energy and resources embedded in structures) 

 Resources: fossil fuels, biofuels, geophysical (water, wind, ores etc.); biological 
resources (fish, crops, forests, soil etc.), electromagnetic spectrum, temperature 
deltas and microclimates, ecosystem services (cooling, carbon capture, oxygen 
production, air filtering, groundwater recharge, silencing, wind breaks, etc.) 
provided by natural features such as waterways, forests, green space and urban 
trees 

 Hazards: radiation; toxic wastes; crime; fire, flood, earthquake, drought, wind and 
ice storms; occupational hazards, hazards from unsafe physical infrastructure 

 Health: environmental health; disease demographics; public safety statistics; 
health stressors; health facility siting, design and operation 

The IT standards community cannot undertake this effort without the leadership of the 
domain experts. In each of these domains, stakeholders, including environmental 
researchers, government agencies and businesses, need to reach consensus on 
requirements for shared ontologies7 and data integration.  

This work would proceed by exploring workflows and use cases involved in a wide array 
of present day environmental activities, such as:  

 Cap and trade schemes and valuation of, for example, carbon offset projects 
 City rating systems (STAR8, C409, ISO 3712010, ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol 

for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions11, etc.) 
 Environmental regulation, taxes and impact statements 
 Industrial waterways reclamation 

                                                
6 CarbonML, an encoding standard that would, for example, enable international exchange, verification, 
assessment and commerce in carbon offsets, has been proposed to the OGC membership.

 Integrated community energy systems 
 Oil spills 
 Resource/waste circulation 
 Sustainable agriculture 
 Triple bottom line accounting 

Analysis of such activities by IT standards developers would result in environmental data 
communication requirements – interoperability requirements – to be addressed in 
interoperability test-beds and standards working groups.  Significant societal and 
economic returns could derive from relatively small strategic investments applied to such 
activity. As described below, with WaterML 2.0, GeoSciML, PipelineML and others, this 
work has begun. 

The Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev first postulated major cycles of innovation in 
1925. Dr James Bradfield Moody, author of The Sixth Wave, argues that we have now 
entered a sixth major wave of innovation — that of resource efficiency.12 Global 
warming and pollution-induced health problems are consequences of terrible 
inefficiencies. Much old physical infrastructure is inefficient and in disrepair and much 
new infrastructure, hopefully more efficient, needs to be built to serve expanding urban 
populations. The environment and the economy are degraded by an abundance of usable 
but unused industrial byproducts13. The simple facts of resource depletion and population 
growth underscore the widespread need for innovations in resource efficiency. Progress 
toward efficiency (including but not limited to economic efficiency) is a critical element 
in Sustainable Development and it depends on more efficient communication of 
environmental data. 

Urgent discipline-specific and project-specific data integration efforts don't wait for 
international standards, and thus ad hoc encodings and interface specifications proliferate. 
A few of these come into wide use, but without a concerted international effort to identify 
and involve a critical mass of key stakeholders, important domain requirements are 
ignored in ad hoc standards development and thus most of the integration work is not 
reusable and must be repeated for the next project. 

The next section explains why environmental accounting will motivate development of 
the environmental domain encoding standards that will be critical to sustainable 
development.

3. Environmental accounting needs indices based on trusted data 

 

Figure 3: Sustainable development will impact commerce, government oversight, taxes and 
perhaps monetary systems. All of these require a unitary system of environmental data encoding 
standards that enable trustable, transparent and digitally useful communication of environmental 
measurements. 

Science-based analysis of environmental factors has little effect on the environment until 
the analyses affect the way business is done. The US Environmental Protection Agency's 
"An Introduction to Environmental Accounting"14 begins with this definition: 

"The term environmental accounting has many meanings and uses. Environmental 
accounting can support national income accounting, financial accounting, or internal 
business managerial accounting. This primer focuses on the application of 
environmental accounting as a managerial accounting tool for internal business 
decisions. Moreover, the term 'environmental cost' has at least two major dimensions: 
(1) it can refer solely to costs that directly impact a company's bottom line (here 
termed 'private costs'), or (2) it also can encompass the costs to individuals, society, 
and the environment for which a company is not accountable (here termed 'societal 
costs'). The discussion in this primer concentrates on private costs because that is 
where companies starting to implement environmental accounting typically begin. 
However, much of the material is applicable to societal costs as well." 

Environmental accounting and environmental auditing will depend on standards for 
environmental evidence, and these will require widely accepted measurements and 
trustable, transparent and digitally useful description and communication of 
measurements. Trustable, transparent and useful measurement will be necessary in policy 
making and regulation; in commerce, such as emissions trading and "cradle-to-cradle" or 
"waste as a resource" transactions (see "circular economy")15; in documenting the value 
of a company's goodwill during an acquisition; and in auditing to verify value and 
compliance in all such activities.

Environmental IT standards can be used as a basis for indices that simplify and 
standardize environmental accounting tasks. Indices exist for other accounting purposes 
such as quantifying liquidity16 and summarizing changes in prices17. Environmental data 
encoding and software interface standards can reduce the complexity of environmental 
information in transparent ways so that accountants and auditors can use simply stated 
derived indices to produce, compare, aggregate and monetize results.  

Eurostat18, the statistical office of the European Union, is currently working to develop an 
environmental accounting framework19 to: 

 Track the links between the environment and the economy at EU, national, sector 
and industry level. 

 Measure what impacts the economy has on the environment (e.g. pollution) and 
how the environment contributes to the economy (e.g. use of raw materials, 
resource efficiency, etc.) by using the accounting framework and concepts of the 
national accounts. 

 List, in quantifiable terms, for example, the amount of pollution produced by 
different industries, which may in turn be compared with employment and the 
value of output produced by these industries. 

Environmental accounting will require much more widespread and organized collection 
and communication of environmental data than current practices make possible. As 
described below, data will come from citizens' wireless devices and non-dedicated sensor 
webs as well as sensor webs, citizens, and businesses and environmental technologist 
teams dedicated to particular types of data collection. Environmental IT standards will 
play an essential role.  

4. Citizen Science and data quality 

Mass participation in environmental data collection helps raise awareness of 
environmental issues even as it helps to quantify environmental phenomena. Thus it is 
reasonable to assume that participation in environmental data collection by citizens will 
increase over time. 

For citizen science and crowd-sourced data it will be particularly important to have 
collection apps that automatically record and transmit not only the sensor and human

observations but also metadata about those observations20. When data of known 
provenance is aggregated or conflated with data of unknown provenance, the quality of 
the resultant data is less certain than the quality of the data of known provenance, and 
thus "fitness for use" of the data product is less knowable. Steps in human and machine-
executed workflows involving everything from sensor deployment, calibration and data 
reduction to passage of data through environmental models to environmental accounting 
indices will be logged, often automatically, to make data provenance and quality more 
knowable.  

The COBWEB Citizen Observatory Web21, a project of the European Union’s 7th 
Research and Development Framework Programme, researches methods of validating 
and quality assuring crowd-sourced data so that it may be beneficially aggregated with 
reference data from authoritative sources. No single approach to this validation and QA 
process is likely to be adequate and so the research focus is towards developing a multi-
stranded framework that could take input from several discrete sources.22  For example, 
one technique useful in collection of volunteered geographic information (VGI) is 
"interactive direction of the observer". The observer is challenged with questions during 
the recording of observations, reducing the uncertainty associated with the data. 
GeoViQua23 is a European Community Seventh Framework funded project that led to the 
development of the OGC Geospatial User Feedback Standards Working Group.  User 
Feedback metadata can be valuable to quality estimates. 

All data falls somewhere on a scale of precision and accuracy and no data are 100% 
precise and accurate. Users of spatial data and those adding metadata to data too often 
forget that a degree of uncertainty always exists. The GEOViQua studies have shown a 
huge quality deficiency in the recording of metadata even now where the emphasis is on 
the professional data collector.  

It may be that we will need to move towards a much more probabilistic style of working 
using Big Data techniques for finding probabilistic associations between data items rather 
than tightly controlled matchings derived through formal ontologies. Nevertheless, those 
devising such Big Data techniques will benefit from also accessing quality estimates 
published as part of a data collection's metadata, and such estimates derive much of their 
value from compliance with international open standards such as ISO 19157 and ISO 
19115 that define how quality has been calculated. Much work remains in development 

                                                
20 Metadata is the first step of putting an observation into context. The context is not necessarily metadata, 
but can (hopefully and necessarily) be reproduced using it. Once context is known, data becomes 
meaningful.

of such environmental standards, including integration with still-emerging standards such 
as UNCertML.24 

5. Open Data and sustainable development 

Open interface and encoding standards are a critical requirement for Open Data.  

In Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) efforts around the world, governments have wisely 
invested in gathering thematic data into databases and making those databases searchable 
and accessible by citizens for a wide variety of purposes. SDI efforts are motivated by the 
realization that in the Information Age, shared data is an integral part of infrastructure, a 
resource that contributes to national wealth. The more it is used, the more valuable it 
becomes. 

The Internet can provide open access to data in SDIs and also, potentially, to a much 
larger array of spatially referenced data gathered from citizens and diverse distributed 
sensors and databases. Discovery, assessment, access and use all depend on standards 
implemented in the service of policies and business models.  

"Radical reuse," "amplification of collective intelligence," "data-driven intelligence," and 
"virtual experiments" are some of the terms used to describe Open Data efforts such as 
the PolyMath Project25, the Allen Brain Atlas26, Galaxy Zoo27, GenBank28, the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey29, and Medline3031. In the geosciences, we have OneGeology32, the 
U.S. Geoscience Information Network33 and the Ocean Observatories Initiative34. We 
need much more geoscience Open Data to accomplish what we must to achieve 
sustainable development in the Anthropocene. Some high quality journals are now

requesting that authors provide data together with the manuscripts, and they are 
publishing the data, but these journals are still in the minority of journals. 

Consider how much data development is wasted in the Earth sciences. Often with great 
effort and at great expense, scientists collect data that they use to write papers. The 
papers are preserved in journals, but the data, unless it has been collected and published 
en masse by government agencies, is seldom published and open for wider review and for 
reuse in longitudinal or cross-disciplinary studies. Most of it is lost.  

The open data movement has begun, but effective open data policy and practice depends 
on open interface and encoding standards to provide efficient publishing, discovery, 
assessment, access (with protection and attribution) and use of data.35 Consistent use of 
standard web service interfaces enables these operations to be "chained" in procedures 
that greatly enhance the value of the data and the scope of what can be done with it. 

Data curation36 will become more important as sustainable development becomes more 
dependent on science and open data. Data worth preserving is worth preserving with 
metadata that describes the data, including details about provenance and quality. Also, if 
it is worth preserving, it should be catalogued correctly so it can be found and used. As 
noted above, it should be served through open standard interfaces so it can be used 
efficiently.  

6. Keeping up with rapidly evolving IT  

TCP/IP37, an IT standard, undergirds the Internet. Other IT standards such as HTTP38 and 
XML39 (and the associated HTML40 standard) undergird the Web. Together, these 
fundamental IT standards and many others provide a foundation for the common system 
for communicating geospatial data and geoprocessing instructions, which is specified 
mainly in ISO/TC 211 and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)41 standards. Most 
environmental datums have a location or area, so they are geospatial data42.

OGC Web Service standards43 have brought geospatial technologies – GIS, remote 
sensing, navigation, facilities management etc. – out of their technology-type stovepipes 
and vendor stovepipes into a much larger world of users and possibilities. OGC Web 
Services standards include some of the first Anthropocene-epoch standards of the kind 
we are promoting: The OGC WaterML 2.0, GeoSciML and netCDF encoding standards. 
We describe these exemplars in sections that follow. 

However, not all standards for sustainable development will be Web service44 standards, 
because Web services are surely not the endpoint of IT evolution. During the 1980s 
and1990s, IT was database oriented, and the OGC's first standard, Simple Features for 
SQL, was database oriented. IT progress from 2000-2010 provided the Web services 
foundation that supports OGC Web Services, which depend on XML and the OGC 
Geography Markup Language (GML), an XML grammar for encoding geospatial 
information. OGC Web Services standards will probably be with us for a very long time, 
but the TCP/IP and HTTP standards also provide a platform for new technology 
approaches not bounded by the established Web services paradigm. Currently, these 
include JSON45, REST46, Linked Data47 and the Semantic Web48, all of which offer new 
possibilities and a path to the future. These complement the OGC's OGC Web Services 
standards with new approaches that can use and extend OGC Web Services. Linked data 
and the Semantic Web, in particular, will provide a quantum leap into a new level of IT-
enhanced spatial awareness. Often these new approaches will involve simple point data. 
Schemes based on point data are unlikely to replace more complex spatial representations 
(polygons, grid arrays, 5D fluid models, triangulated irregular networks etc.), but simple 
point data will be useful in many situations, including much of Citizen Science49 and the 
Internet of Things50.  

It's worth noting here that there are different temporal coordinate reference systems just 
as there are different spatial coordinate reference systems. Advances in combined spatio-
temporal reference systems are a focus of work in the OGC.51

We don't know what other geoprocessing and distributed computing requirements and 
innovations will emerge52, but standards will surely play a role in making them useful 
and widely used resources for sustainable development. 

It would be a mistake to assume that IT standards developed to serve near-term 
commercial mass market needs will meet all the digital communication requirements of 
science, commerce and government in an environmental age. While it is true that markets 
drive the evolution of technology, it is also true that fundamental standards shape 
technology and market outcomes. Wouldn't Internet and Web businesses be different if 
HTTP and XML had been specified differently? Standards are developed and evolve to 
meet market needs as those needs are perceived by the standards' developers, but in turn 
the standards probably only survive if those perceptions match the actual and evolving 
needs of the market. The mass market's scale drives investment for innovations and 
efficiencies that become available to science, but the mass market's requirements do not 
necessarily fully encompass the requirements of science or sustainable development. It is 
thus important for individuals and institutions concerned with science and sustainable 
development to participate in standards working groups. 

In Greening through IT – Information Technology for Environmental Sustainability53, 
Bill Tomlinson writes, "IT compresses complexity … by establishing agreed-on 
standards for the cooperation of devices and people." To be more precise, it is not IT 
itself that establishes agreed-on standards for the cooperation of devices and people; 
rather, the standards with the widest benefit derive from the tried and proven social 
processes facilitated by standards organizations to bring IT providers and users together.  
Dominant IT providers' sometimes open (but not consensus-derived) encodings and 
interfaces (or Application Programming Interfaces – APIs) often become important 
standards, but the consensus-derived open standards that provide a foundation for the 
Internet and the Web ultimately have wider value than the open APIs of any closed 
proprietary ecosystem. TCP/IP, HTTP and XML provide a foundation for a larger 
ecosystem of other consensus-derived open standards that extend the capabilities of the 
Internet and Web. The authors of this paper argue for a concerted and ongoing 
global effort to first define interoperability requirements for environmental science, 
business and policy, and then develop and implement consensus-derived, free and 
open environmental IT standards that meet those requirements while co-evolving 
with the larger IT standards framework and advances in IT.  

A concerted effort – systematic collaboration – is absolutely essential. Collaboration is 
necessary to create good standards that are widely implemented. Collaboration in 

                                                
52 There is increasing interest in geospatial filtering and processing through flexible query languages. See 
the OGC Filter Encoding 2.0 Encoding Standard (http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-026r2/09-
026r2.html), the OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS), 
(http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps) for filtering and processing on coverages, and 
GeoSPARQL (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) for filtering and processing of 
metadata.

developing standards also reveals deeper collaboration opportunities and requirements 
that cannot be met by technical standards. This is why standards development is best 
undertaken by both technical experts and policy experts. 

Because the need to address specific spatial information requirements cuts across the 
missions of so many Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) collaborates with other SDOs to achieve spatial interoperability 
outcomes that would be impossible without inter-SDO cooperation. The OGC's 
established alliances54 and history of success in forging alliances with other SDO’s and 
professional organizations position the OGC as an SDO network hub for environmental 
standards development.  

If geospatial data were simple, there would be no need for the OGC. However, it is not. 

 

Figure 4: Developing standards for geospatial data and services requires special 
expertise. 

Ed Lazowska, founding director of the University of Washington’s data-centric eScience 
Institute, says that his goal in hiring eScience Institute faculty has been to hire a breed of 
“pi (π) people.”55 The π symbol has two legs connected at the top. Pi people have a leg in 
each of two disciplines. They are researchers who are equally conversant in two or more 
seemingly disparate fields, such as neuroscience and sociology, and these researchers 
serve as interdisciplinary connectors.

Figure 5: Environmental domain experts with expertise in multiple worlds have great value in the 
development of environmental IT interface and encoding standards.  

Developing environmental standards requires "pi people" who are expert in one or more 
environmental domains and also in IT. The OGC encourages its members and the 
members of other SDOs to cross-participate in different SDO's working groups to address 
the requirements of environmental workflows. Because of the need in sustainable 
development for interdisciplinary and cross-community communication and coordination, 
there is a great need in standards activities for "milking stool people" with a foundation in 
each of three disciplines, one of which is IT, and two of which are different domains or 
different IT standards organizations.  

Most of the environmental standards we anticipate in this paper will be standards 
designed for particular domains of activity and particular "information communities." We 
explore this in the following sections. 

7. Semantic standards and technical standards 

The domain-specific environmental IT standards development we call for in this paper 
will come as two worlds converge: the world of semantic standards (metadata, 
ontologies, data models, etc.) and the world of technical standards (such as the OGC's 
software interfaces and encodings). Several key OGC standards were designed to be 
tailored to suit the needs of particular applications. In this section and the following 
section, we explain why and how environmental information communities (including, so 
far, hydrology, geology, weather/climate, pipelines and 3D urban models) have begun to 
do this tailoring by bringing their semantic standards experts together with technical 
standards experts in OGC working groups. 



 

 20  Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 
  

Figure 6: Important foundational standards are in place, as are domain standards for hydrology, 
geology, weather and soils. Much work remains, however, to create a coherent "system of 
systems" for environmental communication. Progress depends on the commitment and 
participation of communities of interest who have a critical role to play in sustainable 
development. 

7.1 Domain semantics necessitate semantic standards 
Over the last two decades, many information communities have learned the importance 
of data coordination and have learned how to do it. Information communities who depend 
on sharing information often put in place data coordination committees and processes for 
creating and maintaining standard data models56 and metadata content standards. The 
data model used by an information community is their standard way of describing spatial 
information. It provides a data dictionary and related details necessary for the sharing, 
aggregation and comparison of data within the community. Metadata associated with a 
data set includes the data model along with other data about the data – date of collection, 
person or organization responsible for the collection, etc. Data model development 
proceeds as a part of an information community's metadata standards development effort.  

Such standards are often referred to as "semantic standards". Because of these standards, 
different information systems used within the community can "speak the same language". 
Different data sets that use the same data model can be aggregated or compared.  

                                                
56 A deeper discussion of data models, ontologies, conceptual schemas etc. is beyond the scope of this 
paper. See "Ontologies and Data Models – are they the same?" 
http://topquadrantblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/ontologies-and-data-models-are-they.html. 



 

 21  Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium 
  

Semantic standards also facilitate communication between information communities: 
When each community's data model is published and relatively stable, translation 
between different data models is easier and more precise, despite some inevitable loss of 
information. Data models necessarily evolve as information communities evolve, and so 
this data coordination process within and between domains is an ongoing activity. Data 
modelers working with other data modelers are key standards developers for the 
Anthropocene. 

Geospatial standards are important for environmental work because virtually everything 
in our environment has a spatial component and because interactions between 
environmental features and phenomena depend on proximity. In the geospatial world, an 
"information community" is an industry, profession, academic discipline or other domain 
that shares a set of spatial information communication requirements. Because the 
geospatial element is so important, many data coordination efforts have begun in efforts 
to create "spatial data infrastructures." See for example the US Federal Geographic Data 
Committee57 and the European Commission's INSPIRE Directive58. 

7.2 Technical standards hitch environmental standards to IT innovations 
Also over the last two decades, the members of the OGC have developed policies and 
procedures for working together to develop consensus-based open interface and encoding 
standards that provide a way for any two computer systems to request and return any kind 
of spatial data. These "technical standards" are broadly useful within all spatial data 
information communities. They support inter-community communication and they are 
also essential for convergence and integration of different kinds of spatial technologies, 
such as 2D/3D/4D imaging, vector GIS, surveying, CAD, tracking, etc. The members of 
the OGC maximize new standards' viability by working together to promote widespread 
product implementation and market uptake of the standards.  

Like semantic standards, technical standards evolve. The fundamental domain-neutral 
spatial technology standards framework is now in place, but rapid advances in technology 
make OGC members keenly aware that this foundation needs continual attention, as 
described above in the discussion of JSON, RESTful programming approaches and 
linked data. Such industry-wide advances force revision and rethinking of established 
technical standards. Discussions about revision invariably run into the issue of backwards 
compatibility, a standard's lifetime of usefulness, and the importance of stability to both 
technology providers and technology users who have made investments based on the 
standard. These are difficult but important issues. Mature standards development 
organizations and their long-term members have experience in negotiating these issues. 
They also have a keen awareness of the costs and risks associated with letting market 
leaders establish proprietary standards outside of an open consensus process. Industry 
market leaders work in standards organizations because they, like their competitors and

despite their natural desire to "lock in" customers, have business reasons to implement 
and help develop open standards. 

Technical standards are in place that can provide access control, security and certain 
privacy protections, but development also needs to address other issues such as geospatial 
data rights management and, as discussed above, data quality.  

Much work remains in the broad area of technical standards for geospatial 
interoperability, despite the fact that a mature domain-neutral open spatial technology 
standards framework is already largely in place. One reason work remains is that 
technology is advancing so rapidly. Another reason is that new information communities 
keep appearing, as shown in Figure 6 below. 

 

Figure 7: In climate science, as in many domains, new disciplines arise, and they are new 
information communities. Their data models differ, but they need to share data and 
communicate. Communities in relationship need interoperability. 

In the next section we describe how the OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) 
Encoding Standard and other OGC standards can be used to develop international 
domain-specific encoding standards that bring semantic standards and technical standards 
together. This is a key cyberinfrastructure innovation for environmental science, business 
and policymaking. A domain that develops a domain-specific data encoding standard 
based on OGC standards and on the domain's semantic standards gives domain 
participants much fuller access to developments in the mainstream digital technology 
world: Web searches, chained computer models, full use of cloud infrastructures, Big 
Data, data analytics, data fusion, management tools for open data, heterogeneous sensor 
webs and much more.

8. GML and SWE profiles and application schemas – Basis for domain-
specific environmental encoding standards 
Just as calculations like F=MA and e=mc2 require a unitary system59 of standard 
measurements of energy, matter, time and space, digital communications" involving 
environmental data require a unitary system of communicating not only measurements 
but also descriptions of where, how and when the measurements were made.  

The OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard60 (also an ISO 
standard since 2007) provides the essential "where" and "when" components. An 
international open standard that is now widely implemented, GML is an XML61 grammar 
for expressing geographical features. Fundamental OGC Web Service Interface Standards 
such as the OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) Interface Standard62 are specifically 
designed to write and read GML-encoded data. The WFS standard is implemented in 
virtually all commercial GIS products, and therefore GML is the "lingua franca" of those 
products. The use of GML reduces the need to use data transfer standards for batch 
conversion of data from one encoding to another as a first step in integrating differently 
encoded data sets.  Information systems that contain and process geospatial data in any 
encoding can be provided with interfaces that enable direct two-way inter-system 
communication via GML. Also, pared-down profiles and application schemas of GML 
are embedded in many non-OGC standards to assure consistent communication of 
geospatial data in the wider global information infrastructure. 

The OGC Observations and Measurements (O&M) Encoding Standard63 specifies an 
XML implementation of the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements (O&M) 
conceptual model. O&M provides a unitary system for encoding any type of observation 
or measurement, including volunteered geographic information (VGI), which may be 
anecdotal or photographic rather than the result of an instrument measurement.  

Both GML and O&M can be adapted to the particular needs of domains. They provide 
the means for domains to build their domain-consensus data models into an XML 
encoding that is recognized by any system that implements GML or O&M. The OGC 
WaterML 2.0 Encoding Standard, described below, provides a good example.  

Any GML or O&M data can be used directly with other GML or O&M data. For 
example, an agronomist could do analysis using a hydrology layer and a crop type layer. 
Or an emergency response coordinator could use WaterML-encoded river flow data to 
                                                
59 For most such calculations, British imperial, US customary or metric system units can be used, but 
consistent use of one or another is necessary! The alternative is frequent use of error-introducing unit 
conversions.

trigger a Common Alert Protocol (CAP)64 alert, because GML is embedded in CAP. 
Similarly, in the US the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM), an XML 
encoding for exchanging information across state and local government bodies, uses 
GML and is interoperable with GML-based standards such as WaterML 2.0. 

OGC coverages associate positions within a bounded space to feature attribute values. 
Examples include Earth images, referenced and non-referenced rasters, curvilinear grids, 
and point clouds. The OGC GML Coverages (GMLCOV) standard provides a unified 
method for encoding OGC coverages in GML, the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) 
Common Standard, and the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) Interface Standard. As 
GMLCOV is independent of a particular service definition, it allows coverage data to be 
exchanged through different types of services that implement these OGC standards. The 
OGC's modular, scalable coverage model provides a foundation for a wide variety of 
environmental "Big Data" applications. 

9. GEO and the GEOSS AIP 

The Group on Earth Observations (GEO)65 has helped establish a platform of cooperation 
among government data providers interested in sustainable development. GEO includes 
80 Governments, the European Commission and 58 intergovernmental, international, and 
regional Participating Organizations with a mandate in Earth observation or related 
issues. The ten years of GEO have yielded pledges of thousands of core datasets and web 
services. Progress has been made in encouraging interoperability across GEO through the 
adoption of standards by Members and Participating Organizations and the testing of 
infrastructure through a series of annual prototyping projects undertaken through the 
Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) Architecture Implementation 
Pilot (AIP)66 activity. The OGC leads the multi-year AIP activity using the OGC 
Interoperability Program policy and procedures. The AIP is now in its 7th year. 

The AIP task involves developing and deploying new process and infrastructure 
components for the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI) as well as for the broader 
GEOSS architecture. The GCI provides operational components that enable 1) the 
registration of EO assets to GEOSS, 2) the identification of adopted standards and best 
practices, and 3) the discovery and access of data via download, web services, and 
through custom portals and websites. 

The current AIP activity, AIP-7, aims to create and deploy several modern, lightweight 
web or mobile apps that are fed by multiple registered standards-based data and 
                                                
64 CAP 1.2 is an OASIS standard that grew out of an effort begun in 2001 by an international, independent 
group of over 120 emergency managers who began specifying and prototyping the Common Alerting 
Protocol data structure based on the recommendations of a US National Science and Technology Council 
(NSTC) report.

processing services - each app designed to address a specific user-driven problem. As 
with previous AIP activities, this year's (2015) AIP work is adding to the framework of 
standards described in previous sections of this paper. 

10. Examples of domain standards for the Age of the Environment 

10.1 WaterML 2.0 – hydrology 
Nations are moving towards more holistic structuring of hydrologic monitoring systems 
in order to provide integrated local, national and international views on the state of water 
resources. This is necessary to address issues such as water quality monitoring, flood 
warnings, water management guidelines (applying restrictions, setting allocations etc.), 
and drought management. In addition, terrestrial water movement plays a role in climate 
processes; cross-domain climatological enquiry and modelling requires access to diverse 
types of observational data, including hydrological observations.  

In response, key players in the international hydrology community came together in the 
OGC to develop an international hydrologic data encoding standard. The Australian 
Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO's Water for a Healthy Country Flagship project in 
Australia; the Consortium for the Advancement of Hydrological Sciences Inc. 
(CUAHSI), the San Diego Supercomputer Center, NOAA in the US; The Federal 
Waterways Engineering and Research Institute (disy Informationssysteme GmbH), the 
German Federal Institute of Hydrology and Kisters AG in Germany; the International 
Office for Water – Sandre in France; Deltares in the Netherlands and various other 
national authorities and companies contributed to initial working group discussions and 
also development and testing in OGC testbeds and pilots. The work proceeds under the 
joint World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and Open Geospatial Consortium 
(OGC) Hydrology Domain Working Group67. 

The OGC WaterML 2.0 Encoding Standard, now an adopted OGC standard, is the main 
product of this joint effort. WaterML2.0 is implemented as an application schema of the 
Geography Markup Language version 3.2.1 and it makes use of the OGC Observations & 
Measurements standard. The core aspect of the model is the correct, precise description 
of time series hydrologic observations. 

Hydrology data models are notoriously diverse, and yet most can be mapped to WaterML 
2.0. WaterML 2.0 thus provides a “data model Rosetta Stone” for data sharing between 
heterogeneous observation points and observation networks. A WaterML 2.0 compliant 
interface can be configured for a hydrological database that uses a unique data model. 
Access to similar data stored using two unique and dissimilar data models can proceed 
without manual intervention once the mapping between the two unique data models and 
the WaterML 2.0 data model has been completed. The internationally vetted data model

built into WaterML 2.0 also provides a model for optional improvement or harmonization 
of local, regional or national hydrological data models. 

WaterML 2.0 and the collaborative way it was developed provide a model for the 
development of other domain standards. 

10.2 WXXM – weather 
The aeronautical community depends heavily on WMO weather data, but this community 
has special requirements for the sharing and use of the data. A new standard, WXXM – 
Weather Information Exchange Model, has been developed by the International Civil 
Aviation Organisation ICAO, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and 
EUROCONTROL in collaboration with the WMO and the OGC for the exchange of 
aeronautical weather information in the context of a net-centric and global interoperable 
Air Transport System (ATS).  

WXXM uses GML tailored to the specific requirements of aeronautical meteorology. It is 
based also on the OGC Observation and Measurement Model (O&M). Because WXXM 
is a well-designed GML-based weather data encoding model, other domains, such as the 
electric utility information system domain68, are exploring options for using WXXM or 
harmonizing it with their standards, or else developing GML and O&M based weather 
models designed for their domains, in which most aviation use cases are irrelevant.  

10.3 netCDF – climate and oceans 
The network Common Data Form (netCDF) is a data model and a collection of access 
libraries for array-oriented scientific data. Originally developed by the University 
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), netCDF has been formally recognized 
by U.S. government standards bodies and has become a de facto standard used around the 
world, particularly in climate and ocean observation, analysis and modelling. For 
example, output datasets from climate models being used for the Fifth Assessment Report 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change must be submitted in netCDF format, 
using the associated Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions (CF-netCDF).  

The multi-dimensional gridded and multi-point data used in Fluid Earth Systems (FES) 
work (primarily involving oceans and the atmosphere) is complex and different from the 
2D images in Earth imaging and the 2D/3D data layers in GIS. NetCDF and its 
extensions provide an unprecedented degree of interoperability between complex FES 
data and coverage-based data and systems (e.g. satellite observations); feature-based data 
and systems (e.g. GIS layers); and specimen measurements (e.g. sensor observations).  

                                                
68 International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), US National Rural Electric Cooperative Association 
(NRECA), Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP). Another SDO whose remit requires weather 
information exchange is the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers 
(ASHRAE). ASHRAE SCP201P is a building/facility information model standard focused on loads; it 
includes a weather model based on WXXM. Weather forecast information may be needed, for example, at 
wind/solar generators located on buildings other facilities subject to ASHRAE standards.

This cross-technology interoperability is becoming increasingly important as FES 
observations and forecasts achieve higher spatial resolutions — just a few kilometers. 
The challenge is to enable practitioners in each technology realm to continue using the 
powerful tools available through their traditional applications while allowing for 
integration of data and applications between the two realms by means of standard, web-
based interfaces.  

10.4 GeoSciML – geology 
GeoSciML – Geoscience Markup Language – is a GML Application Schema used to 
support interoperability of geologic information provided by national Geologic Survey 
organizations and other geological data custodians. GeoSciML is useful for encoding the 
relatively simple "interpreted geology" information that is conventionally portrayed on 
geologic maps, but it can also be used to model more complex information types such as 
physical and chemical characteristics. Its feature-type catalogue includes geologic units, 
mapped features, geologic structures, as well as Earth materials (rocks and 
unconsolidated materials) and specializations of sampling features from the Observations 
and Measurements standard such as boreholes and geologic specimens. Supporting 
resources such as vocabularies for geoscience terminology and geologic timescales are 
developed in concert with the GML and O&M application schemas. 

The GeoSciML project was initiated in 2003 under the auspices of the International 
Union of Geoscientists (UGS) Commission for the Management and Application of 
Geoscience Information (CGI)69 working group on Data Model Collaboration - now the 
CGI Interoperability Working Group. The development of GeoSciML was strongly 
influenced by predecessor projects in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan. 

GeoSciML is intended to support data portals publishing data for customers, for 
interchanging data between organisations that use different data definitions, data models 
and even different languages and software/systems environments, and in particular, for 
use in geoscience web services. GeoSciML is currently used by national and international 
data sharing projects, including the OneGeology70 project, an effort to create a 
live geological map71 of the entire Earth by delivering data from many national 
geological surveys. It is also used as the geologic data transfer standard by the European 
Union INSPIRE Project72, the US Geoscience Information Network 73, and the Canadian 
Groundwater Information Network74.  

GeoSciML Version 3.1 was released in December 2012. In January 2013, a GeoSciML 
Standards Working Group was initiated in OGC, in collaboration with CGI, to develop a

version 4 release as an OGC modular specification. This release will include simple 
feature 'portrayal' schemes to support interoperable view services. Links to 
documentation, XML schema and other resources are available at the GeoSciML 
resource repository75. 

In a notable recent development, two geologists who have been instrumental in the 
development of GeoSciML, Simon Cox and Stephen Richard, have published "A 
geologic timescale ontology and service"76. This is an OWL (Web Ontology Language) 
ontology for the geologic timescale, derived from a Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
model. The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed 
to represent rich and complex knowledge about things and their relationships. Based on 
GeoSciML and other relevant standards, the geologic timescale ontology is an important 
exemplar for making data encoded using OGC domain standards discoverable and 
accessible to OWL queries.  OWL is part of the W3C’s Semantic Web technology stack. 
As the Web matures, the technologies of the Semantic Web will bring 
unprecedented reasoning power to computer programs. These technologies will help to 
verify the consistency of knowledge and help make implicit knowledge explicit.  

10.5 PipelineML SWG – pipeline management 
Pipelines are not natural resources, but OGC standards developed for energy, 
transportation, Smart Cities, emissions trading, urban modeling, indoor location, etc. 
belong to an important category of sustainable development standards for the 
Anthropocene, those that facilitate efficient management of natural resources and 
environmental impacts.  

An OGC PipelineML Standards Working Group (SWG) was chartered in June 2014 to 
develop an open extensible standard intended to enable the interchange of pipeline data 
between parties, disparate systems and software applications without loss of accuracy, 
density or data resolution and without need for conversion between intermediate or 
proprietary formats. The PODS Association77, a not-for-profit pipeline industry standards 
organization, initiated the discussions that led to the formation of the PipelineML SWG. 
They are using the OGC to develop a web services-based encoding standard that 
incorporates the experience and expertise represented in the current PODS standard and 
that is consistent with other geospatial data through its implementation of GML and 
O&M. 

Currently, pipeline operators must take in information in a wide variety of media and 
formats. Considerable effort and expense is incurred converting, transforming, and often 
massaging this data into a state in which the data is consumable by data management 
tools. Additionally, this conversion process tends to introduce errors and loss of density 
and resolution of data. A robust system for data exchange and service-oriented data 
discovery, assessment, access and use would enable pipeline operators and service

providers to dramatically reduce costs and shorten the time it takes to get critical 
information into the hands of decision-makers. Maintaining a higher degree of integrity, 
reliability, and accuracy of the data in an important anticipated benefit of the proposed 
PipelineML. The PODS data exchange format was an important step in that direction. 
Now PipelineML will bring PODS into the world of dynamic web service based data 
discovery, access, integration and use. 

Not directly related to the PipelineML activity, another OGC activity serving resource 
management in the oil and gas industry is the collaborative effort to develop an Oil Spill 
Response (OSR) Common Operating Picture (COP)78. It is anticipated that this will be 
advanced to the state of an OGC Best Practice. The OGC is working on this with the 
International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP)79 through the Geomatics 
Committee, IPIECA (the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and 
social issues)80 and Resource Data, Inc.81  

10.6 Other environmental domains in the OGC 
The OGC City Geography Markup Language (CityGML)82, a GML application schema, 
provides an open encoding for multiple levels of 3D detail about the built environment. 
CityGML "Application Domain Extensions" (ADEs) have been developed for modeling 
noise, tunnels, bridges, Building Information Models (buildingSMART International's 
Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs)83), water flow, utility networks, and immovable 
property taxation. It fills an important gap in urban spatial data infrastructures and is 
destined to play an important role in Smart Cities and sustainable development.  

The OGC IndoorGML standard84 is being developed to establish a common schema 
framework for indoor navigation applications.  IndoorGML, which will also be 
an application schema of GML, will use data encoded using CityGML and 
buildingSMART International's Industry Foundation Class (IFC) Building Information 
Model (BIM) standards.  

As of June 2014, new OGC working groups have been chartered or are being chartered to 
address interoperability issues in urban planning85, health86, agriculture87, and civil

engineering88. In addition, a recent memorandum of understanding between the OGC 
and the Electronic Commerce Code Management Association (ECCMA)89 has been 
announced that aims to establish a joint working group to develop and promote 
implementation of a new standard under the name ePROP - electronic Property 
standardization. That proposed standard is intended to be a valuable support for 
workflows involving real estate and related financial dealings. This standard for 
communicating characterizations real estate will play a role in environmental workflows. 

All of these new OGC working groups offer opportunities for universities, research 
organizations, professional organizations, businesses and government agencies to bring 
requirements and expertise to the task of developing standards that will be important in 
environmental activities related to each of these domains. All of these new domain 
standards will have implications for environmental research, business and policy. 

11. A call for a sustainable development IT standards research agenda 

In each of the domains described above, domain experts brought domain data modeling 
expertise into the OGC to create an international standard to benefit a particular 
information community. By doing this work in the OGC and by basing the new standards 
on the OGC GML, O&M and coverage standards, they have made it much easier for 
developers and users in their domains to integrate their data with other geospatial data 
and processing resources. 

Many other domains have yet to realize data encoding standards based on international 
data model coordination and international geospatial technical standards. The authors 
suggest a coordinated high-level analysis of what needs to be measured and 
communicated to enable collaborative and effective management of our interactions with 
Earth systems. The authors therefore call for a research agenda that focuses on 
identifying information types needed for sustainable development. Such an analysis will 
raise awareness, across all the environmental domains, of the need for and the path 
toward better communication of environmental data and better use of information 
technology in the service of sustainable development. 

12. A call for leadership 

The OGC and its many partner organizations encourage qualified and interested 
individuals, organizations, government agencies and businesses to join in global domain-
focused efforts to develop coordinated agendas for environmental standards research, 
development, implementation and use.

Key to success is visionary leadership. Experience with OGC working groups has shown 
the importance of visionary and committed individuals who decide to lead a standards 
effort. If one person in one OGC member organization can persuade member 
representatives from two other OGC members to join as co-initiators, a Domain Working 
Group or Standards Working Group can be formed. If their idea is sound, then papers, 
presentations, and outreach by OGC staff attract other organizations to the effort. The 
group's progress is reported out to the world, the group's issues are brought into testbeds, 
candidate standards are drafted, tested, vetted and approved, and soon the standard takes 
on a life of its own. The need for leadership remains, but after a time new business 
opportunities and policy imperatives drive participation, implementations and 
deployments forward.  

Every domain – weather, aviation, geology, etc. is different, with different associations, 
history, culture, market realities and so on. For domains that are not well organized and 
not accustomed to collaboration, progress is slower, but sometimes a major government 
agency or charitable foundation can fund participation by companies, universities and 
others to "prime the pump." Those who seize on the opportunity provided by institutional 
support quickly become recognized in their domains as leaders and visionaries. We live 
in an age that recognizes the value of networking and the value of those who build 
networks. 

We also live in an age when people are waking up to the importance of sustainable 
development.  The authors hope that this paper will encourage environmentally minded 
researchers, policy makers and business people to help develop the standards-based 
interoperability framework that enables the kind of communication they need to 
accomplish their missions in the Anthropocene era.
