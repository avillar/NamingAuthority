Preface 

This guide provides a resource to decision makers and technologists who are working to 
implement geoprocessing solutions within their organizations. Whether you are a 
procurement official working to procure geoprocessing technologies or a technology 
provider extending existing systems or developing new technology solutions, this guide 
will be an important resource.   

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture documents a “core” set of interoperability 
agreements that provide instructions for bridging the gaps between different organizations 
and communities that have heretofore shared geospatial information only with great 
difficulty. The portal addresses technical interoperability between diverse systems and it 
also helps address "information interoperability" between groups whose content has been 
created with different data models and metadata schemas.

Executive Summary 
The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture documents a “core” set of interoperability 
agreements that provide instructions for bridging the gaps between different organizations 
and communities that have heretofore shared geospatial information only with great 
difficulty.  The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture provides the basis for an open, 
vendor-neutral portal that is intended to be a first point of discovery for geospatial content 
in the context of designing and implementing the Spatial Data Infrastructures being 
developed by over 50 nations throughout the world.  In addition, the Geospatial Portal 
Reference Architecture has been developed in a manner that allows it to be aligned with 
other reference models and high level enterprise architectures.  

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is founded on the tenants of a Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA).  An SOA is an architecture that represents software 
functionality as discoverable services on a network yielding the following benefits:  

• Easier extension of legacy logic to work with new business functionality  

• Greater flexibility to change without the need to constantly re-architect for growth  

• Cost savings by providing straight-forward integration. 

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture specifies four service classes that are needed 
to procure a comprehensive geospatial portal implementation and it identifies the OpenGIS 
Interoperability Standards that are applicable to the services.  The four service classes are:  

• Portal Services –Provide the single point access to the geospatial information on 
the portal.  In addition, these services provide the management and administration 
of the portal. 

• Catalog Services –Used to locate geospatial services and information wherever it 
is located and provide information on the services and information if finds to the 
user. 

• Portrayal Services –Used to process the geospatial information and prepare it for 
presentation to the user. 

• Data Services – Used to provide geospatial content and data processing.  

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is a major step forward for E-Government, 
National Spatial Data Infrastructures, enterprises and Information Communities. It enables 
geoprocessing interoperability that make it possible to exchange heterogeneous geographic 
information content and share a wide variety of geospatial services over the World Wide 
Web.

1 Introduction 
A portal is a website that acts as gateway providing a single access point to multiple 
resources. It is a web environment that allows an organization or a community of 
information users and providers to aggregate and share content. It is an organized 
collection of links to other sites.  A portal may be secure and it may be personalized. A 
geospatial portal is a human interface to a collection of online geospatial information 
resources, including data sets and services.   

Around the world, over 50 nations are developing Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). These 
national activities are supported by regional collaborative efforts in Asia and the Pacific, 
Europe, the Americas and Africa and in an emerging Global Spatial Data Infrastructure 
(GSDI) effort. While there are many differences in economic, social and legal frameworks 
around the world, the GSDI is being fueled by widespread agreement on common 
approaches in many fundamental Spatial Data Infrastructure development and 
implementation practices.  

Through the coordination efforts of the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Steering 
Committee (now the GSDI Association), the GSDI is taking on a clear form and substance. 
It consists of standardized Geospatial Metadata, a Network of Spatial Data Clearinghouses 
operating on common standards-based protocols, and an emerging agreement on a set of 
core data sets that will be globally available to serve as base content for SDI linkage, for 
common use in spatial data applications, and for further attribution and densification for 
larger scale use. The GSDI includes OpenGIS Standards as a key enabler of 
interoperability between geoprocessing systems. 

The philosophy and work of the various nation SDI efforts as well as the GSDI Association 
are clearly in line with the Declaration of Principals from the World Summit on the 
Information Society was hosted in Geneva by the Government of Switzerland from 10 to 
12 December 2003. The Declaration of Principles WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/0004 
concluded in paragraph 44: 

Standardization is one of the essential building blocks of the Information Society. 
There should be particular emphasis on the development and adoption of international 
standards. The development and use of open, interoperable, non-discriminatory and 
demand-driven standards that take into account needs of users and consumers is a 
basic element for the development and greater diffusion of ICTs and more affordable 
access to them, particularly in developing countries. International standards aim to 
create an environment where consumers can access services worldwide regardless of 
underlying technology.  

This document defines the Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture that provides the basis 
for an open, vendor-neutral portal that is intended to be a first point of discovery for 

http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/md/03/wsis/doc/S03-WSIS-DOC-0004!!MSW-E.doc


geospatial content in the context of designing and implementing an SDI.  The reference 
architecture described in this document is a general architectural framework for standards-
based geospatial portals that provide open Web access to geospatial content and online 
geoprocessing services from diverse public and private sector sources. Such portals can be 
built from interoperating products supplied by vendors whose products use interfaces, 
protocols, schemas, and encodings that implement OGC's OpenGIS Standards.1  The 
essential requirement is that it must be "as open as the Web," open to as many other Web-
based geospatial resources as possible, through interfaces, encodings and schemas that 
conform to OpenGIS Specifications.

2 Geospatial Portal Overview  

2.1 Geospatial Portal Description 

The overall goal for Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is to make it easier, faster, 
and less expensive for any organization wishing to implement a standards based 
geospatially enabled portal application. A primary objective of the reference architecture is 
to define the requirements of an architectural framework that can be used as a guide to the 
implementation of an operational portal that provides access to geospatial content, maps, 
and metadata. This reference architecture specifies the scope, objectives and behavior of a 
portal and identifies its functional components. In addition to identifying the general 
requirement of an effective geospatial portal, this document highlights how OpenGIS 
Standards explicitly support the capabilities of the reference architecture.  

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is shown in Figure 1.  The reference 
architecture contains five different classes of services that support the requirements of a 
geospatial portal. 

 

Figure 1. The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture 

A brief description of these service classes is presented here with more detailed 
descriptions provided in section 3 of this documents: 

• Portal Services –Provide the single point access to the geospatial information on 
the portal.  In addition, these services provide the management and administration 
of the portal.

• Catalog Services –Used to locate geospatial services and information wherever it 
is located and provide information on the services and information if finds to the 
user. 

• Portrayal Services –Used to process the geospatial information and prepare it for 
presentation to the user. 

• Data Services – Used to provide geospatial content and data processing.  

It is important to understand that the Portal Services and any required Infrastructure 
Services are the only ones that need be resident on the platform on which the portal is 
operating.  All of the other services can be distributed across the Internet and can be 
dynamically registered and executed.  Also notice that the Portal does not store the 
geospatial data processed by the distributed services.  This loosely coupled service 
orientation is known as a service oriented architecture, which is described in more  detail 
subsequence section.  

2.2 Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)2 
Service orientation is a way of viewing software assets on the network—fundamentally, 
the perspective of IT functionality being available as discoverable Services on the network. 
Essentially, Service orientation provides business users with understandable, high-level 
business Services they can call upon and incorporate into business processes as needed. 
The Service orientation vision is therefore one of agility and flexibility for users of 
technology, coupled with an abstraction layer that hides the complexity of today’s 
heterogeneous IT environments from those users. 
 
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)  is an architecture that represents software 
functionality as discoverable Services on the network. SOAs have been around for many 
years, but the difference with the SOAs we talk about today is that they are based on 
standards, in particular, Web Services. Web Services provide standards-based interfaces to 
software functionality. Producers of these Services may publish information about them in 
a Service registry, where Service consumers can then look up the Services they need and 
retrieve the information about those Services they need to bind to them. 
 

Applications designed using SOA can provide the same functionality as that found in a 
monolithic architecture coupled with the following additional benefits:  

• Easier extension of legacy logic to work with new business functionality  

• Greater flexibility to change without the need to constantly re-architect for growth  

• Cost savings by providing straight-forward integration

oriented architecture Software is an excellent reference on SOA.

Within the SOA context, therefore, the Portal is the ideal mechanism for realizing the Web 
Services vision of “enter once, use often” by providing a bridge between “separate islands 
of data and processing services.” The portal does not store any content. Therefore, the 
geospatial content and services remain with the responsible authority- those agencies or 
private sector organizations responsible for the collecting and maintaining geospatial 
content continue to retain control of those activities. The authoritative source for geospatial 
content and services becomes the Portal as the conduit to disparate and distributed content 
and services.  The OGC reference architecture is a service-oriented architecture based on 
the now recognized Web Services paradigm of the publish/find/bind pattern and supports 
the dynamic binding between service/content providers and requestors since sites and 
applications are frequently changing in a distributed environment. Content and service 
providers publish their availability to the portal’s catalog making their information 
“known” to the portal.  

2.2.1 Publish-Find-Bind  

The core method of communications within the portal is based on service-oriented 
architecture that follows a service trading paradigm.  Service trading is a fundamental 
concept that addresses the discovery of available service instances.  Publishing a capability 
or offering a service is called “export” (publish). Finding a service request against 
published offers or discovering services is called “import” (Find). Binding a client to a 
discovered service is called “service interaction” (Bind).  This can also be depicted in an 
equivalent manner as the “Publish – Find – Bind” (PFB) pattern of service interaction. 
These fundamental roles and interactions are depicted in Figure 2. 

This service trading function is elaborated in a separate document (ISO/IEC 13235-1) and 
refined somewhat in the Object Management Group (OMG) Trading specification, which 
is technically aligned with the computational view of the ODP trading function. Most 
importantly, a broker supports dynamic (i.e. run-time) binding between service providers 
and requesters, since sites and applications are frequently changing in large distributed 
systems.  A broker registers service offers from provider objects and returns service offers 
upon request to requestor objects according to some criteria.

Figure 2. Service Trading Communication Structure 

In the portal reference architecture, there are three fundamental roles that are defined to 
actuate the service trading.  They are: 

Broker - a role that registers service offers from service providers and returns service 
offers upon request to requestor according to some criteria. 

Provider - a role that registers service offers with a broker and provides services to clients. 

Requestor - a role that obtains service offers, satisfying some criteria, from the broker and 
binds to discovered services provided by the provider. 

To export (i.e. publish a service offer), an object gives the broker a description of a service, 
including a description of the interface at which that service instance is available. To 
import (i.e. find suitable service offers), an object asks the broker for a service having 
certain characteristics. The broker checks against the descriptions of services and responds 
to the requestor with the information required to bind with a service instance. Preferences 
may be applied to the set of offers matched according to service type, some constraint 
expression, and various policies. Application of the preferences can determine the order 
used to return matched offers to the requestor. 

 

2.2.2 Self-Describing Services 

In order for a service oriented architecture to operate in an effective and efficient manner, 
the services must be self describing.  That is, each service must provide a machine readable 
description of its location and capabilities.  This self describing information is what is 
registered to the portal catalogs and enables the services to be dynamically invoked with no 
modification needed to the portal software.  The description of the self describing services 

6 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved

 



is usually based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML).  An example of a standard 
that uses XML for describing a service is WSDL (Web Services Description Language). 
Expressed in XML, a WSDL definition describes how to access a web service and what 
operations it will perform. 

2.3 Alignment with other Reference Architectures 

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture has been developed in a generic enough 
manner that allows it to be aligned with other reference models and high level enterprise 
architectures.  Several examples are discussed in the subsequent sections. 

2.3.1 OpenGIS Reference Model 

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture follows the tenants set forth in the OpenGIS 
Reference Model (ORM)3.  The ORM documents a framework of interoperability for 
geospatial processing ranging from tightly coupled, real time systems on a single CPU to 
the "Spatial Web" -- the open environment that enables barrier-free communication of 
geographic information among users of the World Wide Web. The ORM provides the 
overall conceptual framework for building geospatial processing into distributed systems in 
an incremental and interoperable manner.  The ORM is a living document and is updated 
periodically as OGC membership continues to advance geoprocessing interoperability.    

2.3.2 Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)4 

To facilitate efforts to transform the Federal Government into one that is citizen-centered, 
results-oriented, and market-based, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is 
developing the FEA, a business-based framework for Government-wide improvement. The 
FEA is being constructed through a collection of interrelated reference models designed to 
facilitate cross-agency analysis and the identification of gaps, duplicative investments, and 
opportunities for collaboration within and across Federal Agencies, addressing key areas 
such as: 

• Budget Allocation; 

• Horizontal and Vertical Information Sharing; 

• Performance Measurement; 

• Budget / Performance Integration; 

• Cross-Agency Collaboration; 

• E-Government;  

• Component-Based Architectures.

2.3.3 Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe 

INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe) is a European initiative aimed 
at making geospatial content more readily available and useful for sustainable development 
and increased protection of the environment. It is to be implemented throughout the 
European Union (EU) over the next few years with different types of geographical 
information gradually harmonized and integrated, leading to a European Spatial Data 
Infrastructure (ESDI). The ESDI will deliver to users integrated spatial information 
services, which cannot practically be integrated except through the standards referenced in 
the Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture. 

2.3.4 European Public Sector Information Network (ePSINet) 

ePSINet aims to help the adoption of beneficial regulatory, standards, and information 
management frameworks for Public Sector Information by providing structured access for 
stakeholders in this area to: 

• Policy and legislation information linked to legal cases;  

• Innovation and good practice in the management of PSI over the whole information 
lifecycle, covering back office, workflow, content and records management, 
preservation, search technologies, multilingual applications and delivery channels 
such as web portals, Digital TV, mobile devices and kiosks;  

• Developments in the related standards, especially those needed to ensure wide, 
cross-domain interoperability including those related to data formats, metadata, 
identifiers, terminologies, preservation, rights management, multilingual 
applications and the emerging standards for the semantic web.  

2.3.5 European Information Architecture for Public Administration 

The InfoCitizen European Information Architecture for Public Administration is the 
conceptual basis for the InfoCitizen system and its components. It contains the necessary 
models and descriptions that have been developed in order to fulfill the requirements 
analyzed in WP1 and that meet the goal of developing an interoperable system integrating 
business processes in European Public Administrations. 

The InfoCitizen European Architecture is divided into three parts: 

• The conceptual part, defining the business processes, information objects and the 
basic interoperability mechanisms (InfoCitizen Conceptual Architecture). 

• The technical description, defining the structure of the InfoCitizen Platform, its 
various components that compose the platform as well as the interrelationships 
amongst them (InfoCitizen Technical Architecture). 

• The system description, detailing the software-technical consequences and 
limitations exposed by the overall architecture. Also, there will be a focus on the 
low level details that include the Standards Profile and the Security Profile 
(InfoCitizen System Architecture).

3 Geospatial Portal Service Requirements 
The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture describes a framework within which an 
organized collection of open standard specifications can be implemented to create spatial 
content and vendor neutral "plug and play" portal infrastructures. The Geospatial Portal 
Reference Architecture is also a guide for the development of affordable Web sites that 
make geospatial content and geoprocessing services easily discoverable and usable and 
easily integrated into larger enterprise workflows and information systems. It is explicitly 
open, vendor-neutral, and not dependent on any particular geographic information system 
(GIS), programming language, database, middleware or operating system. Components of 
portals based on the Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture – servers, clients, servlets, 
applets, middleware, databases, applications, etc. – and the external resources that link to 
them can be commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), government-off-the-shelf (GOTS), custom, 
shareware, open source, and/or legacy. These components communicate through the 
standard interfaces, protocols and schemas defined in the Geospatial Portal Reference 
Architecture. 

 

Figure 3. Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture Services Distribution. 

In Figure 3, the Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is presented again this time 
identifying the particular services that fall within each class of service.  In the subsequent 
section, each of the services is discussed along with identifying which OGC 
Implementation Specification is applicable for that service.

3.1 Portal services 

The Portal Services are accessible from the Portal Platform (e.g. desktop, laptop, etc.) or 
servers that have network connectivity. Users may leverage Portal Services to access the 
distributed Portrayal, Catalog and Data services, depending upon the requirements and 
designed implementation of the application. The access to these services is provided by 
client software that is resident on the portal platform. More specifically, when accessed as 
a World Wide Web application a Client runs on an HTTP server and generates HTML 
pages to be displayed in the User's web browser (the thin client).  

3.1.1 Viewer Client  

The Viewer Client provides a visualization user interface to display and navigate content 
retrieved from the Portrayal and Data services.  

3.1.2 Discovery Client  

The Discovery Client provides means for users to locate needed content and services 
according to user-defined criteria. More specifically, the Discovery Client enables the 
portal catalog containing the information about the content and services tat have been 
registered to the portal to be searched and the request displayed to the user.   The 
Discovery Client will also allow the user to select a desired content or service and have the 
service invoked for presentation in the viewer client. 

3.1.3 Publisher Client  

The Publisher Client provides means for portal maintainers and authorized users to publish 
services or content discovered using the portal catalog. The Publisher Client allows 
authorized users to register primary information sources, pre-defined symbolization rules, 
and possibly other information. This published information is then made available to the 
Discovery Client where the published information can be found and services invoked. 

3.1.4 Gazetteer Client  

The Gazetteer Client provides users the ability to navigate through spatially organized 
features with well-known feature names. Gazetteer Clients allow users to formulate queries 
to retrieve named features. The Gazetteer Client should utilize the USGS Geographic 
Names Information System as a primary database of feature names. 

3.1.5 Data Extraction Client  

Data Extraction Clients provide users the ability to extract specific content from the Data 
Services class of services.  

3.1.6 Data Manipulation Client  

Data Manipulation Clients provide users the ability to access, modify, add, and delete 
geospatial content stored at remote Data Services providers.  

3.1.7 Symbol/Style Management Client  

Symbol/Style Management clients allow users to browse the styles available from a given 
server and obtain and apply a predefined style definition for a particular feature type(s).

3.1.8 Authentication and Access Control 

The Portal may enable Authentication and Access Control that restricts access to an 
organization’s content and service offerings based on criteria that are controlled locally and 
documented in the Portal site as a set of rules. At a minimum, the portal should  not 
prohibit Providers from defining access restrictions. In other words, the portal must not 
cause all Users to appear as a single anonymous user when invoking services through the 
portal. 

Providers may enforce access restrictions at the network TCP/IP level, at the HTTP server 
level, at the web service component level, or at any other point of the service request's 
passage through the Provider's network. Providers should not be required to register their 
access restrictions at the portal; however, service metadata and dataset metadata should 
include information about restrictions to minimize failed access requests.  Portal 
participants may select and document appropriate metadata fields for this purpose. 

3.1.9 Exposed Services 

In addition to the client Portal client access discussed above, the Portal can also be a 
service provider unto itself by furnishing Exposed Services to users, customers and client 
software that is external to the portal.  Basically, the Portal can be constructed to take 
advantage of the access that the portal has to the content and services that have been 
registered to the Portal and expose services of its own,  These services can be a reflection 
of the registered services, where the Portal acts as a single proxy to the many registered 
services, or the Portal can offer up services that have been specifically constructed to meet 
some special needs of the organization hosting the Portal.  

3.2 Application Integration Framework 

One of the key overall goals of the Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is that an 
instance of the reference architecture will create an Application Integration Framework 
(AIF).  This AIF will provide an operational environment that will have the ability to 
dynamically integrate an ever expanding set of geospatial content and services into the 
Portal.  This capability is accomplished with the cataloging of geospatial content and 
services that can be discovered by the users and dynamically evoked using tools that are 
compliant with the OpenGIS Standards that enable geospatial information interoperability.   

The AIF includes an integrated infrastructure to maintain and pass parameters between 
OGC compliant components, as well as a client-side web-based presentation framework for 
the Portal. The AIF communicates with other portal components through well-defined 
software interfaces, such that different instances of such modular components could be 
substituted. The AIF is able to construct valid requests to service provider such as WMS, 
WFS and WCS instances to be executed either by the portal or by the user.  

3.3 Portrayal Services 

Portrayal Services provide specialized capabilities supporting visualization of geospatial 
information. Portrayal Services are components that, given one or more inputs, produce 
rendered outputs (e.g., cartographically portrayed maps, perspective views of terrain, 

11 © OGC 2004 – All rights reserved

 



annotated images, views of dynamically changing features in space and time, etc.) 
Portrayal Services can be tightly or loosely coupled with other services such as Data and 
Processing Services and transform, combine, or create portrayed outputs. Portrayal 
Services may use styling rules specified during configuration or dynamically at runtime by 
Application Services. 

Portrayal Services provide specialized capabilities supporting visualization of geospatial 
information. Portrayal Services are components that, given one or more inputs, produce 
rendered outputs (e.g., cartographically portrayed maps) or leverage the parameters of 
rendered outputs to coordinate multi-source display (e.g. create scale and view-dependent 
displays).  Portrayal Services are loosely coupled with other services such as Map and Data 
Services and transform, combine, or create portrayed outputs. Five possible components as 
identified with the OGC Reference Architecture are described below. 

3.3.1 Map Portrayal 

The OpenGIS Web Map Server Specification5 (WMS) is a set of protocols that provide 
access by Web clients to maps rendered by map servers on the Internet. The WMS 
interface allows the client to query the “capabilities” of a given map server. Based on the 
capabilities, the WMS interface allows a server to return a Portable Network Graphics 
(PNG), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Joint Photographic Expert Group format 
(JPEG), or Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image for a given area of interest and a 
specified coordinate reference system. These returned images (pictures) can be viewed in 
transparency mode, thus allowing for example, the display of roads on top of a satellite 
image. The WMS interface support user queries of displayed spatial content that indicates 
the Spatial Reference System (SRS) and Bounding Box of the portion of the Earth to be 
mapped, and the output width, height and format of the picture.  The WMS can have an 
addition capability to define styles that control the presentational rules that are to be used 
when displaying geographic features.  This ability to control the display styles in defined in 
the Styled Layer Descriptors Specification6 (SLD).  

3.3.2 Cascading Map Reference 

The Cascading Map Server is a special case of the WMS in that it does not hold any 
content of its own; rather, it serves as a gateway for other data providers, both OGC-
compliant and not. Cascading Map Servers incorporate clients for a number of services. 
These clients, however, do not have to be just for OpenGIS interfaces. Legacy data 
providers can be accessed, their content retrieved, adjusted, and re-presented through the 
OpenGIS® Web Mapping Service interface. As such, the Cascading Map Server can serve 
a key role in presenting legacy data that may otherwise be inaccessible.  

This service communicates with Provider WMS instances (both basic and SLD-enabled) to 
formulate and possibly execute valid operations to request service metadata, to request 
maps, or to perform other operations available from the Provider. The Cascading WMS 
component can transform map formats and map projections. It allows users to discover and

select appropriate styles (either named or SLD-based) for each map layer and composes the 
SLDs so that map portrayal can be requested. 

3.3.3 Symbol/Style Management Service 

The Symbol/Style Management Service is a multi-component system that enables map and 
content retrieval, and includes the capability for creating, storing, and/or retrieving styles 
and symbols from multiple communities or user groups and combining all these elements 
of information into an appropriately symbolized map. This service may consist of multiple 
components including a Style Registry, Style Repository, Symbol Registry, and Symbol 
Repository presented through a common, standard interface.  A formal description of the 
Symbol/Style Management Service is currently in the change proposal process with the 
OGC Specification Program as a modification to the Styled Layer Descriptors 
Specification. 

3.3.4 Map Context Encoding 

The OpenGIS Web Map Context Specification7 allows users to save complex multi-source 
presentations so they can be retrieved in total in the future so they do not have to be rebuilt 
from scratch. It is useful to be able to record the state of a WMS client application at a 
view of interest to a user, and then to restore that state at a later time.  

3.3.5 Coverage Portrayal 

The Coverage Portrayal Service (CPS) (a discussion paper, not yet an adopted OpenGIS 
Specification) enables users to produce visual pictures from coverage data (such as digital 
elevation data or Earth image data).  The CPS works much like a WMS instance, but 
includes additional parameters to control the retrieval and/or rendering of coverage data.  

3.4 Catalogue Services 

Catalog Services provide a common mechanism to classify, register, describe, search, 
maintain and access information about resources available on a network. Resources are 
network addressable instances of typed data or services. Types of registries are 
differentiated by their role such as registries for cataloging data types (e.g., types of 
geographic features, coverages, sensors, and symbols), online data instances (e.g., datasets, 
repositories, and symbol libraries), service types and online service instances. Catalog 
services allow:  

1) Providers of resources to publish descriptive information about resource types and 
instances; 

2) Requestors of resources to discover information about resource types and instances; 
and  

3) Requestors of resources to access (bind to) resource providers.

https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=3841


Catalogue services support the ability to publish and search collections of descriptive 
information (metadata) for data, services, and related information objects. Metadata in 
catalogues represent resource characteristics that can be queried and presented for 
evaluation and further processing by both humans and software. Catalogue services are 
required to support the discovery and binding to registered information resources within an 
information community.  

The OpenGIS® catalog document specifies the interfaces, bindings, and a framework for 
defining application profiles required to publish and access digital catalogues of metadata 
for geospatial content, services, and related resource information. Metadata act as 
generalized properties that can be queried and returned through catalogue services for 
resource evaluation and, in many cases, invocation or retrieval of the referenced resource. 
Catalogue services support the use of one of several identified query languages to find and 
return results using well-known content models (metadata schemas) and encodings. This 
OpenGIS® document is applicable to the implementation of interfaces on catalogues of a 
variety of information resources.  

3.5 Data Services 

Data Services provide access to collections of content in repositories and databases. 
Resources accessible by Data Services can generally be referenced by a name (identity, 
address, etc). Given a name, Data Services can then find the resource. Data Services 
usually maintain indexes to help speed up the process of finding items by name or by other 
attributes of the item. The OpenGIS Framework defines common encodings and interfaces 
in which multiple, distributed Data Services are accessed and their contents “exposed” in a 
consistent manner to other major components. The sections below describe the current set 
of Data Services of the OpenGIS Framework.  

3.5.1 Feature Services 

The OpenGIS Web Feature Service Specification8 (WFS) supports the query and discovery 
of geographic features and attributes. In a typical Web-base scenario, WFS delivers 
Geography Markup Language9 (GML) representations of simple geospatial features in 
response to queries from HTTP clients. Clients (service requestors) access geographic 
feature data through a WFS by submitting a request for just those features that are needed 
for an application. The client generates a request posts it to a WFS instance (a WFS server 
on the Web). The WFS instance executes the request, returning the results to the client as 
GML. A GML-enabled client can manipulate or operate on the returned features.  

3.5.2 Symbology Management  

This service is a multi-component system that enables map and content retrieval, and 
includes the capability for creating, storing, and/or retrieving styles and symbols from 
multiple communities or user groups and combining all these elements of information into

an appropriately symbolized map. This service may consist of multiple components 
including a Style Registry, Style Repository, Symbol Registry, and Symbol Repository 
presented through a common, standard interface. 

3.5.3 Gazetteer 

A Gazetteer is a directory of features containing some information regarding position. A 
Gazetteer Service is a network-accessible service that retrieves one or more features (after 
the ISO feature model), given a query (filter) request. This filter request must support 
selection by well-known feature attribute values, and especially by published or context-
unique identifiers.. The queryable feature attributes are any properties that describe the 
features, including but not limited to feature type, feature name, authority, or identification 
code. Each instance of a Gazetteer Service has an associated vocabulary of identifiers. 
Thus, a Gazetteer Service may apply to a given region, such as a country, or some other 
specialized grouping of features. The returned features will include one or more geometries 
expressed in an OGC Spatial Reference System. This Gazetteer interface extends the WFS 
specification by defining additional behavior and formalizing the response schema 
elements.  The Gazetteer is service is described in the OGC discussion paper “Gazetteer 
Service Profile of a WFS10”. 
3.5.4 Coverage Services 

The OpenGIS Web Coverage Service Specification11 (WCS) supports the networked 
interchange of geospatial content as "coverages" containing values or properties of 
geographic locations. Unlike the Web Map Service, which filters and portrays spatial 
content to return static maps (server-rendered as pictures), the Web Coverage Service 
provides access to intact (unrendered) geospatial information, as needed for client-side 
rendering, multi-valued coverages, and input into scientific models and other clients 
beyond simple viewers. 

3.6 Procurement Issues 

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture represents a big step forward for 
procurement officials seeking to satisfy their agencies' spatial information requirements at 
the lowest possible cost, and with the greatest adherence to laws and policies regarding 
standards and interoperability. 

A portal based on interoperable components using standard interfaces and protocols is 
highly flexible and "agile". As requirements or technology change, as market demand 
grows, as new functions must be added, a standards based portal can be cost effectively 
and quickly enhanced. As new standards and specifications are approved in OGC and 
implemented in products, new services and content sources can be effectively integrated 
into the Portal infrastructure.

Existing content producers can usually extend their systems with open interfaces to become 
part of geospatial information networks with open portals. Most providers of GIS, Earth 
imaging, facilities management, automated mapping, decision support, navigation and 
location based services software are implementing these open interfaces on their servers 
and clients.  Agencies employing the component-based Geospatial Portal Reference 
Architecture reduce their risk of "vendor lock in," save money through a buy-as-you-go 
approach, and maximize their compatibility with other resources in their networks.  

Rapid build-out of the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) depends on agencies 
purchasing products with interfaces that implement OpenGIS Specifications. You can't 
have a network if the nodes don't interoperate. If they interoperate, it doesn't matter which 
vendor provided the software – You can pick the best and/or least expensive. Different 
vendors have different strengths and different users have different needs, which is why 
agency-wide single vendor mandates seldom hold up over time.  

OGC programs reduce technology risk by providing an alternative to "putting all your eggs 
in one basket". When the market offers a new component that is better than a similar 
component being used by an old component, the old component can be quickly and 
inexpensively replaced. Such upgrades are much smaller and more future-compatible when 
a non-proprietary framework connects the parts. Governments are seeking procurement 
reform. By participating in OGC programs, agencies enhance the market's ability to meet 
future procurement needs with standards-based solutions. Two or ten or twenty competing 
vendors produce far more options than one vendor contracted to incrementally enhance its 
own proprietary systems. All Spatial Data Infrastructure initiatives worldwide are moving 
rapidly and inexorably toward interoperability based on open standards, not 
interoperability based on one vendor's proprietary architecture.  

Governments seeking procurement reform establish policies to support information 
technology standards, including standards for interconnectivity and interoperability. 
Interconnectivity and interoperability depend on vendor-neutral standards such as TCP/IP, 
HTML, SQL and XML. To achieve interoperability in GIS, agencies need to purchase 
software with interoperability interfaces that implement the vendor-neutral OpenGIS® 
Specifications coming from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Most of these 
specifications get put on track to become ISO/TC 211 standards, and they are endorsed by 
the Federal Geographic Data Committee and by a growing number of spatial data agencies 
in other countries. OGC is working in a joint coordination effort with ISO TC/211 
(Geomatics) as to ensure that market-derived approaches mesh with the global de jure 
standards program. This is important for agencies because they need assurance that their 
strategies to modernize and stay efficient will be durable and part of the mainstream of 
technology development.

4 Summary 

The  standards-based, vendor-neutral Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture  
• Describes how to build standards-based portals for easy publishing and use of geodata 

and services, 

• Shows procurement officials how to acquire geoprocessing software that "plugs and 
plays" in government enterprise information systems, 

• Makes it easy to add geospatial capabilities to otherwise non-spatial federal, state and 
local E-Government portals, and portals belonging to businesses, organizations and 
communities,  

• Shows how existing GIS's and other geoprocessing systems can be made interoperable 
through implementation of OpenGIS standards. 

The Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture is a major step forward for E-Government, 
National Spatial Data Infrastructures, enterprises and Information Communities. It is made 
possible by recent advances in industry consensus on geoprocessing interoperability 
interfaces that make it possible to network heterogeneous geographic information systems 
and systems for digital cartography, facilities management, Earth imaging, navigation and 
location based services. Prior to this time, diverse proprietary data formats and processing 
approaches made it very difficult to share digital geospatial content. Now geospatial 
content is part of what can be accessed and used on the Web. The Web – and government 
enterprise information systems – have been spatially enabled. The Geospatial Portal 
Reference Architecture represents the most recent step, and a very important step, in this 
extremely valuable progress.
