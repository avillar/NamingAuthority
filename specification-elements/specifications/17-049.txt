i. Abstract 

This paper is intended to identify usability issues associated with use of OGC web 
mapping services that affect the quality of experience a user may have when accessing 
and using OGC web services and discuss potential solutions and guidance to address 
these issues. Additionally, guidance on evaluating and self-assessing the Quality of 
Experience of Spatial Data Services will also be discussed and addressed with a proposal 
for common assessment criteria and common practices for improving the user experience 
when viewing, layering or querying OGC web mapping services. 
 

ii. Keywords 

The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

ogcdoc, OGC document, quality, web services, best practices. 

iii. Background 

The notion of a Quality of Service activity was initially raised in the Opening Plenary of 
the June 2016 Technical Committee (TC) / Planning Committee (PC) meeting in Dublin, 
Ireland. A survey was released shortly thereafter to canvass OGC members on 
expectations for the proposed activity; eight ad-hoc meetings of the group convened 
between July and December of 2016, culminating in a draft Charter for a Quality of 
Service Experience Domain Working Group, which was approved by the OGC TC/PC at 
the Taichung Meetings in December 2016. 

During the development of the Charter, the scope of the QoSE DWG evolved to include 
considerations of the usability of web mapping services and the quality of the end-user 
experience. While no standards-setting activity is anticipated to result from discussion of 
Quality of Experience, it is expected that a Best Practices document supporting all 
conditions to ensure a positive and fruitful experience when creating and using OGC web 
mapping services will result.  

The assessment framework, evaluation criteria and best practices suggested in this 
discussion paper are the result of a web mapping service quality study based on an 
inventory of Government of Canada web map services available via the Canadian Federal 
Geospatial Platform. Natural Resources Canada worked with Refractions Research to 
construct an assessment framework and used it to assess the quality of 160 OGC and Esri 
REST web mapping services. The results of the assessment clearly showed that the 
quality and usability of web mapping services is strongly dependent on a number of 
relatively simple, straightforward considerations, such as: 

• Use of meaningful, jargon-free naming for titles, layers and attributes; 
• A clear, readable and easy to understand legend;

• An appealing cartographic representation that is easy to interpret; 
• Adequately detailed metadata; and 
• Inclusion of relevant and easy to understand data dictionaries and other 

supporting documentation. 

 These relatively simple considerations are often overlooked when constructing web 
services.

1. Scope 

This paper explores means of ensuring that persons using OGC web mapping services 
consistently experience and achieve a meaningful interaction between themselves, any 
web services being accessed, and the data those services represent.  

Organizations that provide open web mapping services generally do so with the intent of 
allowing end users to view one or more datasets as a map in any OGC-compliant web 
mapping client or application. OGC web services are open and interoperable by design, 
are normative and can be tested for full compliance according to its OCG specification. 
Standing up an OGC web mapping service involves following the specification and 
results is an open, interoperable service that makes it possible to visualize geospatial data 
as a map.

In theory, this approach sounds simple. In practice, challenges abound. The Quality of 
Service Experience Domain Working Group (QoSE DWG) has found that a reasonable 
quality of experience (QoE) for the end user when using OGC-OWS is not always 
assured. Web mapping services can comply perfectly with the OGC specification and still 
be perceived by the user as confusing, difficult to use, poorly documented or poorly 
presented. Through interaction and support of its end users, the Federal Geospatial 
Platform has found that geospatial web services are not always easy or intuitive to 
navigate, combine or understand, especially for light or moderate users1. Ongoing user 
testing has shown that OGC web mapping services can leave many end users unable to 
fully understand or make use of results. A light user that cannot interpret or make sense 
of information presented by a web service will not feel confident in using that 
information to help build a policy position or make a decision and are likely to seek other 
sources of information to inform their decisions. This lack of usability for many users 
seriously weakens the business case for provision of OGC web services.  

A study of the usability of web mapping services by the Canada Centre for Mapping and 
Earth Observation and Refractions Research in 2016 suggested that an optimal end user 
experience with OGC web mapping services is in part hindered by a current lack of 
documented good practices to guide web service providers when creating OGC web 
services. The QoSE DWG has taken on the task of providing documented good practices 
and guidance for providers of web services to fill this gap.  

This discussion paper is the first step in identifying quality and usability issues and 
suggesting solutions for improving these qualities for OGC web services; ideas presented 
in this discussion paper are candidates for inclusion in the anticipated OGC Best 
Practices document on this topic. Topics to be considered in this paper include: 

● Proposed service quality indicators and assessment framework; and 
● Recommendations and discussion of practices to improve service quality. 

2. Audience 

The primary audience for this discussion paper are geospatial data practitioners who 
prepare and make OGC web services available, OGC members and the OGC standards 
community. 
 
This report specifically targets how to make OGC web services, with particular emphasis 
on the OGC WMS, more usable and more effective for light users. By better meeting the 
needs of this group, the quality and usability of OGC web mapping services should 
increase for all. 
                                                
1 User persona development for the Federal Geospatial Platform identified four classes of users 

● Light - little to no familiarity with mapping: i.e. government policy analysts, economists, others with limited to no GIS experience 
● Moderate - some familiarity or expertise with mapping and mapping data: data managers and data analysts 
● Heavy - expert in geospatial analysis and development: GIS/geomatics practitioners, other power users 
● Web and application developers

4. Terms and Definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply. 

 
4.1 Quality of Service (QoS): Technical reliability and performance of a network 

service. Typically measured using metrics like error rates, throughput, availability 
and delay or request response time.  

4.2 Quality of (User) Experience (QoE): A holistic, qualitative measure of the 
customers' experience of the application or service. It encompasses both the user 
experience and the customer support experience of the evaluated applications 
and/or services.  

4.3 Spatial Data Service (SDS): a standardised technical communication interface 
containing operations to be invoked by a computer application to view, extract 
and spatial-temporally query a collection or stream of geospatial information and 
its metadata, to append new information or metadata to such a collection or 
stream, or to process geospatial information in such collection or stream. An SDS 
may be a Web Service operating over a request-response protocol such as HTTP, 
or it may be operating in some other paradigm and protocol, such as an event or 
publish-subscribe based model. An SDS may be exposed to its client applications 
or other services over the Internet, a closed IP-based network or some other 
networking protocol.  

4.4 OGC Spatial Data Service: A Spatial Data Service implementing one or more 
OGC Standards defining its operations and service description.  

5. Use Cases 

Goal 1: Inform a policy decision using a map view 
Primary Actor: Economic policy analyst Jan is a government employee responsible for 
policy recommendations to the Minister of Economic Development. Jan has a strong 
background in applied economics and development of public policies, but does not have 
much experience with data visualizations, spatial data analysis, or mapping. 

Scope: Jan finds and views a web map service in a simple web map visualization client. 

Level: OWS - Quality of Experience 

Preconditions: 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049

● The web map service is discoverable. There is metadata describing the service 
published online. 

● The metadata describing the service contains sufficient detail to allow a person to 
understand its purpose and content. 

● The language used in the metadata is simple and easy for a person to understand. 
It does not contain jargon, technical or esoteric terms, acronyms, etc. 

● The title of the service is human readable. 
● The title of the service is meaningful. It is informative and indicative of the data 

content that the service provides. 
● There is a legend provided with the web map service. 
● The content of the legend is human readable. 
● The content in the legend is simple and easy for a person to understand and use. 
● The legend is meaningful. It provides sufficient detail to allow a person to 

understand what is displayed on the map, without having to refer to other 
material. 

Story: Jan opens a catalogue application that contains metadata records for all 
government datasets. She enters the terms "education indigenous population Canada" in 
the free text search field. The search yields two results: a dataset called General 
Population Education and another dataset called Indigenous Persons Education. Jan 
selects both records and opens the metadata for the datasets. Both contain a link to a web 
map service. Jan chooses to view both web map services in the web map client provided 
by the catalogue application. Jan is able to successfully view and understand the content 
the web service makes available. The legend provides a clear indication of information 
presented in the map. The titles of the datasets and all map attributes and queries provide 
clear, simple, human readable information. Jan is satisfied with the information 
presented. She does not need to search further to make sense of the data and information 
presented to her by the service. 

Goal 2: Create a web map service optimized for public consumption 
Primary Actor: Dan, a spatial data manager. 

Scope: Dan, a spatial data manager working in a science-based federal department, is 
preparing a web map service for general publication on the web. The service will be 
accessible to the public. 

Level: OWS – Quality of Experience 

Preconditions: 

● Thought and effort expended to ensure a responsive, usable client-side map 
rendering, legend, symbology, attributes and metadata. 

● Complex datasets are optimized (e.g. minimally generalized) to ensure: 
○ Service is responsive and does not appear to fail to load; 
○ Service renders and returns information quickly; and 
○ Load on server is reduced. 

● Dataset attributes essential to understanding and using the web map service are 
made available; attributes of marginal interest are excluded. 

● Titles, attribute names, legends included in the web mapping service are human-
readable, meaningful and do not include jargon, overly technical or esoteric terms, 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049

or acronyms. 
Story: Dan is tasked with making simple feature information associated with a new and 
exciting dataset available to the public using an OGC:WMS. Dan has set up OGC:WMS 
before, but has not previously considered the needs of potential users of the service. 
Because this dataset is so topical, the web service is sure to be very popular and used for 
many different purposes. This causes Dan to think carefully about how the web service 
will be perceived, from both a performance perspective (response time, speed of 
rendering, availability, managing load on the server) and from a quality-of-content 
perspective (what attributes of the data are most interesting and which are less interesting, 
titles, attributes, legend content are provided in simple, human readable terms that 
contain a sufficient amount of meaningful intelligence). Dan references a best practices 
guide from a trusted agency to ensure that he provides the web mapping service in a way 
to make it responsive, clearly rendered, understandable and usable to a wide range of 
end-users. 

6. Topics to Discuss 

6.1 Service Quality Indicator Criteria 
 

As stated above, evaluating, comparing, and improving the QoE of Spatial Data Services 
is difficult without commonly-agreed and well-defined metrics for measuring the Quality 
of Experience. A set of fourteen service quality indicator criteria, developed during the 
2016 Refractions Research study for the Federal Geospatial Platform, are described 
below.  

The criteria are all aimed at assessing the quality of a web service in terms of the degree 
to which it conveys clearly understood information to the user. As noted earlier, the user 
is assumed to be a generalist, a light, non-expert user, but in most cases the criteria will 
likely be equally valid for all classes of users. 
	

1. Title - Meaningfulness  
 
Definition 
 
How meaningful a title is assessed to be is evaluated against the 
following categories: 
 

� Meaningful; Informative and clearly indicates content 
� Less meaningful; somewhat ambivalent; some use of 
jargon (overly technical, esoteric or organization-specific 
terms) or acronyms; could be improved 
� Not meaningful; insufficient to convey content; use of 
jargon (overly technical, esoteric or organization-specific 
terms) or acronyms; vague; missing information 

 
Rationale 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

12 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
The title may be the only information a user makes use of in order to determine whether a 
service is appropriate for their task. It is important to convey as much meaning as 
possible in a relatively short title. 
 

2. Consistency between Title and Map Content 
 
Definition 
 
This criterion is used to assess the degree to which the title and map content are 
consistent with one another. A simple three category evaluation is used: 
 

� Map displays what title states 
� Some inconsistency between what map displays and 
what title states 
� Mismatch between map and title 

 
Rationale 
 
To identify services which may have been misnamed in error or otherwise. 
 

3. Legend Appearance  
 
Definition 
 
The appearance of a legend includes the legibility of any symbols used, the legibility of 
the explanatory text, the three values are as follows: 
 

� Clearly legible 
� Poor legibility 
� Missing 
 

Rationale 
 
An initial survey of services identified that some services provided legend images that 
were difficult to read. The intent was to determine the extent of this problem. 
 

4. Legend Content  
 
Definition 
 
The degree to which the legend conveys meaningful content is assessed against four 
categories: 
 

� Not applicable, a legend is not provided (in some cases 
because it is not necessary, e.g., satellite imagery) 
� Meaningful; provides sufficient detail to allow user to 
easily and immediately understand map display 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

13 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

� Less meaningful - lacks some context, could be improved 
by adding units of measure, other information, but still 
allows for some comprehension of content 
� Not meaningful; a user must seek further information to 
understand content of legend 

 
Rationale 
 
To evaluate the actual content of the legend, regardless of its legibility (evaluated above). 
Is there an appropriate number of categories and is it clear what each of them mean? 
 

5. Feature Attribution  
 
Definition 
 
The number and relevance of the attributes provided for each feature. 
 

� Not applicable, no attributes (typically a raster service) 
� Sufficient attribution; attributes of essential interest to the 
dataset are included 
� Minimal attribution; sparse information; could be improved 
� Excessive attribution; contains unnecessary content 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify outlying cases of excessive or insufficient attribution. 
 

6. Feature Attribute Names  
 
Definition 
 
The understandability of the attribute names themselves. 
 

� Not applicable, no attributes (typically a raster service) 
� Meaningful; informative and clearly identifies attribute 
� Less meaningful; somewhat ambivalent, some use of 
jargon or acronyms, could be improved 
� Not meaningful; insufficient to convey meaning of attribute; use of jargon 
(overly technical, esoteric or organization-specific terms) or acronyms; vague, 
missing information 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify issues with the naming of attributes. 
 

7. Feature Attribute Completeness 
 
Definition 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

14 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
The completeness of attribute values. 
 

� Not applicable, no attributes (typically a raster service) 
� Appears complete - data not missing 
� Does not appear complete - empty fields; should be examined 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify cases where a service provides attribute(s) that rarely or never have values, 
possibly due to an error, or otherwise. Only cases of missing attribute values that were 
apparent from the assessment of the attribute values themselves have been identified. A 
thorough review of all features in all services is out of the scope of this assessment. 
 

8. Feature Attribute Values  
 
Definition 
 
The understandability of the attribute values. 
 

� Not applicable, no attributes (typically a raster service) 
� Conveys information/meaning effectively 
� Does not convey information/meaning effectively (excessive precision, code 
given but unclear as to what it means, vague); should be examine 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify issues with understanding the meaning of attribute values, as they are 
important for analysis of the data.  
 

9. Map Visualization  
 
Definition 
 
An overall measure of the quality and understandability of the map. 
 

� Clearly rendered map; quality of visualization is high, 
quickly and easily understood at appropriate scale 
 
� Poorly rendered map; quality of visualization is lacking; not easy to view or 
understand at appropriate scale 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify any of various issues that make it difficult to interpret the map. These include 
potential technical issues to do with re-projection or rendering, as well as issues with the 
data representation and cartography. 
 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

15 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

10. Map Cartography  
 
Definition 
 
How well color and symbols (if used) are used to add information and clarity to the map. 
 

� Use of color/color ramp and symbols effective 
� Use of color/symbols less effective, could be improved 
� Poor or ineffective use of color/color ramp or symbols, should be improved 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify cases where the use of color could or should be improved to enhance the 
usability of the service. While this assessment is somewhat subjective, some colors are 
objectively poor when displayed against the default basemap provided in the RAMP 
viewer. 
 

11. Map Scaling - Consistency 
 
Definition 
 
Whether or not the data is consistent at different zoom levels. 
 

� Consistent between scales; no rendering issues when 
zooming 
� Inconsistencies apparent between scales; missing areas, 
jumbled areas, etc. 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify services where, due to technical reasons or other, only a semi-random subset 
of the data is displayed at smaller zoom levels, while displaying more or all of the data at 
larger zooms. This can cause confusion for a user who doesn’t understand why it might 
be happening. 
 

12. Map Scaling Visibility  
 
Definition 
 
Whether or not the data is scale-dependent, as apparent from viewing the data in the web 
mapping client. 
 

� Can be viewed at all zoom levels 
� Cannot be viewed at all zoom levels; i.e., scale dependencies exist 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify layers which have scale dependencies, as they can be more difficult for users 
to make use of or understand. 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

16 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

13. Supporting Documents  
 
Definition 
 
The availability and understandability of supporting documentation for the service. 
 

� Available; complete and easy to understand 
� Available, incomplete or difficult to understand 
� Broken link 
� No supporting docs 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify missing or broken links, or a lack of supporting documentation for a service. 
Note that the supporting document(s) were only given cursory viewing; only in cases of 
complete jargon or otherwise expert-only readability were they assessed to be difficult to 
understand. A complete review of the supporting documentation is out of the scope of 
this assessment. 
 

14. Service Metadata  
 
Definition 
 
The service abstract and other information made available from the “Metadata” link 
displayed in the web mapping client. 
 

� Available and easy to understand 
� Available, not easily understood or not meaningful 
� Does not exist 
 

Rationale 
 
To determine the extent to which the metadata abstract is used to good effect. The service 
abstract is the most accessible description of the service’s data. It can provide some 
explanation of otherwise complex or technical data and/or provide insight into 
the methodology of the creation or capture of the data. 
 

Additional Criteria  
 

In addition to the fourteen criteria above, three further criteria are included that, although 
they are more subjective, still provide value in assessing the overall quality of the web 
services from a quality/usability perspective: 

1. Loading / Response Time  
 
Definition 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

17 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
This criterion refers to how quickly the service performs. Normal means that it either 
loaded immediately or quickly by requesting a reload. Frustrating implies that a number 
of tries were required or that the response time appeared excessive. Failed to load means 
the service would not load, regardless of multiple attempts and long wait times. 
 

� Normal 
� Frustrating 
� Failed to load 
 

Rationale 
 
To identify services where the response time caused problems in using the service. While 
this might seem to be subjective, the difference in usability between the “slowest” service 
assessed as normal and the “fastest/best” service assessed as frustrating can be quite 
significant; in the FGP assessment, the “frustrating” cases were all clear outliers.  
 

2. User Level Suitability  
 
Definition 
  
Suitable simply means easy to understand, not-confusing. It does not imply that the 
service cannot be improved or that it cannot be made easier to use. For simplicity, users 
are placed into just two categories, expert or non-expert. 
 

� Suitable for a light user, a non-expert 
� Suitable only for a moderate to heavy user, an expert 
 

Rationale 
 
To determine the target audience for the service. 
 

3. Overall Evaluation of Quality 
 
Definition 
 
The services can be compared against one another. Among the best does not mean that it 
cannot be improved, but it does suggest that it may serve as a worthwhile example. 
 

� Among the best 
� Not among the best 

 
 

6.2 Proposed practices to alleviate usability issues 
 

In this section, quality and usability issues are reviewed and recommended solutions

proposed. The issues and solutions are grouped using the assessment criteria described in 
section 6.1. 

6.2.1 Title 

 
Discussion 

Titles are expected to be human readable and comprehensible, and contain little or no 
jargon, abbreviations, acronyms, etc. Titles should also be well-formed: short, specific, 
relevant, providing a user with the ability to readily grasp the content of the service. 

A common issue with naming is having very general information, such as an organization 
name or a data series precedes the name of a specific data subject, pushing the main data 
subject further to the right and making it harder to read and assess, in various situations.  

In other cases, this additional name would follow the data subject, making the title 
excessively long or pushing other information in the title (location, date, scale) further to 
the right and out of view.  

Another issue is the use of unnecessary words in the title, such as “Geographic 
Distribution” or “Location.” These are generally implied by the fact that the data is being 
shown on a map. 

A common best practice on the web is to limit any title to 70 characters or less, to avoid 
truncation. Abiding by this rule can also keep titles relatively crisp and relevant. Shorter, 
simpler names with the most specific information at the front can be beneficial in 
situations where there is not enough room to display the entire title. It is also important 
that the title is not overly general. For example, Fisheries and Oceans Canada provides a 
service titled “Critical Habitat of Species at Risk,” which by name would appear to be a 
roll-up of all Critical Habitat layers - but it in fact only represents the critical habitat of 
aquatic species at risk. This is not clear until the product specification is downloaded and 
read. This title is therefore too general and can be misleading - “Aquatic Species at Risk - 
Critical Habitat” might be a better choice of title. 

Recommendations 

Title-1: Use human-readable language as titles and attribute names. Do not use program 
or other jargon, codes or other alphanumeric strings, and avoid using acronyms and 
abbreviations. 

Title-2: Keep service title length to 70 characters or less, starting with the most unique or 
important aspect of the data first. 

Title-3: Include enough specificity in the title to clearly identify the subject of the data, 
avoid also being overly general, suggesting the inclusion of data which is not included.

6.2.2 Fees and Access Constraints 
 

Discussion 

OWS services allow for the advertisement of ‘Fees’ and ‘AccessConstraints’ elements 
which identify whether there are costs or limitations on access against the entire OWS.  
While the content model for both of these elements is freetext, OGC standards 
recommend using the term ‘None’ (case insensitive) if no fees or access constraints exist 
and the server wishes to advertise them as such. 

Recommendations 

Fees-AccessConstraints-1: OWS servers should explicitly advertise Fees and Access 
Constraints as ‘None’ in lieu of not declaring these elements in a GetCapabilities 
response. 

 

6.2.3 Bounding Boxes 
 

Discussion 

OGC Web Services typically support a ‘GetCapabilities’ operation designed to provide a 
high-level overview (or ‘table of contents’) of a given OWS which includes a list of 
layers, feature types, coverages, or other data resource types.  A given OWS data 
resource includes support for advertising a bounding box which represents a minimum 
bounding rectangle or geospatial extent that represents the OWS data record’s geospatial 
area of interest. 

Below are some observations on how OWS server implementations handle this 
capability. 

● auto-calculation: the OWS server generates the bounding box value ‘on the fly’ or 
automagically.  While precise, this could bear a performance cost and overall 
Quality of Service. 

● global as default: the OWS server provides a default “-180, -90, 180, 90” type 
value which is representative of the entire globe.  This could result in poor 
search/discovery workflow when assessing the area of interest of an OWS data 
resource (data encompasses a very small, but important, area of interest). 

● omission: the OWS server provides no bounding value for an OWS data resource.  
This results in the user having no knowledge of the spatial characteristics of the 
OWS data resource. 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

20 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Recommendations 

BoundingBox-1: the bounding box should always represent the accurate area of interest 
of a given resource. 

BoundingBox-2: if an OWS data resource’s bounding box is truly global, the OWS server 
should advertise as such. 

6.2.4 Attribution 
 

Discussion 

OGC:WMS (via GetCapabilities) provides a wms:Attribution construct for any given 
Layer definition.  wms:Attribution provides references to the content provider (URL, 
Title, LogoURL).  wms:Attribution provides value for organizational branding 
(authoritative source) that OGC:WMS clients can use when building a user 
interface/client. 

Recommendations 

Attribution-1: WMS server implementations should implement wms:Attribution for the 
root Layer to provide overall attribution of the WMS server. 

Attribution-2: WMS server implementations may implement wms:Attribution for any or 
all child Layers. 

Attribution-3: WMS server implementations should ensure 
wms::Attribution/wms:LogoURL points to a web friendly graphic (PNG, JPEG, etc.), 
providing an image of smaller dimensions so as to display as a thumbnail by clients. 

 

6.2.5 Legend 
 

Discussion 

The legend is perhaps the most intuitive way for the service provider to give the user 
useful information about the layer.  

Depending on the configuration of the service and the type of data being displayed, the 
legend could be displayed in two different ways: either as a single image including all of 
the “color swatches” and all of the text descriptions, or as individual images for each 
color swatch accompanied by actual text. When the legend is displayed as a single image, 
the text descriptions are often difficult to read.  



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

21 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Another problem encountered with some of the legends is that they are too large (i.e. too 
long, too many attributes or categories) to be displayed in the layer list, without scrolling. 
Realistically even when the user scrolls down, the large number of categories could 
compromise their understanding of the display, depending upon the details. Excessively 
long legend descriptions can also cause the legend to be too wide to be easily viewable.  

When the legend includes numeric values, it should also include the appropriate units in 
the text description of each legend item. Standard International System of Units (SI) 
abbreviations (i.e. units) should be used in legend descriptions. 

Unexplained codes or jargon are not appropriate for a general audience but may be 
acceptable for expert use. 

Recommendations 

Legend-1: The legend should accurately reflect the content of the map. 

Legend-2: A legend should not be provided if the content is not categorized or otherwise 
has no need of a legend. 

Legend-3: Units, following SI conventions, should be included in the legend descriptive 
text when measurements are used. 

Legend-4: Codes, contractions or abbreviations should not be used in the legend 
descriptions if possible, with the exception of SI measurement units and map indexes. 

Legend-5: The legend should be legible. Ensure that method of constructing legend 
produces a clear, sharp image and easy to read text. 

 

6.2.6 Feature Attributes 
 

Discussion 

The assessment of the feature attributes is mostly about readability and understandability. 

The most common problem is the use of codes or jargon in either the attribute names or 
the attribute values. 

A minor concern is that floating-point numeric attribute values are often represented at 
their maximum precision, which can make the numbers difficult to read and falsely 
represents the actual accuracy of the underlying data. 

In some cases, point features included the latitude and longitude as attribute values. 
While this is commonly done as separate attributes, in at least one case the two values 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

22 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

were stored in a single attribute as text, separated by a space, which is not as readable for 
humans or computers. If the data is already being supplied with point geometry, 
provision of coordinates as attributes really is not necessary. 

Recommendations 

FeatureAttributes-1: The use of space-separated words or short phrases for feature 
attribute names should be used, as opposed to contractions, camelCase or underscores. 

FeatureAttributes-2: The unit of measure in the feature attribute name for measured 
values should be specified as a separate attribute using SI recognized units. The units 
used should relate to accuracy and common usage (e.g., the value for the area of a 
wetlands polygon of 2.34 km 2 should not be given as 2,338,062 m 2). 

FeatureAttributes-3: Numerical precision (i.e., the number of digits) should be given to 
correspond to and reflect actual accuracy level of the dataset and not to the maximum, 
machine generated values. 

FeatureAttributes-4: Feature attributes not be included unless they normally have values. 

FeatureAttributes-5: Longitude and latitude should not be given as feature attributes of 
point data, since equivalent information is contained in the geometry. 

 

6.2.7 Cartographic Representation 
 

Discussion 

In the example below from the Pelagic Seabird Atlas - Average Grid Cell Density layer, 
each grid location may have multiple “stacked” polygons in the same location, each 
storing observation data for a different species. The user has no way to control which 
species or which polygon’s attributes are displayed when clicking on any grid cell, so 
making use of this data is difficult. 

Alternatively or additionally, a single heat map could be produced showing the number of 
species found in each grid cell. For many casual users this might be much more useful.

6.2.7.1 Color 
Here is an example of a layer from the Critical Habitat for Species at Risk series of data.  

 

It is initially difficult to recognize any of the subject features on the map because of the 
small size of the polygons. Even after zooming in on a specific polygon, it remains 
difficult to see due to the use of a muted yellowish color that is similar to both the yellow 
background and the yellow used for the streets. This color may have been chosen to 
differentiate this species from the other species in the series or perhaps simply to avoid 
garish colors; however, against the default basemap the contrast is much too low. 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

24 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

While the opportunity for color clashes always exists, one approach might be to use less 
saturated colors for the basemap, and more saturated colors for the layers of interest. This 
should at least help increase the visibility a single data layer shown over the basemap. 
What if the same layer might be used as part of a different basemap? This approach also 
increases the likelihood of interlayer color conflicts, because it reduces the color space 
available to the non-basemap data layers. These issues will be discussed further in the 
Service Interoperability section. 

6.2.7.2 Symbology 
The “Carbon monoxide emissions by facility” map shown below displays very effective 
symbology. The colors are very clear and meaning is enhanced by the different sizes 
employed. The colors on the legend and map are of different hues, which helps with the 
user experience. As well, no confusion exists with the background colors or basemap 
details, although a brighter yellow for 100 to <500 would provide greater contrast with 
the background. The one real deficiency is the of gray for No Recordings; it is difficult to 
see. If No Recordings were symbolized by a gray circle with a heavy black boundary it 
would work better. The legend could be improved by specifying the time period to which 
the number of tonnes applies. 

 

“The Major Projects Inventory - Point Geometry” shown below uses circles, squares, and 
triangles for different kinds of projects, as shown in the large image below. The colors 
are sufficiently different to aid recognition as are the different sizes of the symbols. Also 
note that the darker tones in all three cases are used for Planned, whereas lighter tones are 
employed for Under Construction. The black boundary used to indicate the largest 
planned and under construction sites is used on only a single site across the country 
(shown on the map snippet on the left).

This raises the question of whether the legend should 
contain symbols that cannot be found anywhere in the 
country, as is the case with Mining, More than 5 billion, 
Under Construction. On the other hand, by including the 
category it is clear in this 
case that nothing has been 
forgotten. 

The legend should also 
indicate the units used, which will differ depending upon 
the subject. 

 

The “Metal Mines - Producing Mines” map below shows symbols with a flat design, 
characterized by no use of gradients, textures or drop shadows. Not only is this in line 
with modern design, as used on smartphones for example, but it also makes displaying 
the symbols more compatible with different map rendering technologies.

6.2.7.3 Labelling 
Relatively few layers had any labelling of features. Below is an example of a good use of 
labelling. On the left are the NTS 1:250 000 blocks shown with labels and 1:50 000 
subdivisions. Zooming in further (on the right) shows the labels for the 1:50 0000 
mapsheets. The labels are clear and the overlay against the basemap is quite well done in 
both cases. Zooming further (not shown) shows the blocks and the labels for the 1:20 000 
NTS grid.

In the Historic Treaties map below, labels and different colors would do much to improve 
the useful information content of this map. The various green colors are difficult to 
identify with certainty with the listing in the legend. So this service has issues with labels, 
colors, legend content, and legend length. 

 

In the case of feature level services, some viewers display a feature “name” when a 
feature is hovered-over with the mouse cursor. It’s not uncommon to find when a feature  
“name” is displayed when hovering, it is a code or jargon of some sort, where a long-



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

28 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

form name is actually available in the data. Since this form of labeling does not take up 
permanent space on the map image, it seems there is no reason not to use the most 
descriptive name. 

6.2.7.4 Scaling 
For a general use web service, it is important that something be clearly visible on the map 
at all resolutions. In the case of small polygon data, or small raster areas, it is often 
invisible on the map at a smaller (i.e. national or provincial) zoom level and would better 
be represented as point symbols or a polygon area to help a user navigate to where the 
data is and zoom in on it. 

Conversely, it should not be possible to request more data than can be returned in a 
reasonable period of time; when zoomed out, either more general data should be 
displayed or a point symbol used. For feature-level services, expert users should still be 
able to access the full detail data. 

6.2.7.5 Imagery 
This example from the “Swift Current LiDAR Project 2009 - Orthos” layer shows some 
edge artifacts likely caused by re-tiling or re-projecting the ortho image tiles. This sort of 
problem may affect the usability of the data from an analytical perspective. Of more 
importance here is that it is an assault on the viewer’s sensibilities and should be easily 
avoidable with due care taken in processing the data. 

 

Another point about LiDAR imagery concerns their meaning to the typical user. Such 
imagery is often shown as shades of gray with the darker sections showing lower 
elevations and the lighter sections displaying higher elevations. This should be indicated 
through the legend preferably and otherwise by the metadata. Even more useful would be 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

29 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

to show the range of elevation in the area of question. The experienced user may realize 
that the dark shades represent lower areas, but will not necessarily know if the difference 
between these lower areas and the higher elevation areas is centimeters, meters, tens of 
meters, etc. 

 

Recommendations 

CartographyColor-1: Colors for features/layers should be chosen that are in clear contrast 
with those on the basemap. 

CartographyColor-2: Colors appearing on individual layers should be readily 
distinguishable from one another, unless by intention they are of the same color. 

CartographyColor-3: If it is known that certain layers are likely to be used in combination 
with one another, then care should be taken to ensure that similar colors are not used on 
the different layers. 

CartographySymbology-1: Symbols should have colors that contrast sufficiently with the 
basemap details and with one another. Subdued or pastel colors should be avoided. 

CartographySymbology-2: If the symbols include contrasting boundaries used to 
distinguish symbols from one another, then the boundaries should be comparatively thick 
so that they are easily discerned on different devices and screens of differing qualities. 

CartographySymbology-3: The use of different sizes and colors in combination is 
recommended for rendering different numeric categories. 

CartographySymbology-4: The use of different shapes, such as triangles, squares, and 
circles, is recommended for portraying different series on the same map. 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

30 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

CartographySymbology-5: Connotative symbols with varying shapes or internal icons 
can be used so long as color is also used to distinguish them. 

CartographySymbology-6: All symbols should have a flat design, without the use of 
gradients, textures, or drop shadows. 

CartographyLabelling-1: If used, labels should be short and readily understood directly or 
from the legend, with the exception of the label as a map index, in which case it is 
acceptable if the explanation is found in the metadata. 

CartographyLabelling-2: Where large polygonal features are displayed, labels are 
recommended if practical to implement. For small features on the map, care must be 
taken that the label does not conflict with other labels or with boundaries. 

CartographyLabelling-3: In cases where feature name is configured to display when 
hovered over, avoid providing codes, acronyms or other cryptic text if a long-form name 
is available in the data.  

CartographyScaling-1: Services should not allow requests for excessive amounts of data 
that would cause the server or connection to timeout. If a service provides only high-
resolution data, it should only be available at large scales. 

CartographyScaling-2: Wherever possible, lower resolution data or alternative 
representations (e.g. a point symbol instead of a set of lines or polygons) should be 
provided at smaller scales to enable the user to navigate the map to the data of interest. 

CartographyImagery-1: Quality assurance should be carried out so that a proper 
orthomosaic is available, without obvious artifacts. 

CartographyImagery-2: When a color gradient is used to visualize the data, such as a 
greyscale map of elevation data, the legend should indicate the values associated with key 
colors in the gradient, e.g., that the lighter and darker areas represent higher and lower 
elevations, respectively. 

6.2.8 Metadata, Series and Supporting Documents 
 

Discussion 

The service “abstract” should contain at least a short overview describing the dataset. In 
some cases, the provided abstract provides no more information than the title of service.  

Ideally a link to a “product specification” or similar document should be provided if one 
exists. A suggested standard for the minimum information that should be provided in 
such a document could be: 

● A data dictionary for codes or terminology; 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

31 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

● Description of the methodology for the creation/capture of the data; or 

● Reference to any related laws or standards. 

The name of the “data series” that a service belongs to should be recorded in the service 
metadata, searchable and displayed to the user through the map viewer interface. The 
map viewer’s “metadata” display should include the name of the data series, links to view 
the metadata of the other layers in the same series, and links to add some or all of those 
other layers to the map. 

Recommendations 

MetadataSeries&SupportingDocs-1: Every service should include an abstract with 
meaningful content. The content should include more detail than the title, so that in a few 
sentences the reader has a fair idea as to what the service provides. 

MetadataSeries&SupportingDocs-2: Any documents intended for a general audience 
should minimize the use of jargon and abbreviations. If such terms are commonplace or 
judged to be unavoidable, they should be briefly defined. 

MetadataSeries&SupportingDocs-3: It is strongly encouraged that service metadata 
include a link to a “product specification” or similar document. Such document(s) should 
include as a minimum a data dictionary, a description of the creation/capture 
methodology, and references to any related laws or standards. 

MetadataSeries&SupportingDocs-4: Ensure support for the concept of “data series” in 
metadata records. 

6.2.9 Service Interoperability 
 

Discussion 

Issues involving service interoperability are often identified during a quality of 
experience assessment. In particular, there are frequently difficulties with: 

● Visualization of a service displayed over a basemap; 

● Visualization of multiple services when displayed together; and 

● Querying two similar services. 

An example of poor visualization of a service over a basemap is shown below, from the 
service “Sidney Island Shorebird Surveys - Transects Line”. 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049

The thin light green line 
is almost invisible 
against the background. 
Visibility would be 
improved with a thicker 
line of a more contrasting 
color. With so much 
green on the basemap, 
the color of the line 
should have a different 
hue altogether. In the 
current case the line is so 
thin and light that even 
tested against a different 

colored basemap, such as a shaded relief option, its rendering needs improvement. 

The following example shows the difficulty in visualizing and querying two services 
together. In this case, several layers in a related series of data (Canadian Environmental 
Sustainability Indicators (CESI)) were displayed on the map together. These layers use 
the same symbology of colored points: increasing in size and tending toward red as they 
get larger (worse). This results in a very readable map, individually. However, when 
multiple CESI layers are loaded at the same time, it is impossible to determine which 
symbol relates to which dataset, just by viewing the map. Furthermore, querying the map 
shows that the two data sets have nearly identical attributes. It is difficult to recognize 
which layer’s feature has been selected, because the map client used in this case did not 
identify from which layer the results were returned. Looking carefully at the attributes of 
the feature helps in this case because the attribute name “Sox” corresponds to the name of 
the pollutant. In a worse case, it is possible that multiple datasets could share identical 
attribution and styling and be indifferentiable when queried.  



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

33 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

The way around these problems is to be able change the styling of a service (colors, 
linetypes, and/or symbols) dynamically, depending on the situation. Three relevant 
solutions to this problem are recognized: 

● WMS Named styles; 

● WMS Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) support; and 

● Client-side style definition and rendering of layers. 

The WMS specification (all versions since 1.0.0) allows for each layer to support zero or 
more named styles, with the names of the styles (and other descriptive information) 
specified in the layer’s capabilities in the WMS server’s capabilities document. This 
allows the service provider to provide more than one style for a given layer and requires 
only minimal support on the client side (allowing the user to select from a list of style 
names).  

The WMS specification also provides for optional support of the SLD specification, 
which includes the ability for the client to provide an SLD document describing how to 
style the layer, with a getMap request. This allows the client to specify the style 
information in the SLD, and have the server render the map according to that SLD. This 
implies a sophisticated client application, which provides a user interface to define the 
style, generates the appropriate SLD XML, and makes use of an XML-based HTTP 
POST getMap request to send the SLD to the server (instead of the typical HTTP GET 
getMap request). While this provides excellent flexibility and configurability, supporting 



 
 
 

OGC 17-049 

34 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

it on the server side allows the user to specify arbitrarily complex styling that could cause 
excessive workload for the server. To reduce the level of sophistication required in the 
client, another approach is for the service provider to provide additionally, alternate 
SLDs. These alternate SLDs would work similarly to named styles, except instead of 
being defined in the server configuration, and referenced by name, they would be defined 
by a separate SLD file and reference using a URL. It is even possible for a third party to 
define and provide the SLD, a job that could be filled potentially by an FGP styling team. 
This requires some basic support in the client and a way to communicate the availability 
of the alternate SLDs to the client, likely through some sort of metadata. 

Where the service sends feature-level data, not map images, the client renders them to a 
map image using the styling suggested by the service. Some software supports complete 
restyling of the data on the client-side, and so can a sufficiently sophisticated web-map 
client. This provides the greatest flexibility, but requires that both the server and the 
client handle the individual features and coordinates being rendered on the map, which in 
some cases is a significant overhead, even preventing some layers from loading or 
displaying properly because of the volume of data. 

Recommendations 

ServiceInteroperability-1: Implement support in web-mapping clients for WMS named 
styles, and recommend that WMS services offer more than one named style. In the case 
of data series, one style should be visually distinguishable from other data in the series, 
and another style should be similar or identical to other data in the series. 

ServiceInteroperability-2: Investigate the compatibility of different services with SLD. It 
should be determined if a single SLD can be published and used correctly by WMS 
servers from different vendors (Mapserver, Geoserver, ArcGIS Server). Further 
investigation will be required to determine who should be responsible for producing and 
maintaining such SLDs, and how they can be discovered and used. 

Endnote 

Recommendations for web service quality found in this discussion paper were prepared 
by Mark Sondheim and Chris Hodgson of Refractions Research for Cindy Mitchell and 
Joost Van Ulden of the Federal Geospatial Platform Initiative, Canada Centre for Remote 
Sensing and Earth Observation, Earth Sciences Sector, Natural Resource Canada. Initial 
study was based on a quality assessment of 160 web map services offered by ten 
Canadian federal government departments in November 2016.
