Preface 

This Engineering Report was prepared as a deliverable for the OGC Web Services, Phase 
8 (OWS-8) initiative of the OGC Interoperability Program. The document presents the 
work completed with respect to the Observation Fusion OF-Tracking sub-thread within 
OWS-8. 

This Engineering Report describes and evaluates the specification of EO-WCS ATS and 
the implementation of ETS for use within an OGC SOA processing chain. 

In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of technology providers work 
together to solve specific geoprocessing interoperability problems posed by the 
Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, 
pilot projects, interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - all 
designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC 
standards. 

The OWS-8 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommend to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-8 initiative be organized around 
the following threads: 

    * Observation Fusion 

    * Geosynchronization (Gsync) 

    * Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 

    * Aviation

testbed and is available for download:

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

As a thread of activity in OWS-8, Observation Fusion thread combines the OGC Earth 
Observation Web Coverage Service (EO-WCS) standard and architecture with the results 
of the recent OGC development of EO-WCS abstract test suites (ATS) and executable 
test suites (ETS).  Coverage was one of three categories in of the Fusion Standards study.  
The EO-WCS architecture was designed to enable web-accessible earth observation 
coverages offered by a WCS 2.0 server through common interfaces and encodings.  An 
Earth observation coverage is a coverage extended with EO Metadata [OGC 10-157r2] 
and bound to a location on the Earth. EO Coverages are a subtype of either GMLCOV:: 
RectifiedGridCoverage or GMLCOV::ReferenceableGridCoverage. 
The purpose of the OGC EO-WCS framework is to provide interoperability among 
multidisciplinary earth observation coverages, as well as to serve as an interoperable 
bridge between earth sensors, models and simulations, networks, and decision support 
tools. The development of EO-WCS ATS and ETS continues the further refinement and 
extension of EO-WCS with an emphasis on Earth Observation tasks.

5 OGC® OWS-8 EO-WCS ATS and ETS Overview 

The topic for this report addresses a need to explore the use of EO-WCS ATS and ETS to 
improve the EO-WCS implementations and evaluate how much the specification itself 
supports testing of these implementations.  EO-WCS ATS is specified according to the 
requirements in the EO-WCS specification and provides a basis for developing 
requirement-consistent ETS.  The ETS is specified in OGC Compliance Test Language 
(CTL). Currently, OGC Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation (CITE) 
program uses OGC’s Test, Evaluation, and Measurement (TEAM) Engine, which is fed 
with the specified CTL scripts to test these implementations. 

6 ATS 

According to the standards studied, an EO-WCS implementation must satisfy the 
following system characteristics to be conformant with this specification:  

 EO Data Model, see Table 1; 
 Service operations, such as GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage, GetCoverage and 

DescribeEOCoverageSet, see Table 2;  
 Service extensions, see Ttable 3; 
 Service protocols, see Table 4.

XML schema/schematron 
validation*.  

 
NOTE * Tests on specific overage format encodings are stubbed because schema/schematron 
validation approach is not able to handle encodings other than xml.

GetCapabilities A.1.29-1.37 Check according to the

Describe Coverage A.1.38-1.39 Check according to the 
corresponding requirements 

GetCoverage A.1.40-1.45 Depends on coverage format 
encodings* 

DescribeEOCoverageSet  A.1.46-1.61 Check according to the 
corresponding requirements 

 

NOTE * If the response is in a pure format other than GML, no XML schema/schematron validation 
applies. If the response is in a mixed-format, XML schema/schematron validation applies. In this case, 
testing on RangeSet is not available because the corresponding mapping mechanism is not provided. If the 
response is in GML, XML schema/schematron validation applies. However, the performance would be 
very poor in real practice. 

Table 3— Service extensions 

Name ATS Approach 
Service 
extensions* 

A.1.62-66 Determine the list of supported extensions 
via a valid GetCapabilities request; check 
that the extension required is listed. Invoke 
extension test if it exists.  

 

NOTE * Service extension test is stubbed if the corresponding specification is not available. 

Table 4— Service protocols 

Name ATS Approach 
Service 
protocols * 

A.2-

Determine the list of supported 
protocols and send requests as 
defined. Check that proper 
responses are returned.

§ GetCapabilities request contains a sections element

§ DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains a containment parameter and the 
response 

§ DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains dimensionTrim elements with 
dimension parameters and the response 

§ DescribeEOCoverageSet request contains crs and the response 

§ Get/KVP and SOAP protocol-bindings  

§ Service extension supports

8 Issues found 

8.1 Consistency 

Should the EO-WCS be consistent with WCS 2.0? Semantically, the answer is yes. That 
is because the WCS 2.0 defines the abstract interfaces and the abstract data model and the 
EO-WCS defines the profile based on these abstract models. Specifically, the EO-WCS is 
inherited from the WCS 2.0.  

Syntactically, the answer is yes. However, the EO-WCS adds specific domain knowledge 
based on WCS 2.0 and create some mandatory ingredients. These extra ingredients are 
not recognized by the WCS 2.0. Therefore, EO-WCS implementations will not pass the 
WCS 2.0 test by the schema validation unless these extra ingredients are added to XML 
Schema any element in WCS 2.0.

8.2 Extra test 

Should WCS 2.0 soap extension (OGC 09-149r1 req8)  test the service WSDL, which is a 
W3C service description language and contains duplicate information in the GetCapabil-
ities response? Obviously, CITE TEAMENGINE does not know this WSDL. However, 
both W3C WSDL file and OGC  GetCapabilities response should contain some consist-
ent information on the service description. Therefore, an extra test is needed to test such a 
phenomenon. Then, the question is how to invoke this extra test on WSDL and build the 
connection between W3C and OGC.  

8.3 Inconclusive result 

 
In face of a bad Internet connection the following error will always be reported back: 

Cannot resolve the name 'xml:lang' to a(n) 'attribute 
declaration' component 
 
Although the implementation may be correct, TEAM Engine treats this as a test fail. 
However, this should be an “inconclusive result due to failed server connection”. 

8.4 Can not test invalid requests in SOAP 

 
Invalid requests, which are needed to test the service, are not supported. For example, 

OGC 10-140 
A.1.46 

/conf/eowcs/describeEOCoverageSet-request-structure 

Test method: Send DescribeEOCoverageSet requests with valid and invalid request 
structure.  

Pass test if appropriate valid results or exceptions, resp., are delivered. 

Whenever an invalid request is sent by SOAP, an error “DOMSender: no start 
node defined” will be reported.   

OGC 06-126r2 Subclause 9.3.3.10 states that “Body: The <body> element contains the 
data to be included in the SOAP body. The element should contain XML compliant with 
the web service interface.” Note the “should”.
