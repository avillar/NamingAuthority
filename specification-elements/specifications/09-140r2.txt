Preface 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC®) conducted a series of tests that examined the 

interoperability, suitability and performance of National System for Geospatial-

Intelligence (NSG) Profiles provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 

(NGA) of four OGC Standards, Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), 

Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Catalog Service (CAT).  In the study, vendors, users, 

and other interested parties conducted Technology Integration Experiments (TIEs) and 

mutually refined clients, services, interfaces and protocols in the context of a hands-on 

engineering experience expected to shape the future NGA, NSG and Geospatial 

Intelligence (GEOINT) web based distribution.

 NSG Plugweek Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC Engineering Report (ER) documents findings of the NSG Plugweek which was 

conducted via the unclassified OGC Network to address requirements stated in the OGC 

Request for Quotation and Call for Participation in the NSG Profiles Plugweek Pilot (NPP) 

[1] sponsored by the National Geospatial-intelligence Agency (NGA). This ER addresses 

issues that arose, and provides recommendations for the refinement of NSG Profiles of 

OWS WMS, WFS, WCS and CSW specifications, OGC Specifications, CITE Tests, and 

the IE/Plugweek process.  Recommendations in this ER will be considered in the planning 

of future activities. 

1.2 The Open Geospatial Consortium  

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international not for profit voluntary 

industry consensus standards organization that provides a forum and proven processes for 

the collaborative development of free and publicly available interface specifications (open 

standards).  These open standards enable easier access to and use of geospatial information 

and improved interoperability of geospatial technologies (across any device, platform, 

system, network or enterprise) to meet the needs of the global community.  OGC open 

standards have been implemented broadly in the marketplace and are helping to foster 

distributed and component technology solutions that geo-enable web, wireless, and location 

based services as well as broader government and business IT enterprises worldwide. 

To accomplish the mission of the Consortium, OGC conducts three programs: 

 OGC‘s Specification Program facilitates formal consensus-based committees, working 
groups and special interest groups that establish a forum for OGC‘s industry, 

academic/research and user community members to collaboratively identify, prioritize 

and advance solutions to meet standards needs of the global community.   

 OGC‘s Interoperability Program promotes rapid prototyping, testing and validation of 
emerging standards through fast paced testbeds, experiments, pilot initiatives and 

related feasibility studies.   

 OGC‘s Outreach and Community Adoption Program conducts programs (training, 
articles in publications, workshops, conferences, etc) to promote awareness and 

implementation of OGC standards across the global community.  

This NSG Plugweek initiative was an element of the OGC Interoperability Program.  The 

initiative was based upon interest and contributions from several OGC Member 

organizations, including the NGA, Northrop Grumman, Intergraph, ERDAS, Cubewerx, 

Compusult, Snowflake, and The Carbon Project.

5 Overview 

5.1 Objectives of the Study 

The primary objective of the NSG Plugweek was to ―examine the suitability and 

performance of NGA provided Profiles of four OGC Standards, Web Map Service (WMS), 

Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Catalog Service (CAT).‖ 

A secondary objective was to exercise the TFDM model through server and client 

demonstrations. It was not an objective of this study to ―report on relative capabilities and 

performance of any of the services that companies provide.‖  [1]

5.2 Plugweek Process, Activities, Procedures, and Artifacts  

The NSG Plugweek was run as an OGC Pilot Project with a WBS [2] and CONOPS [4] 

that were modified to focus on services and schemas instead of use cases [3].  Figure 1 

below shows the target architecture for this effort. [3]  

 

Figure 1  NPP Target Architecture 

 

The Plugweek itself was preceded by many months of preparation by NGA, and two 

months of WBS activities by NGA, CITE test developers, and Plugweek participants.  

These activities and the artifacts produced therein are described in the following sub-

sections.

5.2.1 NGA Developed Profiles of OGC Standards for the NSG 

The NGA developed Class 2 performance profiles that both restrict and extend the WMS 

version 1.1.1, WFS version 1.1.0, and WCS version 1.0.0 OGC standards in conformance 

with the provisions of ISO 19106 to assure that the services specified by those standards 

―fulfill their intended purpose and are fit for use‖ [5], [7], [9].   Each profile consisted of a 

descriptive document [5], [7], [9] and a prescriptive compliance spreadsheet [6], [8], [10].  

The compliance spreadsheets provide conformance test details and document the status 

(Informative, Recommended, Optional, or Mandatory) of all clauses in both the referenced 

standard, and the NGA profile.  Note that these NSG profiles were not of the latest versions 

of the OGC standards.  Rather, they were of the latest versions of the OGC standards that 

had been approved and included in the DISR [18]. 

 CAT 2.0.1 

 GML 3.1.1 

 Filter 1.1 

 SLD 1.0 

 WFS 1.1 

 WMC 1.1 

 WMS 1.1.1 

5.2.2 NGA Funded Development of NSG Profile Compliance Tests 

The NGA funded development of automated tests of the NSG Profiles described in the 

preceding section [12].  These tests were extensions and adaptations of OGC CITE 

compliance tests ―based on the same software used for OGC‘s CITE test engines‖. 

[5],[7],[9]. See the NSG Plugweek CITE Tests Table below for links to descriptive web 

pages for these tests. 

5.2.3 NGA Provided EC for TFDM exerpt of NAS 

The NGA provided a spreadsheet [11] containing the Topographic Data Store Entity 

Catalog (TDS EC) Version 2.0 for topographic features from the NSG EC.   ―The TDS EC 

specifies the complete set of allowable feature types, geometries, attributes, and 

enumerants, as well as their individual specifications (e.g., definition, datatype, value 

range) for this suite of four Topographic Data Stores.‖ [11]   

5.2.4 NGA Developed GML schemas for TFDM from TDS EC 

The NGA developed GML schemas for version 3.1.1 (OGC 03-105r1) that also conformed 

to SF-0 (OGC 06-049r1) [14].  These schemas included 17 ―.xsd‖ schema documents, 

defined 500 feature classes, and were in subsequent Plugweek activities.  NGA also 

developed GML schemas for version 3.2.1 (OGC 07-036) that followed the SF-0 design 

pattern to support future work [15].  These schemas were not used in Plugweek activities 

because the versions of OGC services selected for use in the Plugweek did not support 

GML version 3.2.1.

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

5.2.5 NGA Provided TDS data  

The NGA provided two sets of TDS vector data for different regions that conformed to the 

TFDM and implemented the NFDD.   

5.2.6 Participant transformed TDS data to GML 

A Plugweek WFS participant transformed the TDS data to GML SF-0 following the 

guidance provided in the TDS EC {11], and validated it using the NGA GML schemas.  

One data set included data for 50 feature types; the other for 25 feature types.  The feature 

types in the two data sets overlapped, so that in total 65 feature types of the 500 included in 

the GML schemas were used in Plugweek activities [14]. 

5.2.7 Project Kickoff  2009-09-10 via Teleconference and Online Document Sharing 

NGA Sponsor and OGC IP Staff lead a project kickoff via teleconference and online 

document sharing.  They reiterated that the project goal was to vet profiles for NSG use, 

and make online distribution of HSG data via OGC services and encodings a reality.  They 

informed Plugweek participants that the TFDM team participation that had been expected 

during the project to address NSG profile refinement would not happen until after the 

Plugweek was concluded.  They also clarified two items of project scope.  First, the CSW 

v2.0.1 core queryables were required, but others were optional for testing.  Second, the 

Plugweek would not test PKI level security. 

5.2.8 Collaborative Planning and Work via Teleconferences and Email 

NGA Sponsors, OGC Staff, and Plugweek participants met online for weekly 

teleconferences and exchanged email daily to refine the plans for Plugweek activites, 

resolve data errors, announce server status, coordinate TIEs, and to identify and resolve 

other issues. 

5.2.9 CITE Testing  

CITE testing before and during the NSG Plugweek was based on both standard OGC CITE 

Tests, and more stringent NSG Profile tests.  Details of the tests are available from the web 

pages accessible via the links in the following table.  Issues with CITE tests were recorded 

in the on-line CITE issue tracker, and most were resolved before or during the Plugweek 

[11].  Results of the tests were recorded in an on-line spreadsheet and are reported in the 

Plugweek Outcomes section below.

5.2.10 TIEs  

Plugweek Participants conducted TIEs before plugweek as servers became available, and 

resolved issues and shared results via email.  Results are reported in the Plugweek 

Outcomes section below. 

5.2.11 NSG Plugweek 2009-10-05 – 2009-10-08 

Monday was devoted to client and server setup, shakedown testing, and refinement of the 

contents and format of plugweek results spreadsheets [13].  The following table shows the 

initial three columns in the first sheet of the results spreadsheet.  The first two columns list 

the TIE test to be performed.  The third column cross-references the test to NGA 

requirements spreadsheet item numbers [6],[8],[10].  Items selected for inclusion in the 

spreadsheet were those that were optional in OGC specifications but mandatory in the NSG 

profile, and other items that had not been completely address by CITE tests.  Additional 

columns for each Service / Participant Server / Data Set combination followed to the right.  

Participants filled the cells in these additional columns with ―G‖ for success, ―Y‖, for 

partial success, and ―R‖ for failure, or ―N/O‖ for not observable, or ―N/A‖ for not 

applicable.   For cells that received a ―Y‖ or ―R‖, participants recorded the cell row and 

column, HTTP request and response values, and notes describing the situation in the second 

sheet in the results spreadsheet. Summaries of results are reported in the Plugweek 

Outcomes section below.

6.2 Plugweek Crosscutting Issues 

Crosscutting issues that arose during Plugweek are documented in this sub-section.  These 

issues spanned multiple NSG Profiles and OGC Specifications, or resulted in findings and 

recommendations in more than one category covered in the sections that follow, which 

refer back to the sub-sections in which the issues are described.  Issues that affect only one 

NSG Profile and/or OGC Specification are discussed in the sections to which they apply. 

6.2.1 CRS Specification Issue 

Different OGC specifications for WMS, WFS, WCS, CAT, GML, OWS_Common, and 

different versions of those specifications require different forms of CRS specification.  

Those differences carried over automatically into the NSG profiles.  It is a significant 

hindrance to interoperability long recognized in the OGC community to have to use 

different CRS specifications for different OGC Specifications.   

The TDS EC 2.0 CRS Specification was not supported by several of the service versions in 

the NSG profiles.  See the CRS Specification Requirements for TDS EC 2.0 in Table 4 

below.  Consequently, a ―private‖ agreement had to be reached among the sponsor and 

participants on which CRS specifications to use for the NSG Plugweek tests, and to clarify 

that in the URN form of a CRS specification, two colons must appear in a row if the 

version is missing. Widespread adoption of future versions of OWS that follow the 

guidance of OGC Document 07-092r3 should eventually eliminate this issue.   

Table 4 below summarizes the results of the specification review in the following 

subsections.

6.2.1.1 TDS EC CRS Specification  

The TDS EC [11] provides the following CRS specification in section 5.3.9.2 on the 

Overview sheet: 

This GML-based SF-0 conformant encoding for the TDS EC adopts the practices 

established by the DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS: 

http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/irs/DDMS/). 

The allowed values of the XML srsName attribute shall be exactly one of the following: 

 (a)  World Geodetic System 1984 – Geographic, 2-Dimensional, identified by the URI:  

   http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84E_2D 

(b)  World Geodetic System 1984 – Geographic, 3-Dimensional, identified by the URI:  

   http://metadata.dod.mil/mdr/ns/GSIP/crs/WGS84E_3D  

The axis order for these CRSs is geodeticLatitude, geodeticLongitude [, ellipsoidalHeight]. 

6.2.1.2 WMS 1.1.1 CRS Specification 

Section 6.5.5.1 EPSG Namespace for CRS of the WMS 1.1.1 specification (OGC 01-

068r3) describes the use of EPSG numeric identifiers, e.g. ―EPSG:4326” for WGS84.   It 
also describes a convention for WMS whereby “the returned image is implicitly 
projected using a pseudo-Plate Carrée projection that plots Longitude along the X-axis 
and Latitude along the Y-axis.”  Unfortunately, that convention is at odds with the 
EPSG:4326 CRS axis order definition of latitude as the first axis and longitude as the 
second axis.  This is the only way to specify a geographic CRS (not projected) in WMS 
1.1.1.  The alternative AUTO Namespace for CRS described in section 6.5.5.2 is for 
projected CRSs.  The only other option in WMS 1.1.1 is an undefined CRS.  
Unfortunately, there is no way to specify a CRS in accordance with both the TDS EC 
CRS Specification and the WMS 1.1.1 CRS Specification.

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

6.2.1.3 WMS 1.3.0 CRS Specification 

Section 6.7.3 Layer CRS of the WMS 1.3.0 specification (OGC 06-042) provides for two 

types of CRS namespace identifiers, ―Label‖ and ―URL‖.  It also describes a convention 
for WMS whereby “Coordinates shall be listed in the order defined by the CRS and shall 
be mapped appropriately”.  It specifies three ―Label‖ identifiers, ―CRS‖, ―EPSG‖, and 
―AUTO2‖.  In Annex B, it defines three geographic CRS identifiers for the WGS84, 

NAD27, and NAD83 datums.  The definition in Section B.3 Layer CRS using WGS84 

longitude-latitude (CRS:84) allows for the (continued from WMS 1.1.1) use of WGS84 

with axes reversed from the order specified by EPSG 4326.   

 

As in WMS 1.1.1, the CRS namespace (e.g., EPSG) label is followed by a colon and a 

coordinate system identifier.  Unlike WMS 1.1.1, the axis order is correctly specified to be 

latitude then longitude in WMS 1.3.0. 

 

The AUTO2 Label is for projected CRSs that specify a center of projection.   

 

The ―URL‖ identifier is “a fully-qualified URL that references a publicly-accessible file 

containing a definition of the CRS that is compliant with ISO 19111”. The TDS EC CRS 
Specification meets that requirement.  Unfortunately, WMS 1.3.0 is not yet in the DISR 
and so was not used for the NGA Plugweek. 

6.2.1.4 WFS 1.1.0 CRS Specification 

Section 9.2 Request of the WFS 1.1.0 specification (OGC 04-094) allows the following 

CRS options: 

Any valid URI value can be assigned to the srsName attribute. However, in order to 

enhance interoperability, a web feature service must be able to process srsName attribute 

values with the following ―format models‖:  

• EPSG:<EPSG code>  

• http://www.opengis.net/gml/srs/epsg.xml#<EPSG code>  

• urn:EPSG:geographicCRC:<epsg code>  

In these format models, the values <EPSG code> are placeholders for actual EPSG code 

values. Here is an example of the srsName where the assigned value follows one of the 

required format models: srsName="urn:EPSG:geographicCRS:63266405".  

No further guidance is provided on whether the format models apply only to CRSs 

specified by the EPSG, or whether the second format model allows any URLs, and the third 

format allows any URNs.  Note that EPSG:63266405 was a special specification for 

WGS84 created for OGC with axis order longitude then latitude. 

Section 13.3.3 FeatureTypeList section  Table 6 – Elements to Describe Feature Types, the 

entry for DefaultSRS states: 

The SRS may be indicated using either the European Petroleum Survey Group form 

'EPSG:<POSC Code>' or the URL format defined in subclause 4.3.2 of reference [2].

21 

 

Reference 2 is to the GML 3.1.1 specification.  As described below, theTDS EC CRS 
Specification meets its requrements. 

Section 14.3.3 Bounding Box states that ―The KVP encoding for a bounding box is defined in 
subclause 10.2.3 of normative reference [15]. ―  Reference 15 is to the OGC 04-016r3 draft of 

OWS Common.  As described below, the TDS EC CRS Specification meets these 
requirements. 

6.2.1.5 WCS 1.0.0 CRS Specification 

Section 8.3.4 Supported CRSs and coordinate reference systems of the WCS 1.0.0 

specification (OGC 05-076) states: 

CRS identifiers may be any of the EPSG:xyz, AUTO:xyz, or OGC:xyz coordinate systems 

defined in the Web Map Service Implementation Specification (OGC Doc. 01-0685r3); or the 

strings ―Engineering‖ or ―Image‖ to denote an ―engineering‖ or ―image‖ CRS, whose 

relationship to earth co-ordinates may not be well defined.  

The OGC document referent is interpreted here as a typographic error; it should be 01-

068r3 (WMS 1.1.1).  Unfortunately, there are no OGC:xyz coordinate systems defined in 

OGC 01-068r3. 

TDS EC CRS Specification does not meet these requirements.  

6.2.1.6 WCS 1.1.0 CRS Specification 

Section v. Revision History of the WCS 1.1.0 specification (OGC 06-083r8) states: 

WCS 1.1 introduces (only) the following functional changes: 

a) Use of GridCRS in coverage descriptions and requests 

(See 9.3.1.2, 10.2.1.1, 10.2.2, 10.3.4, 10.3.6, and Annexes G and H) 

Section 7.6.3 CRS references states: 

Clause 10.3 of OWS Common [OGC 05-008] specifies how CRSs shall be referenced.  

The TDS EC CRS Specification meets those requirements. 

6.2.1.7 CAT 1.0.1 CRS Specification 

Section 6.3.2 Core Queryable Properties of the CAT 1.0.1 specification (OGC 04-021r3) 

Table 1 – Common Queryable Elements definition for CRS is ―Coordinate Reference 

System (Authority and ID) for the BoundingBox" specified as type Identifier, with a 

footnote that "If not supplied, the BoundingBox CRS is a Geographic CRS with the 

Greenwich prime meridian".  Section 6.2.2 OGC_Common Catalog Query Language 

section provides BNF for identifier as follows: 

<identifier> ::= 

<identifier start [ { <colon> | <identifier part> }... ] 

<identifier start> ::= <simple Latin letter> 

<identifier part> ::= <simple Latin letter> | <digit> 

So this Identifier could be either a URL or a URN.  The TDS EC CRS Specification meets 
this requirement.

6.2.1.8 CAT 1.0.2 CRS Specification 

The CAT 1.0.2 specification (07-006r1) CRS Specification is the same as that for CAT 

version 1.0.1. The TDS EC CRS Specification meets its requirements. 

6.2.1.9 GML 3.1.1 CRS Specification 

The GML 3.1.1 specification (03-105r1) section 9.1.2.2 SRSReferenceGroup states: 

In general the attribute ―srsName‖ points to a CRS instance of 

gml:CoordinateReferenceSystemType (see coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd). For well-

known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI 

points to. 

No further normative guidance is provided, but all informative examples include srsName 
URN values like the following, which are not URLs that point to anything: 

srsName="urn:EPSG:geographicCRS:62836405" or 

srsName="urn:EPSG:geographicCRS:4326" 

The TDS EC CRS Specification refers to a GML coordinate reference system definition 

(gml:GeodeticCRS) on the web, so it meets these requirements. 

6.2.1.10 GML 3.2.1 CRS Specification 

The GML 3.2.1 specification (07-036) section 10.1.3.2 SRSReferenceGroup states: 

In general the attribute srsName points to a CRS instance of 

gml:AbstractCoordinateReferenceSystem (see 12.2.3). For well-known references it is not 

required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI points to.  

No further normative guidance is provided, but all informative examples include URN 
srsName values like the following, which are not URLs that point to anything: 

srsName="urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326" or 

srsName="urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326" 

The TDS EC CRS Specification refers to a GML coordinate reference system definition 

(gml:GeodeticCRS) on the web, so it meets these requirements. 

6.2.1.11 OWS Common 0.3.0 CRS Specification 

The draft OWS Common specification (04-016r3) section 10.3.2 URL References stated 

that URL references were to be to definitions that ―shall be encoded in XML, using one or 

more Application Schemas based on the CRS Schemas in Clause 12 of [GML 3.1]. ― 

(Coordinate Reference Systems).  This requirements of this specification are described here 

because it is nomratively referenced by the WFS 1.1.0 specification (OGC 04-094). 

The TDS EC CRS Specification refers to a GML coordinate reference system definition 

(gml:GeodeticCRS) on the web, so it meets these requirements.

6.2.1.12 OWS Common 1.0.0 CRS Specification  

The OWS Common 1.0.0 specification (05-008) states that URL references are to be to 

definitions that ―shall be encoded in XML, using one or more Application Schemas based 

on the CRS Schemas in Clause 12 of [GML 3.1]. ― (Coordinate Reference Systems). 

The TDS EC CRS Specification refers to a GML coordinate reference system definition 

(gml:GeodeticCRS) on the web, so it meets these requirements. 

In section 10.3.3 URN References, 05-008 states that ―For all XML attributes and elements 
with the anyURI data type, a URN value in the ―ogc‖ URN namespace can be used‖. 

6.2.1.13 Definition Identifier URNs in OGC Namespace Best Practice 

The Definition Identifier URNs in OGC Namespace OGC Best Practice (07-092r3) 

document clause 6.2 states: 

When using a XML attribute or element with the type anyURI to reference a CRS, CRS-

related, or other object, that URI shall have a value which uses one of two alternative URI 

formats:  

a)  Universal Resource Locator (URL), with standard form. The URL format should be 
used whenever the referenced definition is known to be electronically available using this 

standard URL 

.  

b) Universal Resource Name (URN), with a specified form. The URN format shall be 
used whenever the referenced definition is not, or might not be, available using a URL. 

This URN shall reference data that is specified by some ―authority‖ and is ―well-known‖ to 

both client and server software, including multiple clients and multiple servers.   

 

Document clause 7.2 provides an example: 

 

EXAMPLE The URN value urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326 shall mean the Coordinate 

Reference System (CRS) with code 4326 specified in version 6.6 of the EPSG database 

available at http://www.epsg.org/. That CRS specifies the axis order as Latitude followed 

by Longitude. 

 

The TDS EC CRS Specification refers to a GML coordinate reference system definition 

(gml:GeodeticCRS) on the web, so it meets the URL requirement, and should be supported 

by all future versions of OWS specifications. 

6.2.2 CRS Axis Order Issue 

Different OWS specifications and different versions of those specifications are silent on or 

contain different provisions for specifying the order of axes in a CRS as documented in the 

preceding section.  Unfortunately, some of those specifications mandated past common 

practices which ignored the axis order specified by the CRS definition, and reversed it, e.g. 

using EPSG:4326 with a longitude (X) then latitude (Y) axis order per computer graphics 

conventions despite the definition of EPSG:4326 axis order of latitude then longitude.

Geospatial Consortium 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

GML version 3.2.1 (07-036) added attributes to allow data providers to be explicit about 

the axis order specified by the CRS definition: 

The attributes uomLabels and axisLabels, defined in the gml:SRSInformationGroup 

attribute group, are optional additional and redundant information for a CRS to simplify the 

processing of the coordinate values when a more complete definition of the CRS is not 

needed. This information shall be the same as included in the complete definition of the 

CRS, referenced by the srsName attribute. When the srsName attribute is included, either 

both or neither of the axisLabels and uomLabels attributes shall be included. When the 

srsName attribute is omitted, both of these attributes shall be omitted.    

Unfortunately, those attributes are sometimes used incorrectly to indicate a different axis 

order than that specified by the CRS definition.   

Widespread adoption of future versions of OWS that follow the guidance of the OGC Axis 

Order Policy (08-038r5) should eventually eliminate this issue. 

6.2.3 Get Capabilities Service Identification Abstract and Keywords Issue 

The OWS Common specification defines a CapabilitiesBaseType in 

owsGetCapabilities.xsd that is the base for all OWS capabilities types.  It contains a 

<ows:ServiceIdentification> element containing <ows:Abstract> and <ows:Keywords> 

elements.  The existence and contents of these elements varied widely in 

GetCapabilitiesResponse documents returned from OWS servers supporting the NGA 

Plugweek.   Once harvested by a CSW, this inconsistency would hinder efforts to discover 

multiple OWS servers for the same data sets and themes. 

6.2.4 Styled Layer Issue 

Both WMS 1.1.1 and WMS 1.3.0 support portrayal of ―styled layers‖ using the LAYER 

and STYLES parameters to define pair-wise combinations of ―named layers‖ and ―named 

styles‖. A given WMS implementation must ―know‖ (be configured with) its layers and 

styles and these are advertised in the WMS capabilities document for clients to discover 

and use in subsequent GetMap requests. 

The Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) 1.1.0 specification (05-078r4) defines extensions to 

WMS 1.3.0 to enable support for ―user-defined layers‖ and ―user-defined styles‖, allowing 

map styling to be defined externally from a WMS implementation and shared from client-

to-client and WMS-to-WMS in an interoperable format. 

The Symbology Encoding (SE) 1.1.0 specification (05-077r4) defines an XML language 

for styling information that can be applied to Feature and Coverage data and is designed for 

reuse in multiple specifications beyond WMS. 

Together, SLD 1.1.0 and SE 1.1.0 replace the SLD 1.0.0 (02-070) specification. 

6.2.5 FeatureMember Property Namespace Issue 

One vendor‘s WFS returned features inside featureMember property elements 

(―tds:featureMember‖) in the application schema namespace instead of using 

―gml:featureMember‖ elements as children of the wfs:FeatureCollection element as 

specified for WFS 1.1.0 by OGC 04-094.   



OGC 09-140r2

A note in the SF-0 specification OGC 06-049r1 on page 13 says  

The only feature member container supported by this profile, for compliance level SF-0, 

shall be [prefix:]featureMember. Use of a feature container corresponding to 

gml:featureMembers in GML 3.1.1 is not allowed by this specification for compliance level 

SF-0.   

This is followed by an informative example on page 22 that includes a 

<wfs:FeatureCollection> with a <gml:featureMember> property.  That example conforms 

to the WFS 1.1 specification OGC 04-094, which defines a wfs:FeatureCollectionType 

based on a gml:AbstractFeatureCollectionType; the latter may have gml:featureMember 

child elements.  But the normative text of the SF-0 specification makes no exception for 

inclusion of GML Features conforming to SF-0 in a wfs:FeatureCollection.   

 

On the CITE page for WFS: http://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/docs/wfs/1.1.0/ there 

is a note:―GMLSF Levels 0 and 1 DO NOT support the use of feature collections through 

WFS interfaces.‖ 

 

Section vii of the SF-0 specification OGC 06-049r1 lists changes to WFS specification that 

are required to support SF-0.  For the GetFeatureOperation, the change is to the allowed 

values for the outputFormat subType: ―The WFS should respond by generating an instance 

document that validates against a schema document that complies with this profile.”  e.g. 
 

<ows:Value>text/xml; subType=gml/3.1.1/profiles/gmlsf/1.0.0/0</Value>  

<ows:Value>text/xml; subType=gml/3.1.1/profiles/gmlsf/1.0.0/1</Value>  

 

Section 8.4.2 defining feature collections ―shows how to define a feature collection in a 

GML application schema that complies with level SF-0 of this profile‖. 

 

The next revision of the WFS specification [17] has changed the definition of a 

wfs:FeatureCollection in Section 11.3.2 XMLEncoding to comply with SF-0. 

 

6.2.6 Client Specifications vs. Server Specifications Issue 

CITE tests exercise servers.  Some of the NSG Plugweek TIEs also tested client 

capabilities.  The user experience is heavily dependent on client capabilities.  One 

participant noted that there is much emphasis on server-side compliance and not enough 

emphasis on enabling a stack of essential client capabilities: view, discover, filter, analyze, 

etc.  

6.2.7 Reference Implementation Issue 

Several participants noted that the lack of online reference implementations for all OGC 

Web Service standards is a hindrance to commercial development of standard-conformant 

clients and servers.

6.2.8 Test Data Must Support Required Tests Issue 

The NSG Plugweek test data did not support a number of required tests.  All test data was 

WGS84, and requests were to be for WGS84, so WFS coordinate conversion capabilites 

could not be tested.  Test data attribute values were dummy values that did not vary among 

feature instances for any feature type, so WFS attribute queries could not be tested.  Test 

data was for one time instance, so temporal queries could not be tested.   

6.2.9 Character Case of HTTP Parameters and Values Issue 

There are character case inconsistencies in specifications across service types (WMS, WFS, 

WCS, CSW) and inconsistencies in implementation.  Several participants raised this issue  

In section 11.5.2 Capitalization the OGC Web Services Common Specification (06-121r3)  

states: 

The capitalization of parameter names when KVP encoded shall be case insensitive, meaning 

that parameter names may have mixed case or not.  

EXAMPLES The ―request‖ parameter name could be REQUEST, request, Request, or ReQuEsT.  

NOTE The XML capitalization is uniformly used in Clauses 7 through 10 plus Annex C of this document.  

The capitalization of parameter values when encoded using Keyword Value Pairs shall be as 

used in Clause 7 through 10 of this document. More generally, all value strings shall have the 

first word and any subsequent words in the name capitalized. All other letters will be lower 

case.  

EXAMPLE One possible ―request‖ parameter value is ―GetCapabilities‖.  

6.2.10 Server Behavior for Multiple Values for an HTTP Parameter Issue 

Some clients sent multiple values for a given request parameter, e.g. version.  Some servers 

use the first value, some use the last value and others concatenate the values and return an 

exception message because the value is invalid.  The OGC Web Services Common 

Specification (06-121r3) lists the multiplicity of parameters for requests, states that 

mandatory parameters must be implemented, that optional parameters should be 

implemented, and that implementation specifications may change the multiplicity of 

parameters, as needed.  But it does not explicitly state that variance from the specificed 

multiplicity is an exception. 

6.2.11 Server Behavior for Invalid Parameter Values Issue 

The OGC Web Services Common Specification (06-121r3) lists missingParameterValue 

and invalidParamterValue as exception codes in Table 25 on p44.  Unfortunately, some 

service implementations try to ―do the right thing‖, assume a default parameter value and 

return a ―good‖ response instead of returning an exception message in the face of a missing 

or invalid paramter value.  For example one WFS returned results when the value of the 

results parameter was ―foo‖.

6.2.12 Informative OWS Exception Messages Issue 

Many servers do not include text in <ows:Exception> elements in exception reports.  It can 

be hard to figure out what is wrong based solely on the exception code and locator value in 

an <ows:Exception>.  In Table 23 Parameters in Exception Element of the OGC Web 

Services Common Specification (06-121r3), the Multiplicity And Use value for 

ExceptionText is optional, and ―Omitted only when no more useful information available ‖.  But 

it is often omitted when more useful information is available.   

This may be because in the same table, the value for Data Type and Value is ―Character 
String type, not empty.  Value is exception description as defined by individual servers.‖  This 

clause may be interpreted to mean that an OWS implementation with no exception descriptions 

does not have to provide any exception text. 

6.2.13 Informative CITE Exception Messages Issue 

It can be hard to figure out what is wrong.  For example, the CITE readiness test does not 

say why the test fails when it fails.

Several participants said it was unclear why some test cases exist or what they‘re 

specifically intended to test. Providing rationale for these cases would help developers and 

testers understand what and how to implement.  This may have been a side-effect of the 

decision to focus on services and schemas instead of use cases [3]. 

 LockFeature  
o optional in OGC spec, NSG says mandatory 
o There was considerable skepticism among participants that this is a required 

operation, as the need for it depends on the capabilities of the underlying 

implementation. Some vendors need it, others don‘t. Why make it mandatory?  

Is there a NSG use-case or CONOP that requires feature locking? 

 Listing supported/allowed operations is inconsistently implemented/supported 
o Ability to list allowed operations per feature type in the capabilities document 

may not be uniformly supported by clients.

to some controversy as to whether the GML data for plugweek was valid, as it allowed 

instance documents to be approved by validating XML/Schema parsers, when they would 

have failed validation had the gmlsf.xsd schema been imported instead.  The instance 

document that passed validation and caused controversey had a <tds:geometry> element 

that included a <gml:CompositeCurve> element.  This is valid in full GML version 3.1.1, 

but not in SF-0.  The tds:geometry elemet is defined in the NGA schemas as a 

gml:CurvePropertyType, which contains a <gml:_Curve> element, or any element in its 

substitution group.  In SF-0 and the gmlsf.xsd schema, the only allowed elements in the 

gml:_Curve substitution group are gml:Curve and gml:LineString, whereas the full GML 

version 3.1.1 geometry schemas also include gml:Composite curve in the gml:_Curve 

substitution group.

6.3.1.5 CSW 2.0.1 

There was no NSG Profile for CSW 2.0.1.  See OGC Specification results in section 6.3.1.5 

below. 

6.3.2 Recommendations 

6.3.2.1 Transition from WMS 1.1.1 to WMS 1.3.0 as soon as WMS 1.3.0 is in the 
DISR 

WMS 1.3.0 supports the use of the TDS EC CRS Specification, whereas WMS 1.1.1 does 

not.  This transition will also help to resolve the CRS Axis Order issue discussed above. It 

will also avoid the GetFeatureInfo assumed INFO_FORMAT value issue discussed below. 

6.3.2.2 Transition from SLD 1.0 to  SLD 1.1.0 and SE 1.1.0 as soon as they are in the 
DISR 

Transitioning to WMS 1.3.0 and SLD 1.1.0 (and SE 1.1.0) will provide a more capable and 

interoperable means to dynamically style layers according to the user‘s preferences, role, 

and mission. The SLD 1.1.0 specification depends on (extends) WMS 1.3.0 and references 

SE 1.1.0.  



OGC 09-140r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, IncCopyright © 2010 Open 
Geospatial Consortium 

35 

 

The recommendation here is to transition to the WMS 1.3.0, SLD 1.1.0, and SE 1.1.0 

specifications at the same time. 

6.3.2.3 Transition from WCS 1.0.0 to WCS 1.1.0 as soon as 1.1.0 is in the DISR 

WCS 1.1.0 supports the use of the TDS EC SRS Specification, whereas WCS 1.0.0 does 

not. 

6.3.2.4 Add explanatory note to TDS DCS EC [11] in section 5.3.3 as line “c” 

―Note: Per SF-O specification, the TDS GML application schemas import gml.xsd.  

Validation of instance documents against these schemas with a validating XML parser 

checks conformance to full GML, not SF-0.  Validation of instance documents to check 

conformance with SF-0 can be accomplished by replacing the import of gml.xsd with 

gmlsf.xsd in TDS GML application schemas.‖ 

6.3.2.5 Use gml:identifier in GML version 3.2.1 TDS Application schemas 

TDS Application schemas for GML versions 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 define 

tds:uniqueEntityIdentifier.  There is no unique identifier type in GML 3.1.1, but GML 3.2.1 

specifies use of gml:identifier for this purpose.  It should be used if possible in GML 

version 3.2.1 application schemas, e.g. if backwards compatibility with version 3.1.1 data 

sets is not required. 

6.3.2.6 NSG Profile should be prepared for OWS Common 

The Get Capabilities Service Identification Abstract and Keywords Issue is an indicator that 

NGA should consider profiling OWS Common in addition to various OWS specifications.  

If this is done, the NSG Common profile should add some mandatory service level 

keywords, and make the service level abstract mandatory. 

6.3.2.7 Transition from WFS 1.1.0 to ISO 19142 (WFS 2.0) as soon as 19142 is in the 
DISR 

WFS 2.0 (ISO 19142) will correctly support SF-0 whereas WFS 1.1.0 does not.  

6.3.2.8 Prepare NSG Requirements for OWS Clients  

The NGA should prepare a document listing requirements for OWS clients. 

Previous OWS Testbeds have investigated requirements for OWS Clients.   These results 

are documented in two OGC Engineering Reports 

 OWS Integrated Client (GeoDSS Client), OGC Document 05-116 
 Integrated Client for Multiple OGC-compliant Services, OGC Document 03-021 

6.3.2.9 Prepare NSG Requirements for OWS Test Data  

The NGA should prepare a document listing requirements for test data structure and 

content for each future OWS activities and create test data that meets the stated 

requirements so that the test data supports all of the tests planned for the activity.

6.3.2.10 Prepare NSG requirements for CSW 

The NGA should prepare a document listing the NSG requirements for CSW.  It should 

address capabilities like the following: 

 Core queries for resource discovery using the CSW Dublin Core properties or 
DDMS 

 Query/resolve associations between resources (e.g., find services associated with a 
layer or dataset) 

 Association management (create, maintain, resolve, validate/fix) 

 Semantic/taxonomic searches and mappings 
 

 

6.4 OGC Specifications 

6.4.1 Findings 

6.4.1.1 WMS 1.1.1 

6.4.1.1.1 OGC Specification CITE Tests 

Two out of three server vendors passed the WMS 1.1.1 OGC CITE Tests.  The third server 

vendor only failed to provide styling for point features. 

6.4.1.1.2 TIE Results 

See the NSG Profile TIE Results above. 

6.4.1.1.3 GetFeatureInfo response 

During the Plugweek, one WMS client issued a GetFeatureInfo request for the same feature 

to three WMS servers.  One responded in XML, the second responded in HTML, and the 

third responded in GML. 

The WMS 1.1.1 Specification is ambiguous regarding what a WMS server should do if no 

optional INFO_FORMAT parameter is included with a GetFeatureInfo request.  No 

mechanism for specifying a default value for the INFO_FORMAT parameter is provided.  

And clause 7.3.4 GetFeatureInfo Response says ―The WMS shall return a response 

according to the requested INFO_FORMAT if the request is valid, or issue an exception 

otherwise.‖  This could be interpreted to mean that the WFS server should not assume a 

default value for INFO_FORMAT, but issue an exception if it is not included in a request. 

The  INFO_FORMAT parameter was made mandatory in WMS 1.3.0. 

6.4.1.2 WFS-1.1.0 

6.4.1.2.1 OGC Specification CITE Tests 

One vendor passed the WFS 1.1.0 OGC CITE Tests; others encountered problem #347 with 

the test itself.

6.4.1.2.2 TIE Results 

See the NSG Profile TIE Results above. 

 Filter operations are inconsistently advertised 
 

6.4.1.3 GML and SF-0 

6.4.1.3.1 GML Simple Features Specification Outdated 

The SF-0 specification is based on GML 3.1.1.  SF-0 has not been normatively brought 

forward to profile GML 3.2.1.   

6.4.1.3.2 GML Simple Features Schema Imports Full GML Schema 

As discussed above in section 6.2.1.3, the SF-0 specification notes the compliance level and 

references the SF-0 schema gmlsf.xsd, but imports the full GML 3.1.1 schema gml.xsd 

instead.  The SF-0 editor recalls that this was done to avoid a general XML parser caching 

issue that can affect any XML schema and profiles thereof that share the same namespace.  

Here is the scenario: 

1. Both gml.xsd and any profile of gml (like gmlsf.xsd) use the same gml namespace (i.e. 
http://www.opengis.net/gml).  

2. XML parsers typically cache schemas based on their namespace. (e.g. Oracle XML 
parser does this, so does XML-Spy)  

3. A user validates an application schema uthat imports gmlsf.xsd. The xml parser caches 
gmlsf.xsd using the gml namespace as the key.  

4. The user then validates an application schema that imports gml.xsd, the schema for full 
GML.   

5. However, since the namespace is the same, the xml parser assumes that its cached copy 
of the schema is OK and uses that. The second validation fails because the application 

schema that imported gml.xsd includes elements from full GML that gmlsf.xsd does 

not.  

Because this is a general parser problem, for the gml namespace it affects all profiles of 

GML, not just GML Simple Features.  

6.4.1.3.3 Enumeration Implementation in Schema or Dictionary Issue 

Section E.2.4.8 UML Classes (code lists) in the GML 3.1.1 specification (03-105r1) 

documents the use of XML Schema enumerations in GML, and states ―Alternatively, 

gml:Dictionaries can be used to represent code lists.‖  Using a gml:Dictionary document to 

hold enumeration values instead of an XML Schema enumeration in a GML Application 

Schema has several potential advantages.  It makes the schema smaller, so it can be parsed 

faster.  It can be changed without requiring a version number change in the schema.  But a 

dictionary of enumerations would need to be versioned just like a schema, so this just 

moves the problem rather than solving it.  Although internationalization was cited by 

several participants as an advantage or an external dictionary, an XML Schema is also an

XML document, so the xml:lang attribute may be use in it as well.  The XML 

recommendation states: ―A special attribute named xml:lang may be inserted in 

documents to specify the language used in the contents and attribute values of any element 

in an XML document.―   A disadvantage of using a gml:Dictionary instead of an XML 

Schema enumeration is that it prevents a validating XML parser from checking the values 

in an instance document against the enumerated values.

servers. 

 

Issues with CONOPS, use-cases, and test cases: What functionality is mandatory? Knowing 

this would help drive whether ebRIM is required.  

 

6.4.1.5.3 Catalog Harvest Specification Issue 

A service gets registered differently in different catalogs.  The result is that clients can 

never reliably query any given catalogue. This is the case whether the catalogs harvest 

WMS, WFS and WCS services directly, or harvest other CSW servers to obtain 

information about the WMS, WFS and WCS services they have harvested.  See the NSG 

Profile TIE Results above.  An OGC ER addressed this issue 6 years ago [16].  One 

problem appears to be the lack of common mappings between the CAT specifications‘ core 

queryables and returnables and the GetCapabilitiesResponses of services being harvested, 

which was addressed for a much earlier version of the CAT specification in OGC 03-041 

[16]. Another problem appers to be the lack of common mappings between the CAT 

specifications‘ core queryables and returnables and elements of the metadata models used 

in catalog profiles.   The CAT ISO Metadata Application Profile (OGC 07-045) provides a 

mapping to ISO 19115 metadata model elements that is lacking for other metadata models. 

6.4.1.6 Catalog Query Parameter Value Namespace Qualification 

When the types of queried object are part of an inheritence hierarchy and the query element 

specification is not namespace qualified, the desired object is ambiguous.  For example, 

wrs:ExtrinsicObject is in the XML Schema substitution group for rim:ExtrinsicObject.  

Which should be retured to a query for ―ExtrinsicObject‖? 

6.4.2 Recommendations 

6.4.2.1 Adopt documented best practices for CRS definitions 

All subsequent versions of OGC specifications must support use of URN CRS definitions 

according to the guidance of 07-092r3.  

6.4.2.2 WMS 1.3.0 Change Request

<gml:featureMember> property to an example that conforms with SF-0 normative 

requirements. 

6.4.2.4 GML Change Request 

Ask the GML SWG to reconsider the mechanism whereby profile schemas such as 

gmlsf.xsd are referenced but not imported, as this practice avoids situational XML Schema 

parser caching problems at the expense of universal inability to correctly validate SF-0  

instance documents or those using other GML profiles. 

6.4.2.5 SF-0 Version Upgrade Request 

Request the formation of a Working Group to revise the GML Simple Features 

specification to profile GML version 3.2.1.  Ask the working group to reconsider the 

mechanism whereby gmlsf.xsd is referenced but not imported, as this practice avoids 

situational XML Schema parser caching problems at the expense of universal inability to 

correctly validate SF-0 instance documents. 

6.4.2.6 Catalog Harvest Specification Recommendation 

Further work needs to be done on mapping of CAT core queryables and returnables to both 

OWS GetCapabilitesResponse documents, and to CAT profile metadata models, 

particularly those for ebRIM.   There are currently two in play; the CSW-ebRIM profile of 

CAT and the ebRIM/ebRIM v4.0 catalog from OASIS which is being extended for spatial 

within OGC.  

6.4.2.7 OWS Client Capabilities Recommendation 

Prepare an OGC Recommendation Paper listing desirable OWS client capabilities.   

 Include capabilities to handle data where the axis order has been switched from that 
defined in the specified CRS.  

For WFS, 

 Include capabilities to display all supported operations for each feature type.

address the following exception handling issues.  These changes will help standardize error 
reporting and the error message text returned by service implementations. 

 Explicitly specify that variance from the specified multiplicity of any request parameter 
is an invalid operation request to which the service should return an exception report.  A 

new ―InvalidParameterMultiplicity‖ exception code should be added to Table 25 

Standard Exception Codes and Meanings for such exceptions, for all variances other

than that coverd by the existing missingParameterValue exception code.  The locator 

value for this exception code is the name of the parameter.  The ExceptionText for this 

exception is ―X paramter values expected, Y values found: Z‖ where X is a string value 

containing the expected multiplicity range, Y is the number of parameters in the 

request, and Z is a comma separated list of the parameter values in the request. 

 

 Change the Data Type and Value value for ExceptionText in Table 23 Parameters in 
Exception Element from ―Character String type, not empty.  Value is exception description 

as defined by individual servers.‖ to ―Character String type, not empty.  Value is 

ExceptionText from Table 25 for common exception codes, or ExceptionText defined 

by OWS specification for OWS service-specific exception codes ‗c‘.‖  Add a footnote 

‗c‘: ―The contents and meaning of this parameter shall be defined for each allowed 

exceptionCode value. For some exceptionCode values, the meaning may be different 

for different operations.  This exception text should be included whenever meaningful 

information can be provided by the server.‖  Change the Multiplicity and Use value for 

ExceptionText in Table 23 Parameters in Exception Element from ―Zero or more 

(optional)‘a‘ Omitted only when no more useful information available.‖ to ―Zero or more 

(optional)‘a‘ Omitted only when no ExceptionText is specified for the ExceptionCode.‖

6.5.2.2 Implement Request Parameter Multiplicity Tests 

Test the multiplicity of all OWS request parameters against the multiplicity stated in the 

specifications.  Services pass this test if they provide a meaningful exception report when 

the multiplicity of the provided parameters is at variance with the specifications. 

6.5.2.3 Improve Test Failure Messages 

 Add ―show failure details‖ option that specifies detailed error messages are to be 
returned for test failures 

 Add ―show request response‖ option that specifies HTTP request and response text 
are to be included in test failure error messages to support debugging 

6.5.2.4 Improving OWS Specifications will improve CITE tests 

The Specification Model — A Standard for Modular specifications (OGC 08-131r3) 

specifies desirable characteristics of a standards specification that will encourage 

implementations by minimizing difficulty determining requirements, mimicking 

implementation structure and maximizing usability and interoperability.  Future versions of  

OGC Standards are moving to implement the policy defined in this document.  OGC 

Standards written to adhere to O8-131r3 will have clearer definition of requirements.  

Clearer definition of the requirements will result in better compliance tests.   

6.5.2.5 OWS Exemplar Implementation Recommendation 

The OGC should establish exemplar implementations for all OWS standards to facilitate 

commercial development of OWS-conformant servers and clients.  Exemplar 

implementations are active, online and publically accessible Reference Implementations 

that  provide authoritative TIE partners for OWS clients under development, and a means 

for developers to see what an authoritative service does as apposed to what the standard 

says it should do, in cases where the wording of the standard is ambiguous and subject to 

different interpretations.   

The current approach for CITE Reference Implementations is for them to be open source to 

allow developers to understand how the implementation meets the specification.  

Development of open source Reference Implementations is done as a part of OWS 

TEstbeds based upon sponsorship.    As the development of Reference Implementations for 

all OWS standards is a resource issue for the OGC, it could establish a new policy of 

holding competitions for designation of commercial products as exemplar implementations, 

whereby the winner gets an ―exemplar implementation‖ gold star in the online listing of 

conformant products in exchange for the expense of establishing the exemplar 

implementation and keeping it online. 

 

6.6 IE/Plugweek Process  

6.6.1 Findings 

 Test datasets didn‘t support testing the specifications and NSG profiles. 
o Many test conditions were not observable because of the test data 



OGC 09-140r2

o The lack of realistic values for feature properties prevented testing queries 
and generating views, etc. 

 Many test conditions were not observable because of client shortcomings. 

 Detailed CITE results were not logged. 

 Some CITE tests that failed due to errors in the tests were not repeated after the tests 
were fixed at the end of the plugweek. 

 TIE coverage was incomplete; some clients did not test against all available servers. 

 TIE results reporting was incomplete; no details were provided for tests that were 
not observable via client interfaces; few request and response values were provided 

for failed tests. 

 Regarding WFS tests, several participants said it was unclear why some test cases 
exist or what they‘re specifically intended to test. Providing rationale for these cases 

would help developers and testers understand what and how to implement.  This 

may have been a side-effect of the decision to focus on services and schemas 

instead of use cases [3]. 

 Considerable time and effort were expended discovering the issues that are 
documented in this ER which became interoperability hurdles, establishing private 

conventions to work around specification version incompatabilities, and modifying 

server and client code and configuration settings. 

 Once interoperability hurdles were surmounted, an OWS client could ―plug-and-
play‖ with the OWS services, and exercise most of their capabilities. 

 

6.6.2 Recommendations 

6.6.2.1 Revise Plugfest Policies and Procedures  

The OGC Plugfest Policies and Procedures should be revised to address the following 

issues. 

 Thorough planning and preparation is key to IE / Plugweek activity success 

 If CITE testing is part of the activity 
o Arrange for CITE test issue resolution support. 
o Specify which CITE tests, conformance levels, and options to use 

 Tests and TIEs to be performed must be completely specified 
o OWS and/or profiles thereof 
o Capabilities,  operations, sub-operations, and options 
o Expected results and exceptions 

 Test request and response values and any other data to be gathered to document results 
must be completely specified 

 Results reporting mechanisms must be established 

 The test environment configuration must be specified and publicized 

 Test datasets must be prepared to support all intended tests.  Document the 
requirements for test data structure and content based on test and TIE specifications and 

create test data that meets the stated requirements so that the test data supports all of the 

tests planned for the activity.

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 

 Test workflows must be established for all participants to assure complete test coverage 
including repeating tests that failed due to interoperability hurdles once the problems 

have been resolved. 

 General HTTP GET and POST clients must be available to perform tests that 
commercial OWS clients cannot perform. 

 

6.6.2.2 Find Sponsors for OWS Testing Tools 

The labor expense of conducting OGC testing activities for OWS could be significantly 

reduced and the quality of the ER documentation created could be significantly improved 

by the use of appropriate HTTP test infrastructure tools.   Two tools are suggested for 

sponsor support via funding, in-kind contribution, or open source development.  The log 

output of both tools should be XML documents that conform to the same XML Schema, to 

facilitate conversion of test results to report document fragments via XSLT stylesheets. 

 General HTTP GET and POST client that logs request and response values and HTTP 
headers and times service delivery 

 HTTP TestWall Servlet intermediary that serves as a 2-way proxy for commercial OWS 
clients and servers and that logs request and response values and HTTP headers and 

times service delivery
