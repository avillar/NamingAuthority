7. Annex B Rationale: Sensor Simulation - Achieving Device-
Independence 

Formerly Annex A10 in Volume 2 

One of the primary objectives of the CDB Standard is to provide and integrate all of the 
data required by all sensor devices, not just Image Generators producing the Out the 
Window (OTW) scenes.  The purpose of this integration, among other things, is to 
achieve and maintain a high level of correlation among the many client-devices 
(subsystems) within a simulator.  Furthermore, this integration must be done 
independently of the client-device or the sensor type, with little or no duplication of data 
amongst clients.  In addition to the OTW, many simulator client-devices are required to 
simulate the synthetic environment over different portions of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, infrared (e.g. FLIR, NVG), microwaves (e.g. radar), audio (e.g. sonar), etc.  Up 
to now, the current state of the art approaches to the simulation of sensors has typically 
been quite proprietary to the client-device implementation of the various vendors.  There 
have been no universally accepted simulation models suitable for use in simulation. 
Sensor simulation typically requires a simulation of the device itself, supplemented by a 
complete simulation of the synthetic environment over the portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum that is relevant to this device.  The former simulation is referred to as the 
Sensor Simulation Model (SSM) while the latter is called the Sensor Environmental 
Model (SEM).  In the past, the SEM relied heavily on environmental databases whose 
content was designed to match the functionality, fidelity, structure and format 
requirements of the SEM.  The level of realism possible by the SEM depended heavily 
on the quality, quantity and completeness of the data available.  The environmental 
database was highly device-specific and could not be readily ported to other platforms. 
A SEM is usually based on mathematical model of the environment for the portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum of interest.  The SEM acts much as a black box that produces a 
response in accordance to input data.  A significant portion of this data must come from 
the CDB; however, the key is to segregate all device-dependent data and all SEM-
dependent data from the modeling data that represents the synthetic environment.  In 
order to accommodate the most different kind of sensors possible, a common 
denominator must be chosen.  In the CDB standard, this common denominator is called a 
material.  This is the subject of this annex. 
One of the fundamental issues of sensor simulation involves the handling of material 
properties.  As discussed earlier, the determination of which material properties should be 
supported heavily depends on: 

a) the sensor types to be supported; 



 

11 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

b) the vendors’ sensor simulation implementations to be supported; and 
c) the level of fidelity, functionality and precision of the SEMs to be supported. 

 
Clearly, the task of determining a definitive list of material properties that would 
accommodate all of the above requirements for the today’s sensor types, vendor 
implementations and SEMs would be a significant challenge.  Furthermore, once 
released, the materials properties would limit any SEM innovation by the industry.  As a 
result, the CDB Standard limits its jurisdiction over the material properties. 
Instead, the CDB standard defines and publicly defines a list of materials that can be used 
in a CDB.  It is the responsibility of each vendor to define the properties (that satisfies the 
sensor type) for these CDB materials.  As a result, vendors are totally free to select 
material properties that satisfy the fidelity, functionality and precision requirements of the 
SEM for the sensor type of interest.  Alternately, if the vendors have their own list of 
materials, they can create a mapping between CDB materials and their internally 
supported list of materials.  This approach allows client-devices to retain their SEMs as 
well as their own sets of material properties. 
The materials.xsd and materials.xml schema in the CDB schema package enumerates the 
base materials supported by this standard.

8. Annex C: Reasons for Using Jpeg 

(Formerly from body of Best Practice Volume 1) 

The CDB Standard prescribes the use of an industry standard compression algorithm for 
its storage intensive raster imagery datasets.  This not only provides a substantial 
reduction in storage, but also reduces the data transmission bandwidths associated with 
simulator’s access to the synthetic environment database at runtime.  As a result of its 
storage efficiency, the CDB Standard relies on relatively few data formats for storing its 
datasets. There is no benefit (other than storage efficiency) to be gained in supporting any 
other specialized data formats whose underlying objective is only for storage efficiency.  
The CDB Standard embodies the JPEG 2000 industry standard format for raster imagery 
because it has comparable storage efficiency to all of these image formats without 
sacrificing any generality.  JPEG 2000 has been chosen by the CDB Standard as a format 
for the storage of OTW raster imagery because of the following characteristics. 

1. High compression efficiency: Compression better than 0.25 bits per pixels.  
Virtually indiscernible loss in image quality for 10:1 – 20:1 compression. 

2. Lossless and lossy compression: Lossless compression ratios approx. 1.7:1 

3. Perceptual color space internal coding: Allow dark images to be reconstructed 
without banding artifacts. 

4. High dynamic range: Compress and decompress images with various dynamic 
ranges (e.g., 1-bit to 16-bit) for each color component. 

5. Large images sizes: Up to (2^32 - 1)  

There are other characteristics of the JPEG 2000 that are worth mentioning but are not 
directly beneficial to the CDB Standard.  Those are: 

1. Progressive image reconstruction: Allow images to be reconstructed with 
increasing pixel accuracy and resolution. 

2. Region of interest coding: Permits certain Region of Interest (ROI’s) in the image 
to be coded and transmitted with better quality and less distortion than the rest of the 
image. 

3. Seamless quality and resolution scalability: Without having to download the 
entire file 

4. Error resilience during transfers. 

JPEG 2000 will be solely targeted at Raster Imagery data only.  The reason is simply 
because of its highly efficient compression scheme that fits well with the goal of reducing

the huge datasets associated with Imagery.  Other raster-based datasets defined in the 
CDB will solely be using the TIFF format due to their more manageable size.

9. Annex F Rationale: Partitioning the Earth into Tiles 

Formerly Appendix A11 in Volume 2 of the CDB Best Practice. 
This section provides rationale for partitioning the world into tiles. 
The design of the CDB standard tile representation is centered on three primary 
considerations. 

(1) A tile representation comprehensive enough to accommodate the entire 
earth. 

(2) A tile representation that lends itself to real-time implementation by a 
CDB system and all of its attached simulator client-devices. 
A numerically straightforward mapping (such as a simple scaling) to map 
lat-long coordinates into CDB coordinates and vice versa is highly 
desirable for real-time implementation considerations. 

(3) A tile representation with a system of units that conforms as much as 
possible to geographic standards. 
One of the underlying motivations driving the CDB tile representation is 
the need for a system that will remain as close to the raw source data as 
possible which currently is DTED and GeoTIFF; DTED uses a geographic 
coordinate system defined by latitudes and longitudes.  The basic unit in 
DTED is a geo-cell, which always has a height and width of one degree.  
In order to maintain a density of data that does not increase inordinately 
when moving towards the poles, the grid post intervals (measured in 
degrees or arc-sec) along the longitudinal axis are increased at specific 
latitudes; for instance, at DTED level 2, the latitude interval is always one 
second of arc but the longitude interval is one second of arc at latitudes 
from 0 to 50 degrees, from latitudes 50 to 70 the interval is two arc 
seconds and so on as shown in Table A-3.  INTERVALS FOR DTED 
LEVEL 2.

V 80 – 90 N-S 1 6 

 
Before going into the detailed design of the CDB tile representation, it is worth stating 
the guiding principles that constrain the approach used by the CDB tile representation. 

 
(1) The earth model is divided (in latitude) into slices. 
(2) The slice’s x-axis is aligned to WGS-84 lines of latitude. 
(3) The slice’s y-axis is aligned to WGS-84 lines of longitude. 
(4) The number of units along the slice’s y-axis for a given level of detail is 

the same for all slices. 
The earth surface geodetic dimension in arc-second of y-axis units within 
an earth slice and in all earth slices is exactly the same, regardless of 
latitude. 

(5) The geodetic dimension of an x-axis unit in arc-second is constant within a 
zone, but is re-defined at pre-selected latitudes to achieve a greater level of 
spatial sampling uniformity in all tiles; this overcomes the narrowing 
effect of increased latitudes on longitudinal distances.  The definition of 
zones in the CDB is the same as those in DTED (with the exception of the 
poles). 

(6) The number of units along the slice’s x-axis for a given level of detail is 
the same within each zone. 

(7) The number of units along the slice’s y-axis is constrained to a 2n-multiple 
in all slices. 
Many simulator client devices impose constraints related to the run-time 
use of binary pyramidal structures (such as mip-maps, quadtrees, etc.).  A 
binary pyramidal structure is simply a collection of two-dimensional 
arrays; each array represents the same content but at successively finer 
levels of resolution. 

(8) The number of units along the slice’s x-axis will vary depending on which 
zone the latitude of the slice belongs.  At this point we introduce the 



 

16 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

concept of a CDB Geocell, which differs slightly from a DTED Geocell.  
A DTED cell is always 1 × 1 degrees.  In contrast, a CDBGeocell always 
has a height of 1 degree but has a varying width depending on its latitude.  
Table A-4.  Size of CDB Geocell per zone shows the dimensions of a 
CDB Geocell per zones of latitude.  For instance, in latitude zone 5, which 
goes from –50 to 50 degrees latitude, a CDB Geocell is 1 × 1 degree, in 
zone 4 and 6 which goes from latitude 50 to 70 degrees the cell size is 1 × 
2 degrees.  The main reason to introduce this concept is to maintain a 
reasonable eccentricity between the sides by trying to keep them as close 
to a square as possible.  Two criteria are used to define the size of a CDB 
Geocell. 

 
(a) A CDB Geocell must contain a whole number of DTED Geocells; 

in other words a CDB Geocell must start and end on a whole 
degree along the longitudinal axis.  This is done so as to facilitate 
mapping from CDB Geocells to DTED Geocells. 

(b) The length of the CDB Geocell must be a whole factor of 180, in 
other words length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 degrees are legal but 
lengths of 7 and 8 degrees would not be since these are not exact 
factors of 180.

9 +80 ≤ lat < +89 1 x 6 6 
10 +89 ≤ lat < +90 1 x 12 12 

 
The variable CDB Geocell size in the CDB standard has the following benefits. 



 

17 

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

 
1. Reduces the simulator client processing overheads associated with the switching 

from one zone to another.  (Due to the small number of zones across the earth.) 
2. Reduces the variation of longitudinal dimensions (in meters) to a maximum of 

50%. 
3. Improves storage efficiency.

10. Annex G Rationale: Importance of Level of Detail 

Formerly Appendix A-12 of Volume 2 of the OGC CDB Best Practice. 

The availability of LODs for most datasets is critical for real-time performance.  Many 
simulator client-devices can readily take advantage of an LOD structure because many 
clients naturally require less detail with increasing distance away from the simulated own 
ship position.  For example, the projection of screen pixels (i.e. pixels in an IG image 
plane) onto near-field terrain subtends much less area than the projection of screen pixel 
onto far-field terrain near the horizon; as a result, much less detail is required at far range.  
In addition, clients may need to revert to an alternate coarser representation if they cannot 
cope with the paging bandwidths, memory footprint or computational requirements of 
finer LODs.  This provides a solid basis on which client-devices can build paging 
managers, load management and memory management algorithms. 
The following example illustrates the important performance considerations and the 
inherent performance advantage that can be achieved with an LOD structure.  Consider a 
simulator client-device, with a capability to display terrain imagery out to 128 km; the 
imagery is 1m at its finest available resolution and the simulated ownship is flying at 100 
m/s.  Under these conditions, and without the benefit of an LOD organization (as 
illustrated in Figure A-15: Paging of Terrain Imagery without an LOD Structure), the 
client-device would require access to the imagery at a rate of ~100 Mpixels/sec.  
Consider on the other hand the same operating conditions but with the client-device 
accessing LOD-organized imagery (as illustrated in Figure A-14: Paging of Terrain 
Imagery with an LOD Structure).  Furthermore, assume that the client-device only 
requires 1m imagery for ranges less than 1/2 km, 2m for ranges less than 1km, 4m for 
ranges less than 2km, and so on.  With the benefit of an LOD structure, the client-device 
would require access to the imagery at a much lower rate of ~1 Mpixels/sec, reducing 
access bandwidth by a factor of ~100x over the non-LOD approach.  Clearly, such 
performance gains cannot be ignored for real-time applications such as flight simulators, 
especially when one realizes that access bandwidth increases as the square of the imagery 
resolution. 
In addition to a reduction in access bandwidth, the LOD structure also benefits simulator 
client-devices that have a requirement to dynamically filter the data to control aliasing.  
In effect, part of the client-device filtering process is relegated to an off-line process. 
The CDB standard does not enforce, nor does it specify the type of filter used to compute 
the data element values of raster-organized or list-organized datasets.  Yet, it is clear that 
inadequate off-line filter may affect the rendering quality of the affected client-devices.  
As a result, the CDB standard provides guidelines to govern the quality of the off-line

LOD process; these guidelines are provided with each of the raster-organized dataset (or 
list-organized datasets in future releases of the CDB standard).

11. Annex H Informative: JPEG 

Formerly Appendix A.17 in Volume 2 of the OGC CDB Best Practice 
The CDB standard supports JPEG2000 for both VSTI and VSTLM component data. 
As a result of the high rates of compression there are no real advantages to be gained in 
supporting a broad range of alternate color representations (such as single channel 
representations, indexed color representations, RGB-triplet color encoding such as 5-6-5, 
etc.).  The underlying motivation behind all such schemes is driven by a desire to reduce 
storage and transmission bandwidths.  JPEG-2000 achieves these goals and many others, 
refer to Table A-8 JPEG 2000 Features. 

 
Table A-8 JPEG 2000 Features 

High compression efficiency:	
Compression better than 0.25 bits per pixels, 

20% compression efficiency improvement over 
JPEG.	

High dynamic range:	
Compress images with various 

dynamic ranges (e.g. 1-16 bit) for each 
color component.	

Lossless and lossy compression: 
Lossless compression ratios approx. 1.7:1. 

Seamless quality / resolution 
scalability: 
Without having to download the entire 
file. 

Progressive image reconstruction: 
Allows images to be reconstructed with 
increasing pixel accuracy and resolution. 

Large images sizes - up to (232 - 1). 

Perceptual color space internal coding. Single decompression architecture. 
Region of interest coding: 
Permits certain ROI’s in the image to be coded 
and transmitted with better quality and less 
distortion than the rest of the image. 

Error resilience during transfers.

12. Annex I Informative: ZipFile Format Notes 

Formerly Annex U in Volume 2 of the OGC CDB Best Practice 

The archive zip format used in the CDB standard is based on 
APPNOTE.TXT - .ZIP File Format Specification 
URL: http://www.pkware.com/documents/APPNOTE/APPNOTE-6.3.1.TXT 
Version: 6.3.1 
Revised: April 11, 2007 
Copyright (c) 1989 - 2007 PKWARE Inc., All Rights Reserved. 
The use of certain technological aspects disclosed in the 
currentAPPNOTE is available pursuant to the below section 
entitled "Incorporating PKWARE Proprietary Technology into Your 
Product". 

 
CDB zip compliant reader is required to support as a minimum the following features 
defined in APPNOTE.TXT: 

• Local file header (Note: Extra field can be inserted but not required to be read) 
• File data 
• Data descriptor: 
• Central directory structure (Note: Digital signature is supported but will not be 

read) 
• End of central directory record: (Note: ZIP file comments are supported but will 

not be read) 
 

The compression methods supported: 

• No compression 
• Deflate (Enhanced Deflate is not required to be supported) 

 
The following features are not required to be supported thus are optional and left to the 
implementation: 

• Archive decryption header 
• Archive extra data record. 
• Zip64 end of central directory record 
• Zip64 end of central directory locator 
• Splitting and Spanning ZIP files

14. Annex M: CDB Directory Naming and Structure 

Formerly Appendix M, Volume 2 of the OGC CDB Best Practice 

With CDB version 3.2 (prior to the submission into the OGC), Appendix M was used to 
present the complete list of names allowed to construct the directories of the CDB. As of 
version 3.2 (as submitted into the OGC standards process), the appendix has been 
replaced by a combination of folder hierarchy and metadata files and controlled 
vocabularies delivered with the CDB Distribution Package. 

The /CDB folder hierarchy provides a complete list of directory and file name patterns of 
the CDB; it summarizes the structure of the CDB presented in chapter 3, Volume 1: Core. 
The following files are necessary to expand the patterns: 

• /CDB/Metadata/Feature_Data_Dictionary.xml provides the list of directory names 
associated with feature codes; 

• /CDB/Metadata/Moving_Model_Codes.xml provides the list of names for DIS 
Entity Kinds, Domains, and Categories; and 

• /CDB/Metadata/DIS_Country_Codes.xml contains the list of DIS Country 
Names. 

 

Together, these files provide all the information required to build the names of all 
directories permitted by the CDB standard.

• Texture Kind 004 will expand as new colors are added.  Color names 
are defined here: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Colors. 

• Texture Kind 005, the Camouflage Paint Scheme, follows a similar 
numbering scheme as the HLA’s RPR-FOM Version 2 Draft 17.  The 
list will expand as new camouflages are needed or new values added to 
the RPR-FOM. 

• Texture Kind 006 will expand as ICAO assigns new airline acronyms. 

• Texture Kind 054 and 055 will expand as new contaminants and skid 
marks are deemed necessary.

17. Annex R: Derived Datasets within the CDB 
By using Industry Standards throughout this document, the CDB Standard defines the 
means and mechanisms to populate all the simulation datasets without involving data 
duplication.  However, there are situations where a specific dataset information type 
needs to be derived from another existing one in order to specialize further the 
information into another dataset type or form. 

This consideration becomes a grey area where the off-line tools’ capability and the run-
time simulation clients’ performance levels enforces this data derivation. 

It is such a case with the Mip-Map data, Min-Max Elevation data, Tile Presence data, 
RCS data, and Raster Material data for example.

In order to produce the various Level Of Details 
within the Elevation Dataset, it is often necessary 
to over-sample or sub-sample a primary set of 
data values.  Since those values within the LOD 
hierarchy may come from a single data source, 
the LODs can be seen as derived information 
which can better accommodate the client needs 
based on their performance level.

For clients that need to compute line of sights 
(LOS) between simulation entities spread across 
a vast terrain area, it is imperative to have a fast 
way of knowing the minimum and maximum 
elevations within a tile without loading the entire 
elevation data grid. The min/max elevation 
dataset can be used to ensure a fast pre-
determination of entities occultation state with 
the terrain. The min/max data is stored in the 
form of a quad-tree pyramid and is based on the 
area covered at the given depth level of the quad-
tree. For example, for the maximum dataset the 
top will contain the maximum for the whole of 
the geocell, the next pyramid level contains 
maximum data for each the quarter geocells and 
so on. Similarly for the minimum the top 
represents the minimum for the whole of the 
geocell going down as for maximums. Currently 
the pyramid size is fixed and goes down to level 
9 which covers areas that are approximately 
256x256 meters square; note that the depth level

can be modified to a finer or coarser level but 
level 9 is suggested as a reasonable compromise 
of performance vs. storage. A tool will pre-
determine the minimum and maximum 
elevations within a geocell’s elevations and 
generate the quad-trees described previously; 
note that the tool will use all of the elevation data 
that is present in the elevation dataset to 
determine the maximums or minimums in a 
given area. The tool will provide Min-Max 
values to client devices through the Min-Max 
Elevation datasets in the CDB.

The Max Culture Height data is produced for 
clients that need to compute line of sights (LOS) 
between simulation entities spread across a vast 
terrain area that take into account the maximum 
cultural feature heights. The dataset helps rapidly 
assess an intersection status of line-of-sight with 
cultural features.  This dataset is derived from the 
Vector Datasets of the CDB for corresponding 
tiles. The storage is done via a quad-tree similar 
to that of the min/max elevation the top of the 
pyramid represents the height of the highest 
cultural feature in the dataset going down to a 
suggested depth level of 9.

3D Model 
(GT, GS,

The polar diagram data (covering all aspect 
angles) of the RCS dataset for Geotypical, 
Geospecific or Moving Models cannot readily be 
computed at run-time due to the complex 
mathematical computing algorithms and 
resources required to determine the Electro-
Magnetic Energy absorption levels by the 
model’s materials, the corner reflections, the 
multi-path reflections, EM parameters 
(frequency, polarization) effects, and so on.  
Therefore, off-line COTS tools are used to 
analyze the 3D model geometry and its materials 
in order to produce the RCS dataset specifically 
for different frequencies and polarizations.

18. Annex S: Default Read and Write values for Simulator Client-
Devices 

As seen throughout this document, the CDB standard provides guidelines with respect to 
default values in cases where no data could be read from the CDB for requested datasets.  
Those default parameters are captured in a Metadata file within the CDB.  The Table 
below summarizes all the Default Parameters Names and the suggested initial values to 
be used by client-devices.  In cases where the default parameter would be missing 
altogether from \CDB\Metadata\Defaults.xml, Client-Devices shall use the “Default 
Value” found in the fourth column.  A “Read” default refers to the value being assumed 
while reading the CDB data.  A “Write” default refers to the value being written to the 
file when content-generation tools have partial source data.
