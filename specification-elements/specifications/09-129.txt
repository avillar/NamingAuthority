AIP-2 Use Cases  
1. Introduction 

1.1 Scope of this document 
This AIP-2 Engineering Report (ER) describes a set of transverse technology Use Cases developed and applied in 
the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot Phase 2 (AIP-2).  Such Use Cases define reusable activities within a 
service-oriented architecture, tailored for the GEOSS environment.  This report contains the general Use Cases that 
were specialized by community Working Groups to implement several specific Societal Benefit Area (SBA) 
Scenarios in AIP-2.  The SBA Scenarios and specialized use cases are defined in separate AIP-2 ERs. This AIP-2 
ER will be offered for consideration by the GEOSS Best Practice Registry editors and to OGC Technical Committee 
for consideration as a Best Practice. 
 

1.2 GEOSS AIP 
The GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot (AIP) leads the incorporation of contributed components consistent 
with the GEOSS Architecture using a GEO Web Portal and a Clearinghouse search facility to access services 
through GEOSS Interoperability Arrangements in support of the GEOSS Societal Benefit Areas.  AIP is a GEO task 
for elaborating the GEOSS Architecture under the purview of the GEO Architecture and Data Committee.   

This Engineering Report (ER) is a key result of the second phase of AIP.  AIP-2 was conducted from July 2008 to 
June 2009.  A separate AIP-2 ER describes the overall process and results of AIP-2 and thereby provides a context 
for this ER.1   

1.3 Organization of this document 
The following section introduces the role of the transverse technology use cases in GEOSS and how they support the 
reusable process described in the AIP-2 Summary Report ER. Section 3 describes the five categories of use cases 
developed and exercised in AIP-2, in addition to the system actors and the use case template. Section 4 highlights 
successful examples of using and specializing the use cases in AIP-2 and lists a mapping of the use cases to the 
GEOSS Common Infrastructure and Community Components as used in the AIP-2 scenarios. Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 
9 describe the individual registration and harvesting, clients and portals, deployment and access, service testing and 
workflow use cases respectively.  

2. Role of the Transverse Technology Use Cases in GEOSS 
As with the Internet, GEOSS is envisioned as a global and flexible network of content and service providers 
enabling decision makers to discover, access and integrate an extraordinary range of earth observing related 
information within their applications. To achieve this vision, the GEOSS architecture must provide an easy and 
reusable process to leverage the GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI) and components in support of many SBA 
communities. The AIP defined and piloted such a process for using and augmenting the GEOSS Common 
Infrastructure to meet SBA community needs. The process applies a system modeling methodology based on 
international standards tailored specifically to the GEOSS environment.  
 
The reusable process is based on implementing community-defined scenarios using transverse technology use cases. 
The community scenarios are narrative descriptions of SBA community needs with minimal discussion of the 
implementation architecture. Community scenarios serve to provide an end user view of the value of GEOSS to 
specific community needs. The transverse technology use cases, on the other hand, describe reusable functionality of 
the GEOSS service oriented architecture implemented through Interoperability Arrangements.  
 
This document describes in detail the ten generalized use cases identified in AIP-2. Each generalized use case 
encompasses a unit of useful functionality and describes a set of actions performed by various system actors in

support of one or more actors or other stakeholders interacting with the system. Within AIP-2, several generalized 
use cases were refined and/or specialized as needed to meet specific SBA scenario requirements. The individual 
SBA ERs describe how the generalized use cases were used, refined and/or specialized.  
 
The next section presents the categories and general descriptions of the generalized use cases as well as identifies 
the system actors participating in the use cases. Representative instances on how the use cases were 
refined/specialized in the AIP-2 community scenarios are presented in Section 4.    

3. Use Cases Overview 

3.1 Categories and General Descriptions 
In AIP-2, the transverse technology use cases supporting the community scenarios were grouped in five categories, 
as shown in Figure 1. The grouping of the use cases was based on supporting the end-to-end GEOSS process from 
resource deployment (02), registration (01) and harvesting (03) to discovery (04), access (05, 06) and exploitation 
(07) of resources enabled by infrastructure-support functionality such as workflow construction/processing (08), 
service testing (09) and interoperability arrangements management (10).  
 
The development of each category of use cases was lead by an AIP-2 transverse technology working group in a 
collaborative and iterative process.  The development of each category was coordinated across technology working 
groups to maintain the integrity of the end-to-end process with participation from AIP-2 community working groups 
to ensure alignment with GEOSS SBA community needs.

Table 1 Actors in GEOSS Transverse Technology Use Cases 

Some actors were further defined in community scenarios to better represent those actors within the specific 
communities. For instance, the GEOSS user was represented by 

- Air quality managers/analysts/forecasters/modelers in the Air Quality AIP-2 community scenario 
- Investors/electricity producers/consulting companies/academic/research organizations in the Renewable 

Energy AIP-2 community scenario 
- Scientists in the Climate Change & Biodiversity AIP-2 community scenarios 

 
Similarly, the specific Client Application actor varied in the different scenarios as follows: 
 

AIP-2 Community Scenario Client Application 
Air Quality ESRI GeoPortal 
Renewable Energy Renewable Energy Community Portal 
Pika Distribution (CC & Biodiversity) IP2 Client Application 
Polar Ecosystems (CC & Biodiversity) Arctic community portal 
Disaster Management and Response GeoPortals, SIREN Disaster Response Portal, ERDAS Titan

4. Application of the Use Cases in AIP-2 
Although developed specifically for leveraging the GEOSS Common Infrastructure and Community Components, 
the Transverse Technology Use Cases as defined and used in AIP-2 have been designed to remain general enough to 
be applicable for the wide range of SBAs and community scenarios. With this level of generality, it is expected that 
various use cases would require further refinement and/or specialization when used in specific scenarios, as 
experienced in AIP-2.  
 
The refinement and/or specialization can take many forms, such as: 
 

- When a community refines or further defines the use case actors for their community (as discussed earlier) 
- When a community specializes a use case based on the specific technology or architectural 

needs/constraints of their scenario (as when the community elaborates on the generic Access use case to 
describe the steps for accessing specific types of services used in the community, such as Sensor Services 
or Web Coverage Services. Another example is when a community elaborates on the use of Web 
Accessible Folders as their primary community catalog representation) 

- When a community refines a use case to better define the types of resources used in a scenario (as in 
specifying the types of air quality data/services needed for a particular scenario)  

 
The above list can easily be infinite given the breadth and reach of GEOSS combined with the varying needs and 
advancements of the different SBAs. To help with future applications of the use cases described in this document, 
this section highlights some of the specialization instances developed in AIP-2 and maps the use cases to the 
GEOSS Common Infrastructure and Community Components as used in the AIP-2 scenarios.  

4.1 Use Case Specialization Instances in AIP-2 
The following table represents successful examples of specializing some of the use cases described in this document. 
This table is not a comprehensive listing of all the specialization instances encountered in AIP-2. For more

information about each instance, the reader is referred to the specific Community Working Group ERs.  
 
General Use Case Specialization Instance 
Register resources - Portlet was registered as reusable resource in Renewable Energy scenario 

 
Deploy resources - JSR 168 portlet was deployed as reusable resource that can be integrated in 

conformant portal framework/container in Renewable Energy scenario 
- A specialized use case for deploying a netCDF-CF WCS was developed to 
support the AIP-2 testing phases (managed by the Air Quality Community 
WG) 

Harvest & Query  - Air Quality scenario and Renewable Energy scenario both used a Web 
Accessible Folder that was successfully harvested by the GEOSS 
Clearinghouse(s) 

Search for resources - The Floods Disaster Response scenario involved searching for specific RSS 
feeds as well as searching for resources in the ESA EO Clearinghouse (in 
addition to the GEOSS Clearinghouse) 
- The Pika distribution scenario introduced a brokering and mediation 
component that performed the search for resources on behalf of the Client 
Application 

Present results - The Floods Disaster Response scenario experimented with presentation of 
alerts (e.g. potential floods CAP alerts) 
- The Pika distribution scenario used the brokering and mediation component 
to prepare the presentation of results to the client 

Interact with services - The Renewable Energy scenario required interaction with WMS serving 
offering GeoTIFF outputs 
- The Floods Disaster Response scenario required interaction with WCS/SOS 
services as well as advertising SAS from a sensor node event/alert and 
configuring SAS with thresholds

5. Registration and Harvesting Use Cases 

5.1 Register Resources 
This use case describes the conditions and steps to register resources in the GEOSS Components and Services 
Registry (CSR) or in (registered) Community Catalogs. This use case is a pre-condition to the discovery and 
harvesting of resources through GEOSS Clearinghouses.  

 
Overview 

Title Register resources in GEOSS Components and Services Registry (CSR) or 
Community Catalog 

Description This use cases covers making information about a GEOSS resource known to the 
GEOSS community, and “findable” through a GEOSS Clearinghouse, by either 
registering the resource directly with the GEOSS CSR or registering a community 
catalog/metadata service in which the resource has already been registered.  

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# Service Provider 

# GEOSS Components and Services Registry (CSR) 

# Community Catalog Provider 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

#  Service Provider has deployed an online resource of interest to GEOSS. For 
example:  a data access service, a catalog, a model, an observation service or 
process (grid transformation or workflow). 

# Service Provider has registered their organization in the GEOSS CSR. 

# (Recommended) Community Catalog (incl. Web Accessible Folder) Provider has 
made their service available for resource description registration. 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: Service Provider chooses between three alternatives: 

         1. Determine the appropriate component and service types to describe the resource and register those 
directly in the CSR. 

         2. Determine the appropriate component and service type for a metadata service / resource they have 
deployed and register that service in the CSR in lieu of registering individual resources directly. 

         3. Register their resource in a community catalog that has already been registered (possibly by another 
organization) in the CSR. 

For Alternatives 1&2: 

Step 2: Service Provider chooses a component type and registers the component corresponding to their 
resource in the CSR. 

Step 3: Service provider determines that metadata about their resource appropriate to the service type(s) it 
represents is available through one or more Web links. 

Step 4:  Service provider chooses one or more service types to represent their resource and registers them 
with appropriate metadata links and update logistics. 

Step 5: Service Provider, when registering a resource with the CSR, can associate the standards and 
interoperability arrangements used with the resource. See Register Interoperability Arrangement Use Case.

5.2 Register New Interoperability Arrangements  
This use case describes the steps for adding references to standards or special interoperability arrangements in the 
GEOSS Standards and Interoperability Registry (SIR). This use case is jointly developed with the GEOSS Standards 
and Interoperability Forum (SIF).  
 

Overview 

Title Register, in the GEOSS Standards and Interoperability Registry (SIR), new and 
recommended interoperability arrangements) as well as utilized standards. 

Description This use case covers the action of closing the loop on interoperability practices and 
arrangements (standard and otherwise) that have been implemented for GEOSS. 
The arrangements are registered and moderated in the SIR both to provide more 
information on what has been implemented, and to provide other GEOSS 
participants with an arrangement choice for registering their own resources. 

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# Service Provider 

# GEOSS Components and Services Registry (CSR) 

# GEOSS Standards and Interoperability Registry (SIR) 

# SIF (Standards and Interoperability Forum) Moderator 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

#  Service Provider has deployed an online resource of interest to GEOSS. For 
example:  a data access service, a catalog, a model, an observation service or 
process (grid transformation or workflow). 

# Service Provider may have registered their resource to the GEOSS Components 
and Services Registry or to a community catalog / metadata service which is itself 
registered with GEOSS. 

# Service Provider wishes to register, for wider recognition and re-use, a particular 
interoperability arrangement that is implemented by their resource. 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: Service Provider develops or locates a description or specification of the chosen interoperability 
arrangement. 

Step 2: Service Provider publishes the new document to a Web accessible location or obtains an online link 
to an existing document. 

Step 3: If the Service Provider is registering the service with the CSR, continue with Step 5. 

Step 4: If the Service Provider is registering the interoperability arrangement with the SIR, continue with 
Step 6. 

Step 5: Service Provider logs in, registering if necessary, at the CSR.  While registering the service, Service 
Provider will request to also register the interoperability arrangement, which will result in the SIR entry 
form being made available at the CSR.  Continue with Step 7. 

Step 6: Service Provider logs in, registering if necessary, at the SIR.   

Step 7: Service Provider will choose to submit a new interoperability arrangement, providing: 

              1.  Name (concise version of official title) 

              2.  Version

Step 10: If SIF does not approve submission, Service Provider will be contacted. 

Step 11: DONE. 

Post Condition 

A new interoperability arrangement is available in the GEOSS SIR for all GEOSS participants.  If it was 
registered via service registration it will be referenced by the Service Provider's service registration record.  
If it was registered at the SIR, then Service Provider will need to update the service record at the CSR to 
reflect its association with the registered interoperability arrangement. 

Alternative Flow(s) 

Alternative Step 7:  Service Provider registers the interoperability arrangement at the SIR 

7a. CSR obtains an updated list of GEOSS SIR entries. 
7b.  Service Provider registers or updates their service at the CSR. 
7c.  Service Provider chooses the new interoperability arrangement from the SIR entries within the GEOSS 
CSR client in order to properly characterize their resource. 
7d.  Continue with Step 11. 
 
Alternative Step 10:  Service Provider is contacted by SIF to discussion interoperability arrangement 
submitted.  
10a. SIF works with the Service Provider to refine the interoperability arrangement and its documentation or 
to choose a better alternative arrangement. 
10b. Service Provider submits updated interoperability arrangement.  
10c. Continue with Step 8.

5.3 Harvest & Query via Clearinghouse 
This use case describes the steps for harvesting and/or querying service or content metadata from community 
catalogs or services via a Clearinghouse.  
 

Overview 

Title Harvest and Query Metadata via GEOSS Clearinghouse 

Description This use case describes the steps for harvesting and/or querying service or content 
metadata from community catalogs or services via a GEOSS Clearinghouse.  

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# Service Provider 

# GEOSS Common Infrastructure Registry 

# GEOSS Clearinghouse 

# Client Application 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

# Service Provider has deployed an online resource of interest to GEOSS. For 
example:  a data access service, a catalog, a model, an observation service or a 
process (grid transformation or workflow) or information resource. The resource 
may also be a service client (online browser client generator or downloadable 
software component). 

# Service Provider has published online resource description metadata by 
registering their service either with the GEOSS CSR "or" in a metadata service (e.g. 
Community Catalog, Web Accessible Folder) which in turn has been registered in 
the GEOSS CSR. 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: GEOSS Clearinghouse queries GEOSS CSR for registered components and services. 

Step 2: GEOSS Clearinghouse extracts from the CSR response the harvest policies and online metadata 
service links for CSR registered resources. 

Step 3: For resources that are metadata services or provided metadata links, GEOSS Clearinghouse harvests 
all or part of the available metadata holdings (recommended). 

1. The community catalog permits harvesting and holds less than 10000 records. GEOSS Clearinghouse 
harvests all of the holdings and periodically updates them according to the registered frequency of change. 

2. The community catalog / metadata service does not permit bulk harvesting and/or holds more than 
10000 records. GEOSS Clearinghouse harvests collection records (aggregate summary) as criteria for 
dynamically cascading queries to the Clearinghouse from users to the service 

Step 4: For resources that are other than metadata services, GEOSS Clearinghouse harvests the service 
getCapabilities or equivalent resource description and any additional metadata references provided therein. 
The Clearinghouse assembles as complete as possible a set of discovery metadata records from this 
information according to its familiarity with that particular service type. 

Step 5 (Optional): Service Provider issues a manual request to GEOSS Clearinghouse to re-harvest and 
update metadata sooner than indicated by its registered harvest policy. 

Post Condition 

The GEOSS Clearinghouse is prepared to accept and process resource discovery queries from Client 
Applications.

6. Clients and Portals Use Cases 

6.1 Search for Resources  
This use case describes the conditions and steps for portals and application clients to support the GEOSS user in 
searching for resources of interest via the GEOSS Clearinghouses or Community Catalogs. This use case is a pre-
condition to the Present Reachable Services and Alerts use case.  

 
Overview 

Title Search for Resources via GEOSS Clearinghouse(s) or Community Catalog(s) 

Description This use case describes the conditions and steps for portals and application clients to 
support the GEOSS user in searching for resources of interest via the GEOSS 
Clearinghouse(s) or Community Catalog(s).  

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# GEOSS User 

# Client Application (GEO Portal,  Community Portal, Desktop Application, 
Portlet, etc) 

# GEOSS Clearinghouse 

# Community Catalog 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

# GEOSS User is looking for information of value to task at hand 

# Client Application has been developed and is available for use 

# Resources’ metadata has been successfully harvested in GEOSS Clearinghouses 
(either directly or via registration in a Community Catalog) 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: Client Application requests capabilities of catalogs of interest (GEOSS Clearinghouse and/or 
Community Catalogs) to determine the protocol needed to search for resources (e.g CSW 2.0.2 or Z39.50) 
and the queryable elements of each as needed. Alternatively, the Client Application knows a-priori the 
protocol needed to interact with catalog(s)/clearinghouse(s) of interest 

Step 2: Client Application presents GEOSS User with search criteria based on queryable properties of 
selected catalogs 

- Simple keyword search and area of interest/bbox search 

- Advanced search parameters such as organization, catalogs to be searched, societal benefit 
areas, resource type, etc 

- More specific earth-observation criteria such as sensor row/path, collection, subsetting/ordering 
and/or delivery mechanisms, etc 

- Value-added and/or domain/community specific search capabilities such as thesaurus matching, 
cluster matching, etc 

Step 3: Based on user selections, Client Application constructs query to each selected catalog and the 
ResultSet is returned and presented to the user with application-specific options (such as total number of 
results, basic information about each result, grouping of results, etc) 

Step 4:  GEOSS User selects resources of interest for evaluation and/or use.  

Post Condition 

The Client Application has retrieved the necessary metadata to present the GEOSS User with information

the service offerings such as layers, features, coverages, sensor parameters, portrayal rules, etc served by 
the selected service 

Step 3: The GEOSS User can choose to get additional information about each offering (if available via 
DescribeFeature, DescribeCoverage, DescribeSensor, etc) 

For Alert Services  

Step 1: The GEOSS User is presented with subscription options (e.g. frequency of alerts, geographic 
extent, etc) 

Step 2: The GEOSS User can choose subscription options 

Step 4: After selection of resources, Client provides options for downloading/exploring resources (files, 
documents, websites), displaying alerts, viewing resources in the case of OGC Web Services, and/or 
parameterizing and executing workflows.

7. Deployment and Access Use Cases 

7.1 Deploy Resources 
This use case describes the conditions and steps to configure and deploy a component with associated service 
interfaces, in order to make a resource accessible and usable within GEOSS. This use case is a precondition to the 
Interact with Services Use Case. 
 

Overview 

Title Deploy Resources for use in GEOSS 

Description This use case identifies many of the aspects that are, or should be, common to all or 
multiple Web Services interface Implementation Specifications. It refers notably to 
the OGC Web Services Common document, OGC Web Map Service (WMS), Web 
Feature Service (WFS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS), but shall encompass as 
well OpenDAP and W3C W*S. Web Services common aspects include: service 
operation request and response encoding; and parameters included in operation 
requests and responses.  

This use case also deals with best practices for readying the service for registration 
in the GEOSS CSR, ensuring proper service discovery, retrieval, and testing by the 
GEOSS communities of practice. 

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# GEOSS Service Provider 

# GEOSS Components and Services Registry (CSR) 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

#  GEOSS Service Provider has a resource of interest for GEOSS. For example: a 
model, an observation or another process (grid transformation, workflow...) 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: Service Provider identifies then implements the best available Web Service standard (OGC, 
W3C...) to make its resource available on GEOSS (based on best practices for that type of data, plus 
availability and familiarity of software tools) 

Step 2: Service Provider configures or validates all the information about its Service interface as provided 
in the service Capabilities document: 

- Service Type, Version, Title and Abstract, Supported Languages 

- Contact information (service provider POC) 

- Supported service operations request and response encodings 

- Contents: layer names and titles 

- Domains of validity (dimensions, units, range, scales, reference systems) 

Step 3: Service Provider is ready to register the Component and associated Service interfaces to the GEOSS 
CSR (as described in the Register Resources Use Case). Metadata about the service (ISO 19139) is 
generated automatically from the service. Often, additional information (e.g. metadata not found in the 
getCapabilities) also needs to be added  

Post Condition 

# The following information about a Service is available for registration (ideally, each piece of information 
is associated with a Uniform Resource Identifier URI) 

- Service getCapabilities URL

7.2 Interact with Services 
This use case describes the conditions and steps to interact with a Service Instance within GEOSS. This use case can 
be specialized to support a variety of GEOSS services and resources such as Sensor Planning Service, Ordering 
Service, Models, Sensor Observation Service, WCS over netCDF, WMS Cascading, WFS Simple, CAP Alerts 
atompub Service, etc.  
 

Overview 

Title Interact with Services 

Description This use case describes many of the aspects that are common to OGC Web Services 
(WFS, SOS, WCS, WMS). These common aspects are primarily some of the 
parameters and data structures used in operation requests and responses. 

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# GEOSS Service Provider 

# Client Application (GEO Portal, Community Portal, desktop application, etc) 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

# The server is deployed and configured for serving data according to some 
standardized dataset schemas and some data encodings. 

# A GetCapabilities operation has been performed by a client application to retrieve 
metadata about the service operations and the resources provided by the server 
(OWSContents). 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: Service receives a Describe(resource) request 

Step 2: Services sends a response describing the content offerings of each queried resource 

Step 3: Service receives a Get(resource) request with parameters set by the client from the content offerings 
response  

Step 4: Service sends a response with the resource content matching the selected content offering  

Post Condition 

# The following information from a Service interaction must be available  

- Service title, keywords, typeVersion, fees, accessConstraints, providerName & contactInfo, 
requestMethods, exceptionHandlingMethods 

- Resources names, keywords, CRS & boundingBox, metadata links, supported languages

8. Service Testing Use Cases 
The Service Testing Use Cases describe the conditions and steps to test services for conformance and quality of 
service. Such testing may occur before or after services are registered. The use case assumes that the future Service 
Provider has developed a service following the appropriate interoperability arrangements and has made the service 
accessible through a URL. More information on Service Testing is available in the GEOSS AIP-2 Testing 
Engineering Report.  
 

Overview 

Title Test Services 

Description Service Provider tests its service using a proper Test tool discovered in the GEOSS 
CSR.  

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# GEOSS Service Provider 

# GEOSS CSR 

# Test Facility/Tool  

# GEOSS Relevant Standards Authority 

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

# The Test Facility shall be registered in GEOSS and shall be available 

# The Service Provider shall make available the Service to be tested through a URL 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: Service Provider puts the Service to be tested on a reachable and available server 

Step 2: Service Provider accesses the GEOSS CSR to search for a Test Facility/Tool matching the type of 
Service to be tested (e.g. WMS Service) 

Step 3: Service Provider browses the search results and checks the details of registered Test 
Facilities/Tools. Optionally, the Service Provider can access the instructions on how to use Test 
Facilities/Tools of interest 

Step 4: Service Provider selects and accesses a Test Facility/Tool and if necessary (and/or not previously 
done), the Service Provider registers in the Test Environment as a Service Provider 

Step 5: Service Provider logs into the Test Environment 

Step 6: For a WMS, the Service Provider fills the WMS form for the GetCapabilities request, providing the 
URL of the service to be tested and the other necessary parameters 

Step 7: The Test Tool sends an XML GetCapabilities request to the service to be tested and receives back 
an XML response 

Step 8: The Test Tool performs the testing and providers results to the Service Provider  

Step 9:  In case of problems (e.g. immature or emerging interoperability arrangement), the Service Provider 
has the option of providing feedback to the Test Facility Provider. The Test Facility Provider can provide 
feedback to the relevant GEOSS Standards Authorities after further analysis 

Post Condition 

# The following information about a test must be available  

- Results of the test (received by the Service Provider) 

- Issues on the usage of the Test Facility/Tool

9. Workflow Use Cases 
The workflow use cases describe the conditions and steps to configure and deploy workflows, consisting of one or 
more services. Detailed information on configuring, constructing, deploying and using workflows is available in the 
GEOSS AIP-2 Workflow and Processing Engineering Report. For the case of BEL, the Engineering Report includes 
information about two designing approaches: one for the concrete BPEL workflow that can be designed using 
standard BPEL designer such as the Oracle BPEL designer; and one for the abstract model which can be instantiated 
through an instantiation service to create the workflow on the fly.  
 

Overview 

Title Construct and Deploy Workflow 

Description This use case aims at capturing the alternative approaches to design, deploy and 
execute a workflow. The workflow can be described in Business Execution 
Language (BPEL), Sensor Markup Language (SensorML), or any other script 
language.  

Actors and 
Interfaces 

# GEOSS Integrator 

# Client Application 

# Service Provider  

Initial Status and 
Preconditions 

# Data: data or observations from sensors are available in rudimentary format and 
projection. Further processing is required to generate useful information for 
decision-makers 

# Algorithms: Algorithms are available as geospatial Web Processing Processes that 
can be re-used in different workflows 

# Web Services: Web Services to be used in the workflow are available and 
compliant with GEOSS interoperability arrangements 

Basic Flow 

Step 1: GEOSS Integrator designs the Web Processing Service using a BPEL designer. The workflow can 
embed the steps to inject the results into standard, persistent storage services through their transaction 
capabilities (e.g. WCS-T or WFS-T) 

Step 2: GEOSS Integrator deploys the workflow into a BPEL engine. The workflow can be registered as a 
GEOSS resource following the Use Case Register Resources 

Step 3: Client Application executes the workflow via the Web Processing Service interface 

Post Condition 

# Data is served through geospatial web services using GEOSS interoperability arrangements 

# A composite service (or workflow) is available as a Web Processing Service and can be executed
