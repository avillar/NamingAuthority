Executive Summary 
This document defines specific DGIWG requirements, recommendations and guidelines for 
implementations of the ISO / OGC Web Map Service standard which is based on ISO 
19128:2005 Web Map Server Interface / OpenGIS Web Map Server Implementation 
Specification 1.3.0. 
 
ISO 19128: 2005 defines a Web Map Service as: 
"A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data dynamically from 
geographic information. This International Standard defines a “map” to be a portrayal of 
geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a computer screen. A 
map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally rendered in a pictorial format 
such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based graphical elements in Scalable 
Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats." 
 
Previous versions of the WMS standard have not been considered in this profile. 
 
The WMS Interface offers 3 Operations: 

 GetCapabilities (mandatory): Allows for obtaining Service Metadata 
 GetMap (mandatory): Returns a map 
 GetFeatureInfo (optional): Provides additional information about features in the 
pictures of maps that were returned by previous GetMap requests 

The WMS Implementation Specification defines two conformance classes, “Basic WMS” and 
“Queryable WMS”. The Basic WMS supports the mandatory GetCapabilities and GetMap 
operations (requests and responses) whereas the Queryable WMS supports all Basic WMS 
operations and the GetFeatureInfo operation. The DGIWG WMS profile mandates the 
implementation of the Queryable WMS. 
 
Software implementations that claim to be conformant with the DGIWG WMS profile shall 
support all mandatory operations, parameters and elements of the base standard, as well 
as the specifically defined requirements in this document.  
 
The DGIWG WMS profile references the different operations and parameters of the base 
standard and subsequently defines specific DGIWG requirements and 
recommendations for software implementations to foster interoperability and use in the 
military domain.

iii. Future work 
A revision of WMS 1.3 is currently undertaken at the OGC. The revision will produce a version 
1.4. WMS standard. This DGIWG WMS profile will be updated accordingly. Currently the WMS 
2.0 Standards Working Group is working off several Change Requests including support for 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoded GetFeatureInfo responses. This profile will be 
updated to the new base standard version as requirements dictate.

1. Introduction 
This document defines specific DGIWG requirements, recommendations and guidelines for 
implementations of the ISO / OGC Web Map Service standard which is based on ISO 
19128:2005 Web Map Server Interface / OpenGIS Web Map Server Implementation 
Specification 1.3.0. 

A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data dynamically from 
geographic information. 

The OGC WMS Interface offers 3 Operations: 

 GetCapabilities (mandatory): Allows for obtaining Service Metadata 

 GetMap (mandatory): Returns a map 

 GetFeatureInfo (optional): Provides additional information about features in the pictures of 
maps that were returned by previous GetMap requests 

The WMS Implementation Specification defines two conformance classes, “Basic WMS” and 
“Queryable WMS”.  

The Basic WMS supports the mandatory GetCapabilities and GetMap operations (requests and 
responses) whereas the Queryable WMS supports all Basic WMS operations and the 
GetFeatureInfo operation. 

Software implementations that claim to be conformant with the DGIWG WMS profile shall 
support the Queryable WMS, as well as the specifically defined requirements in this 
document.  

The DGIWG WMS profile is written in such a way that it references the different operations and 
parameters of the base standard and then defines specific requirements for software 
implementation.

6. DGIWG WMS Profile (normative) 

6.1. Introduction 
A WMS that complies with the DGIWG WMS profile will  
a) satisfy all requirements stipulated in the OGC WMS 1.3.0 Specification; 
b) satisfy all requirements stipulated in this document. 

This profile provides advice on the implementation of the WMS so that tests can be 
provided to ensure objective compliance to the profile. The profile provides a “Normative 
Clause” to describe how each component shall be implemented. The Normative Clause 
defines requirements where mandatory compliance is required for attainment of 
conformance. However, the profile also includes optional Recommendations which may 
require a subjective test. 
 
The following syntax is used to indicate the compliance requirement within the profile: 

 Mandatory (M) – The requirement shall be implemented 

 Conditional (C) – Mandatory when “If” statement applies 

 Optional (O) – Should be implemented 

Note: All Requirements and Recommendations presented within this document are the 
result of information gathered during the DGIWG Nations questionnaire/survey process. 
Implementers should be aware that certain requirements are unique to a national profile 
such as the metadata requirements for the US shall include conformance with the NSG 
Metadata Framework while the DGIWG requires conformance with the DGIWG 
Metadata Framework. These two metadata profiles have been synchronized to the 
fullest extent possible.      

 

6.2. Normative Requirements

6.4. Service Type 
The OGC WMS Implementation Specification defines two conformance classes, “Basic 
WMS” and “Queryable WMS”. A Basic WMS supports the GetCapabilities and GetMap 
operations (requests and responses); a Queryable WMS includes all Basic WMS 
operations and an additional GetFeatureInfo operation.  

Requirement 1: A DGIWG WMS server shall be compliant to the Queryable WMS 
conformance class. 

According to this requirement a DGIWG WMS server shall support the GetCapabilities, 
GetMap and GetFeatureInfo operations. This requirement ensures compatibility with the 
base standard. 

6.5. Basic service elements 
The Basic service elements specify aspects of Web Map Server behavior that are 
independent of particular operations or are common to several operations. 

6.5.1. Version number 
The VERSION parameter is mandatory in GetMap and GetFeatureInfo requests. The 
version number is 1.3.0. 

6.5.2. Binding 
The OGC WMS 1.3.0 standard requires support for HTTP Get. Support for HTTP Post is 
optional. A SOAP binding is not defined in the standard.  

Requirement 2: A DGIWG WMS server shall support HTTP GET. 

6.5.3. Output Formats 
The response to a Web Map Service request is always a computer file. The file may 
contain text, or the file may represent a map image depending on the operation. For the 
particular operations a DGIWG WMS server shall support the following output formats. 

6.5.3.1. Output formats for GetCapabilities and GetFeatureInfo 
requests 

The response to a GetCapabilities or GetFeatureInfo request is always a text file. 

Requirement 3: A DGIWG WMS server shall support text/xml and text/html as output 
formats for the GetCapabilities and the GetFeatureInfo Operations. 

Requirement 4: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide metadata content in a response to 
a "GetCapabilities" or “GetFeatureInfo” request in English language. 

NOTE: Services can also be provided using alternative languages to English: This profile 
does not specify the details for implementation of multilingual services. 

6.5.3.2. Output formats for GetMap requests 
The response to a GetMap request is either a raster or vector file. 

Requirement 5: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the following raster formats for 
the GetMap operation: 

 image/png (Portable Network Graphics) 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

10 

 image/gif (Graphics Interchange Format) 
 image/jpeg (Joint Photographics Expert Group) 

Recommendation 1: If a service requires vector based graphical elements output, a 
DGIWG WMS server should provide image/svg+xml (Scalable Vector Graphics) for the 
GetMap operation. 

NOTE: Users should be aware that only the output formats GIF and PNG support 
transparency. 

6.5.4. Coordinate Systems 
The Web Map Service standard uses two principal classes of Coordinate Systems: a 
Map CS applicable to the map portrayal generated by the WMS, and a Layer CRS for a 
Bounding Box applied to the source data. During a portrayal operation, a WMS converts 
or transforms geographic information from a Layer CRS into a Map CS. In addition, a 
Layer may have an associated vertical, temporal or other coordinate system. 

6.5.4.1. Map CS 
A Map CS is a coordinate reference system for a map produced by a WMS. A WMS map 
is a rectangular grid of pixels displayed on a computer screen (or a digital file that could 
be so displayed). The Map CS has a horizontal axis denoted i, and a vertical axis 
denoted j. i and j shall have only nonnegative integer values. The origin (i,j) =(0,0) is the 
pixel in the upper left corner of the map; i increases to the right and j increases 
downward. 

6.5.4.2. Layer CRS 
A Layer CRS is a horizontal coordinate reference system for the geographic information 
that serves as the source for a map. A WMS must support at least one CRS, and maps 
from multiple servers may be overlaid only if all the selected servers support at least one 
CRS in common. 

Requirement 6: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the following coordinate 
reference systems: 

 CRS:84 WGS84 geographic longitude, then latitude, expressed in decimal 
degrees 

 EPSG:4326 WGS84 geographic latitude, then longitude, expressed in decimal 
degrees 

 EPSG:3395 World Mercator projection 

Among the following Coordinate Reference Systems, the service shall support all 
those which validity zone overlaps data published by the service: 

 UTM projections over WGS84 (north zones)…  EPSG:32601 to EPSG:32660 
 UTM projections over  WGS84 (south zones)…  EPSG:32701 to EPSG:32760 
 UPS projection over WGS84 (north zone)…  EPSG:32661 
 UPS projection over WGS84 (south zone)…  EPSG:32761 

Implementation guidance: 

NOTE: Normative Reference 1, Section 7.2.4.6.6 states that: "Every named Layer shall have exactly 
one <EX_GeographicBoundingBox> element that is either stated explicitly or inherited from a parent 
Layer”.  This is unclear in the base standard. Chapter 7.2.4.6.8 BoundingBox in the base standard 
states that: The <EX_GeographicBoundingBox> element (7.2.4.6.6) is conceptually similar to a 
BoundingBox in which the attribute CRS="CRS:84" is implicit. However, 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

11 

<EX_GeographicBoundingBox> shall not be used as a substitute for <BoundingBox CRS="CRS:84">. 
If the server wishes to provide bounding box information in the CRS:84 CRS, then a separate 
BoundingBox element explicitly naming CRS:84 shall be included in the service metadata. 
This means that Ex_GeographicBoundingBox within a DGIWG server shall always be in 
CRS="CRS:84". 
 
 
Some geographic information may be available at other dimensions like for instance 
elevation or time (3D / 4D). For example, in the case of elevation, atmospheric information 
like ozone concentrations, may be available at different altitudes. Similarly, geographic 
information may be available at multiple times, like hourly tidal information. 
 
NOTE: Appropriate vertical and temporal coordinate systems have to be defined in the 
context of the particular application.  
The verticalCRSid “CRS:88” refers to the vertical CRS defined in B.6 (elevation in meters in 
the North American Vertical Datum 1988). The unitSymbol “m” would be used.. See 
Normative Reference 1, Annex C “Handling multi-dimensional data” for more information. 

6.5.5. Request Parameter Rules 
Parameter names shall not be case sensitive, but parameter values shall be. Parameters in 
a request may be specified in any order.  

6.5.5.1. Common Request Parameters 
There are three common request parameters: 

 Version: The VERSION parameter specifies the protocol version number. 
 Request: The REQUEST parameter indicates which service operation is being 

invoked. 
 Format: The FORMAT parameter specifies the output format of the response to an 

operation. 

6.5.5.2. Exceptions 
The EXCEPTIONS request parameter states the format in which to report errors. 

Requirement 7: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide service exceptions in English 
language. 

6.5.5.3. Extended capabilities and operations 
The Web Map Service allows for optional extended capabilities and operations. Extended 
capabilities or operations shall be defined when necessary by providing instances of the 
abstract <_ExtendedCapabilities> or <_ExtendedOperations> elements in the service 
metadata schema. 
 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

12 

6.6. Operations 
The WMS Interface offers 3 Operations.  

 GetCapabilities (mandatory): Allows for obtaining Service Metadata 
 GetMap (mandatory): Returns a map 
 GetFeatureInfo (optional): Provides additional information about features in the 

pictures of maps that were returned by previous GetMap requests 

6.6.1. GetCapabilities Operation Request 
The purpose of the mandatory GetCapabilities operation is to obtain service metadata, which 
is a machine readable (and human-readable) description of the server’s information content 
and acceptable request parameter values. Table 3 lists the GetCapabilities request 
parameters. 
 

Request Parameter OGC 
Mandatory
/Optional 

Description 

VERSION=version O Request version 

SERVICE=WMS M Service type (WMS) 

REQUEST=GetCapabilities M Request name (GetCapabilities) 

FORMAT=MIME_type O Output format of service metadata (text/xml) 

UPDATESEQUENCE=string O Sequence number or string for cache control 

Table 3: The parameters of a GetCapabilities request URL as per Normative Reference 
[1] 

Requirement 8: A DGIWG WMS server shall support all GetCapabilities request 
parameters. 

6.6.2. GetCapabilities Operation Response 
When invoked on a WMS, the response to a GetCapabilities request shall be an XML 
document containing service metadata formatted according to the XML Schema in annex 
E.1 of the OGC WMS 1.3 standard Normative Reference [1].  

6.6.2.1. Names and titles 
A number of elements have both a <Name> and a <Title>. The Name is a text string used 
for machine-to-machine communication while the Title is for the benefit of humans. 

6.6.2.2. General service metadata 
The first part of the service metadata is a <Service> element providing general metadata for 
the server as a whole. It shall include a Name, Title, and Online Resource URL. Optional 
service metadata includes Abstract, Keyword List, Contact Information, Fees, Access 
Constraints, and limits the number of layers in a request or the output size of maps. 
 

Requirement 9: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide all mandatory and optional 
service metadata elements. 

The optional <LayerLimit> element in the service metadata is a positive integer indicating the 
maximum number of layers a client is permitted to include in a single GetMap request. If this 
element is absent, the server imposes no limit. 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

13 

The elements <Fees> and <AccessConstraints> may be omitted in an OGC WMS if they do 
not apply to the server. If either of those elements is present, the reserved word "none" 
(case-insensitive) shall be used if there are no fees or access constraints, as follows: 
<Fees>none</Fees>, <AccessConstraints>none</AccessConstraints>. 
 
In a DGIWG WMS server the AccessConstraints element shall always be used. In an NATO 
environment, the common NATO classification scheme has to be applied (see Normative 
Reference [3] DMF chapter 5.6.1.4 Classification Level Codelist). 
 
Requirement 10: A DGIWG WMS server shall identify the highest classification level of 
the content accessible through the WMS service by populating the 
wms:AccessConstraints element. 

 

6.6.2.3. Capability metadata 
The <Capability> element of the service metadata names the actual operations that are 
supported by the server, the output formats offered for those operations, and the URL prefix 
for each operation. The XML schema includes placeholders for Distributed Computing 
Platforms other than HTTP, but currently only the HTTP platform is defined. 

 Layers and styles: Each available map is advertised by a <Layer> element in the 
service metadata. A server shall include at least one <Layer> element for each map 
layer offered. 

 Layer properties: The <Layer> element can enclose child elements providing 
metadata about the Layer. The values of some of these elements can be inherited by 
subsidiary layers. The following metadata elements are available: 
o Title: A <Title> is mandatory for all layers; it is a human-readable string for 

presentation in a menu. The Title is not inherited by child Layers. 
o Name: If, and only if, a layer has a <Name>, then it is a map layer that can be 

requested by using that Name in the LAYERS parameter of a GetMap request. If 
the layer has a Title but no Name, then that layer is only a category title for all 
the layers nested within. A containing category itself may include a Name by 
which a map portraying all of the nested layers can be requested at once. For 
example, a parent layer "Roads" may have children “Interstates” and “State 
Highways” and allow the user to request either child individually or both together. 

o The elements <Abstract> and <KeywordList> are optional in the base 
standard. Abstract is a narrative description of the map layer. KeywordList 
contains zero or more <Keyword> elements to aid in catalogue searches. 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

14 

Requirement 11: A DGIWG WMS server shall include the following information in the 
abstract element of the service metadata: "This service implements the DGIWG WMS 
1.3 profile version 1.0." 

Requirement 12: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide a minimum keyword list based 
on the DFDD groups:  

 Aeronautical 
 Biota 
 Characteristics 
 Demarcation 
 Hydrography and Oceanography 
 Industries and Services 
 Metadata and References 
 Military 
 Names and Designations 
 Physiography 
 Socio-economic Geography 
 Transportation 
 Weather and Climate 

NOTE: Additional keywords may be added to the list as appropriate to support data 
discovery. 

o Zero or more Styles may be advertised for a Layer or collection of layers using 
<Style> elements, each of which shall have <Name> and <Title> elements.  
§ The style's Name is used in the Map request STYLES parameter.  
§ The Title is a human-readable string. If only a single style is available, that 

style is known as the “default” style and need not be advertised by the 
server. 

Requirement 13: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide information on the supported 
styles. 

Requirement 14: A DGIWG WMS server shall always provide at least one style element 
and that style shall be advertised even if it's only the default style. 

Requirement 15: The MaxWidth and MaxHeight shall be greater or equal to 800 pixels. 

o <LegendURL> contains the location of an image of a map legend appropriate to 
the enclosing style. 

Requirement 16: Each vector data layer's style shall have an associated legend, 
available as an image in one of the following formats: PNG, GIF or JPEG.  

Recommendation 2: It is recommended to also provide legends for raster layers 
representing numeric data like for instance elevation or temperature data 

Requirement 17: This legend shall be accessible online at the URL specified by 
LegendURL. 

o Scale denominators: The <MinScaleDenominator> and 
<MaxScaleDenominator> elements define the range of scales for which it is 
appropriate to generate a map of a Layer. 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

15 

Requirement 18: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide scale denominators for all layers 
it provides. 

Requirement 19: The <MinScaleDenominator> value shall always be less than or equal 
to the <MaxScaleDenominator> value. 

Recommendation 3: A DGIWG WMS service should be configured to serve requests 
that range from at least 4x to at least 0.25x the native scale(s) or resolution(s) of the 
underlying datasets". 

NOTE: Users should be aware that changing the resolution at a range of 4 times to 0.25 
times effects the accuracy of the displayed data significantly and will influence the usability 
of the data for certain use cases (e.g. measurements in the map). 
 

o Sample dimensions: Some geographic information may be available at other 
dimensions (for example, satellite images in different wavelength bands). The 
dimensions other than the four space-time dimensions are referred to as “sample 
dimensions. A DGIWG WMS server may allow for requesting a particular layer 
along one or more dimensional axes other than time or elevation. 

o MetadataURL: A server should use one or more <MetadataURL> elements to 
offer detailed, standardized metadata about the data corresponding to a 
particular layer. The “type” attribute indicates the standard to which the metadata 
complies. Two “type” attribute values are defined in ISO 19128:2005, "ISO 
19115:2003" and “FGDC:1998”. The enclosed <Format> element indicates the 
file format MIME type of the metadata record. 

Recommendation 4: In an SDI like architecture, a DGIWG WMS server should provide 
a link to the metadata resource via a resolvable URL for example to a CSW server. 

o FeatureListURL: A server may use a <FeatureListURL> element to point to a 
list of the features represented in a Layer. The enclosed Format element 
indicates the file format MIME type of the feature list. 

Requirement 20: If the GetCapabilities document identifies support for 
FeatureListURL then the list of features that are in the particular layer shall be 
resolvable through the provided URL. 

o DataURL: A server may use DataURL to offer a link to the underlying data 
represented by a particular layer. The enclosed Format element indicates the file 
format MIME type of the data file. 

Requirement 21: If the GetCapabilities document identifies support for DataURL then 
the underlying data of the particular layer shall be resolvable through the provided 
URL. 

 Layer attributes: A <Layer> may have zero or more of the following XML attributes: 
queryable, cascaded, opaque, noSubsets, fixedWidth, and fixedHeight. All of these 
attributes are optional and default to 0. The meaning of each attribute is summarized in 
Table 4

positive integer   

0, 0: WMS can produce map of arbitrary 
height.  
nonzero: value is fixed map height that 
cannot be changed by the WMS.   

Table 4: Layer attributes 

Requirement 22: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide the Layer Attributes according 
to Table 4. 

Recommendation 5: A DGIWG WMS server offering vector layers should be queryable 

The Layer metadata may also include three optional attributes that indicate a map server 
that is less functional than a normal WMS, because it is not able to extract a subset of a 
larger dataset or because it only serves maps of a fixed size and cannot resize them. 
 
When set to a true value, noSubsets indicates that the server is not able to make a map of 
a geographic area other than the layer's bounding box. 
 
When present and nonzero, fixedWidth and fixedHeight indicate that the server is not able 
to produce a map of the layer at a width and height different from the fixed sizes indicated. 
According to Table 4 a DGIWG WMS server provides only subsettable (nosubsets=0) and 
resizable (fixedWidth=0 and fixedHeight=0) layers. As the 0 values are the default values, 
they do not have to be included explicitly for all layers.

Table 5: GetMap request parameters 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

18 

Requirement 23: A DGIWG WMS server shall support all GetMap request parameters. 

 Styles: The mandatory STYLES parameter lists the style in which each layer is to be 
rendered.  

 Width, Height: The mandatory WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters specify the size in 
integer pixels of the map to be produced. 

 TRANSPARENT: The optional TRANSPARENT parameter specifies whether the map 
background is to be made transparent or not. TRANSPARENT can take on two values, 
"TRUE" or "FALSE". The default value is FALSE if this parameter is absent from the 
request. 
 

Requirement 24: A DGIWG WMS Service shall support transparency 
 EXCEPTIONS: The optional EXCEPTIONS parameter defines the format of an error 

message. XML is mandatory and the default format for exceptions.  

o INIMAGE: If the EXCEPTIONS parameter is set to INIMAGE, the WMS shall, 
upon detecting an error, return an object of the MIME type specified in the 
FORMAT parameter whose content includes text describing the nature of the 
error. In the case of a picture format, the error message shall be drawn on the 
returned picture. In the case of a graphic element format, the text of the error 
message shall be rendered in the manner that text is normally represented in 
that format. 

Requirement 25: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the INIMAGE EXCEPTIONS. 

o BLANK: If the EXCEPTIONS parameter is set to BLANK, the WMS shall, upon 
detecting an error, return an object of the type specified in FORMAT whose 
content is uniformly “off”. In the case of a picture format, that response shall be 
an image containing only pixels of one color (the background color). In the case 
of a picture format supporting transparency, if TRANSPARENT=TRUE is 
specified the pixels shall all be transparent. In the case of a graphic element 
output format, no visible graphic elements shall be included in the response 
output. 

Requirement 26: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the BLANK EXCEPTIONS. 

 Time, Elevation, Other sample dimensions: An example would be the request for a 
single ozone map at specified time and height:

03&ELEVATION=1000&FORMAT=image/gif 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

19 

Requirement 27: If a DGIWG WMS server provides multi-dimensional data then it 
shall: 

 Support the vertical Elevation and temporal Time request parameters. 
 Handle data utilized in these parameters in accordance with the "OGC Best 

Practices for using OGC WMS with Time-Dependent or Elevation-Dependent 
Data [2]" 

 
NOTE: Conformant WMS servers should express the values of the time dimension either 
as one time interval with non-zero resolution when the temporal dependency of the data is 
time instants or as a comma separated list of timestamps. 
 
The WMS 1.3 specification allows the possibility to define multiple times as several triplets: 
start/end/interval. The triplets define sets of time instants that may overlap. It is difficult for a 
human reader to determine the allowed times of the time dimension. Hence, the time 
dimension should not be specified as a list of triplets, except if the time instants are regularly 
spaced with a unique interval of time. If not the time instance should be specified as a 
comma separated list. 
 
Requirement 28: A DGIWG WMS server that announces available sample dimensions 
in its service metadata shall resolve the corresponding parameters provided in the 
GetMap operation for requesting these dimensional values. 

Example 

A WMS Layer is described as having an extent along a dimension named “wavelength” 
as follows: 
 
<Dimension name="wavelength" units="Angstrom" 
unitSymbol="Ao">3000,4000,5000,6000<Dimension>.A GetMap request for a portrayal of 
the data at 4000 Angstroms would include the parameter “DIM_WAVELENGTH=4000”." 

6.6.4. GetMap Response  
The response to a valid GetMap request shall be a map of the spatially referenced 
information layer requested, in the desired style, and having the specified coordinate 
reference system, bounding box, size, format and transparency. 

6.6.5. GetFeatureInfo Operation Request 
GetFeatureInfo is an optional operation. It is only supported for those Layers for which the 
attribute queryable="1" (true) has been defined or inherited. A client shall not issue a 
GetFeatureInfo request for other layers. A WMS shall respond with a properly formatted 
service exception (XML) response (code = OperationNotSupported) if it receives a 
GetFeatureInfo request but does not support it. 
 
The GetFeatureInfo operation is designed to provide clients of a WMS with more information 
about features in the pictures of maps that were returned by previous Map requests. The 
canonical use case for GetFeatureInfo is that a user sees the response of a Map request 
and chooses a point (I,J) on that map for which to obtain more information. The basic 
operation provides the ability for a client to specify which pixel is being asked about, which 
layer(s) should be investigated, and what format the information should be returned in.  
Because the WMS protocol is stateless, the GetFeatureInfo request indicates to the WMS 
what map the user is viewing by including most of the original GetMap request parameters 
(all but VERSION and REQUEST). From the spatial context information (BBOX, CRS, 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

20 

WIDTH, HEIGHT) in that GetMap request, along with the I,J position the user chose, the 
WMS can (possibly) return additional information about that position. 
The parameters of a GetFeatureInfo request are listed in Table 6. 
 
Request Parameter OGC 

Mandatory
/ Optional 

DGIWG  
Mandatory
/ Optional 

Description 

VERSION=1.3.0 M M Request version. 

REQUEST=GetFeatureInfo M M Request name. 

map request part M M Partial copy of the Map request 
parameters that generated the map for 
which information is desired. 

QUERY_LAYERS=layer_list M M Comma-separated list of one or more 
layers to be queried. 

INFO_FORMAT=output_format M M Return format of feature information 
(MIME type). 

FEATURE_COUNT=number O M Number of features about which to 
return information (default=1). 

I=pixel_column M M i coordinate in pixels of feature in Map 
CS. 

J=pixel_row M M j coordinate in pixels of feature in Map 
CS. 

EXCEPTIONS=exception_format O M 
 

The format in which exceptions are to 
be reported by the WMS (default= 
XML). Support of text/xml and 
text/html is mandatory. 

Table 6: GetFeatureInfo Request parameters 

6.6.5.1. Version 
The VERSION parameter is mandatory. The value “1.3.0” shall be used for GetFeatureInfo 
requests that comply with ISO 19128:2005. 

6.6.5.2. Request 
The REQUEST parameter is mandatory. For GetFeatureInfo, the value “GetFeatureInfo” 
shall be used. 

6.6.5.3. Map request part 
The mandatory “map request part” represents a sequence of parameters from the GetMap 
request that generated the original map. Two of the GetMap parameters are omitted 
because GetFeatureInfo provides its own values: VERSION and REQUEST. The remainder 
of the GetMap request shall be embedded contiguously in the GetFeatureInfo request. 

6.6.5.4. Query_Layers 
The mandatory QUERY_LAYERS parameter states the map layer(s) from which feature 
information is desired to be retrieved. Its value is a comma-separated list of one or more 
map layers. This parameter shall contain at least one layer name, but may contain fewer 
layers than the original GetMap request. If any layer in the QUERY_LAYERS parameter is 
not defined in the service metadata of the WMS, the server shall issue a service exception 
(code = LayerNotDefined). 



STD-DP-14-013r3  16 November 2015 
 

21 

6.6.5.5. INFO_FORMAT 
The mandatory INFO_FORMAT parameter indicates what format to use when returning the 
feature information. 

6.6.5.6. Feature_COUNT 
The optional FEATURE_COUNT parameter states the maximum number of features per 
layer for which feature information shall be returned. Its value is a positive integer. The 
default value is 1 if this parameter is omitted or is other than a positive integer. 
 
Requirement 29: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the FEATURE_COUNT 
parameter to enable the increase of the number of features per layer for which the 
server returns information.  
 
NOTE: Using a high value for the Feature_COUNT parameter may affect server 
performance. A server might restrict the number of features for which information is 
retrievable. This limitation has to be advertised in the capabilities document.  

6.6.5.7. I, J 
The mandatory I and J request parameters are integers that indicate a point of interest on 
the map that was produced by the embedded GetMap request (the “map request part” 
described in 7.4.3.3). The point (I,J) is a point in the (i,j) space defined by the Map CS (see 
6.7.2). Therefore: 

 the value of I shall be between 0 and the maximum value of the i axis; 
 the value of J shall be between 0 and the maximum value of the j axis; 
 the point I=0, J=0 indicates the pixel at the upper left corner of the map; 
 I increases to the right and J increases downward. 

 
The point (I,J) represents the centre of the indicated pixel. 
If the value of I or of J is invalid, the server shall issue a service exception (code = 
InvalidPoint). 

6.6.5.8. EXCEPTIONS 
The EXCEPTIONS parameter is optional. If this parameter is absent from the request, the 
default value is "XML". No other values are defined by ISO 19128:2005 for the WMS 
GetFeatureInfo request. Use of text/html is for the benefit of human readable content. 
 
Requirement 30: A DGIWG WMS server shall support the EXCEPTIONS parameter 
support of text/xml and text/html. 

6.6.6. GetFeatureInfo response 
The server shall return a response according to the requested INFO_FORMAT if the request 
is valid, or issue a service exception otherwise. The nature of the response is at the 
discretion of the service provider, but it shall pertain to the feature(s) nearest to (I,J). 
 
Requirement 31: A DGIWG WMS server shall provide a response according to the 
INFO_Format. 
 
Requirement 32: A DGIWG WMS server shall return the units of measure for 
dimensional values returned in a GetFeatureInfo response.

7. Quality of Service 
Quality of service comprises requirements on all the aspects of a connection. A DGIWG 
WMS server should meet the following guidelines for performance, availability and capacity. 

7.1. Performance 
Recommendation 6: For a 470 Kilobytes image, the response time for sending the 
initial response to a Get Map Request to a view service shall be maximum 5 seconds 
in normal situation.  

NOTE: Normal situation represents periods out of peak load. It is set at 90% of the time. 

7.2. Capacity 
Recommendation 7: The number of simultaneous service requests that a DGIWG 
WMS server should be able to support is at least 20 per second. 

7.3. Availability 
Recommendation 8: A DGIWG WMS server should be available 99.9% of the time.  

NOTE: This relates to 10 minutes downtime per week, 0.73 hours per month and 8.73 hours 
per year.

Annex E – UTM Grid and MGRS Grid System Handling in 
WMS Clients and Portals  

(informative) 

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Grid and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) 
Grid values are commonly used by military operational staff to exchange positions. They 
both are based on an underlying set of Universal Transverse Mercator projections based on 
horizontal cylinders which are distributed around the earth (there is a different projection for 
each six degrees of longitude). UTM projection values tend to be large numbers (a pair of x 
and y numbers) so to make these easier to deal with by humans, two grid systems (UTM 
Grid and MGRS Grid) are used. Both allocate grid cells across the world, using the ‘Zone’ 
between 1 and 60 to define the UTM Projection and a letter to define the vertical dimension.  

	

UTM	Zones	and	Cell	letters	

So the intersection of the equator and Greenwich Meridian intersect (lat long 0,0) exists in 
several overlapping cells including 31N. Within a cell, UTM Grid simply allocates values 
based on x and y increments in the projection, so: Lat Long 0, 0 would be UTM Grid 31N 
0166021 0000000. MGRS however further subdivides the square into more lettered squares, 
and so would be 31N AA 66021 00000 (see below). 

	

MGRS	Cell	names

Issues associated with UTM Grid and MGRS Grid Values in WMS Services 

Firstly, there is the issue of using UTM Grid and MGRS Grid Coordinates. It is unlikely that 
client applications will want to request WMS display areas using either of these grid values, 
as client applications are unlikely to internally use these Grids. Most client applications 
convert the grid values to numeric Universal Transverse Mercator values using a table 
(associating the cell with an X/Y coordinate in UTM projection) and then work in UTM 
coordinates. 

Additionally there is an issue with treating a UTM Grid or MGRS Grid as a coordinate 
reference system as there is no defined separation between ordinates (the Cell names of AA 
etc. embody both X and Y) and therefore it is impossible to define individual ordinates or an 
axis order which is mandatory for a CRS. Most common is for dialogs or entry methods that 
support the grids to be included, and a conversion applied (which is as stated a simple table 
look up). This is also true for querying where clicking on the map generates a grid value.  

While it is quite possible to implement this in JavaScript another approach is to have a web 
service (maybe WPS or a simple Restful service) which takes a Lat/Long or UTM value and 
generates a UTM grid or MGRS grid value and vice versa.  

Displaying UTM Grid and MGRS Grid 

A typical approach here is to have a Web Map Service which simply displays the relevant 
UTM Grid or MGRS Grid at the correct resolution (see the examples above). This can then 
be simply added as a layer to the client over the background WMSs. Configuration of level of 
detail, colour style etc. is also potentially a requirement but this is a fairly simple service to 
produce and is really unrelated to the coordinate system issues. However it would be 
possible for it to provide a ‘GetFeatureInfo’ service which returned the coordinate values in 
one or more grid systems that it is presenting.   

It is not uncommon for most military focused client software packages (example below) 
which in many cases exploit WMS to provide all of the above capabilities (including a UTM 
Grid and MGRS Grid Helper, and Visualisation of the grids).
