Introduction 

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS)–CRS Extension defines an extension to the WCS 
Core [OGC 09-146r2] allowing to obtain coverages in various Coordinate Reference Systems 
(CRSs). 

While the WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4] defines access only in the coverage’s Native CRS (i.e., 
the one in which the coverage is stored on the server), this WCS CRS Extension defines how 
to request and obtain a coverage in CRSs different from the Native CRS, and also how to 
provide a subsetting bounding box with coordinates in a CRS different from the Native CRS. 

CRSs in this WCS Extension are identified by CRS Identifiers such as defined in the OGC 
CRS Name Type Definition [OGC 11-135]. A WCS server supporting this WCS CRS 
Extension announces the CRSs supported by listing their CRS Identifiers in its Capabilities 
document.

OGC® Web Coverage Service Interface Standard - CRS 
Extension 

1 Scope 

This OGC WCS CRS Extension – in short: CRS Extension – defines an extension to the WCS 
Core [OGC 09-110r4] allowing to obtain coverages and to specify subsets in various 
Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs). 

While the WCS Core defines access only in the coverage’s Native CRS (i.e., the one in 
which the coverage is stored on the server), this WCS CRS Extension defines how to request 
and obtain a coverage in CRSs different from the Native CRS, and also how to provide a 
subsetting bounding box with coordinates in a CRS different from the Native CRS. 

CRSs in this WCS Extension are identified by CRS Identifiers such as defined in the OGC 
CRS Name Type Definition [OGC 11-135]. A WCS server supporting this WCS CRS 
Extension announces the CRSs supported by listing them in its Capabilities document.

5.4 Multiple representations 

When multiple representations of the same information are given in a specification document 
these are consistent. Should this not be the case then this is considered an error, and the XML 
schema shall take precedence. 

6 Crs requirements class 

6.1 Overview 

Clients and servers supporting this CRS extension are CRS aware, that is: they can request 
and deliver coverages in CRSs other than only the one in which they are originally stored. A 
server announces both CRS support and the concrete CRSs known in the Capabilities 
document; a client can request delivery of a coverage obtained through a GetCoverage 
request in one of these CRSs announced by the server. 

This Clause 6 establishes the CRS Extension core conformance class, crs, which defines how 
Web Coverage Services shall deal with CRSs. 

6.2 Modifications to GetCapabilities 

A server announces support of the CRS extension to a client by adding the URL identifying 
this extension to the list of supported extensions delivered in the Capabilities document. 

Requirement 1 crs/extension-identifier: 
A WCS service implementing conformance class crs of this CRS Extension shall include the 
following URI in the Profile element of the ServiceIdentification in a 
GetCapabilities response: 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-extension_crs/1.0/conf/crs 
Dependency: WCS Core [OGC 09-110r4], 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS/2.0/req/core 

A Crs item is added to the WCS service metadata using the extension mechanism provided 
by the WCS Core [OGC 09-110r3]. In its crsSupported component it contains the list of 
CRSs in which the server can return coverages. 

Requirement 2 crs/capabilities-crs: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall adhere to Figure 1, Table 3, and 
the XML schema defined for this CRS Extension. 

Figure 1 presents the UML diagram of the extended Capabilities document. Table 3 details 
the components added.

(optional) 

 

Requirement 3 crs/wcsServiceMetadata-crs: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall contain a crs:CrsMetadata 
element in the wcs:Extension element of wcs:ServiceMetadata. 

Requirement 4 crs/wcsServiceMetadata-outputCrs: 
The crsSupported item(s) delivered in the CrsMetadata element of the response to a 
successful GetCapabilities request shall consist of URLs, each one resolving to an 
instantiatable subtype of GML::AbstractCRS. 

Note This does not per se mean that every CRS reported in the Capabilities document is applicable to 
every coverage available from the server or to every possible trim or slice subset of such a coverage. For 
example, a server may offer 2D and 3D coverages, in which case 2D coverages cannot be retrieved in a 3D 
CRS, and vice versa. Further, 2D slices from a 3D coverage cannot be returned in a 3D CRS, but require a 
2D output CRS. 

Requirement 5 crs/wcsServiceMetadata-outputCrs-unique: 
The list of crsSupported element(s) delivered in the CrsMetadata element of the 
response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall not contain any duplicates. 

A client should not assume that a CRS list is delivered in some particular order. 

6.3 Modifications to DescribeCoverage 

None. 



OGC 11-053r1

6.4 Modifications to GetCoverage 

6.4.1 Modifications to the GetCoverage request 

The GetCoverage request is extended with two optional parameters indicating the CRSs for 
subsetting coordinates and for the result coverage. If these parameters are omitted then all 
access will be performed in the coverage’s Native CRS (as reported in its Coverage 
Description).   

Note This normally ensures that the coverage’s unchanged range set values are retrieved, assuming 
that no other operations than subsetting is performed in the GetCoverage request. 

Requirement 6 crs/getCoverage-crs: 
A GetCoverage request shall adhere to Figure 2, Table 4, and the XML schema defined for 
this CRS Extension whereby, in the XML request encoding, the GetCoverage wcs:Exten-
sion element shall contain exactly one GetCoverageCrs element.

coordinates are expressed 

anyURI zero or one

outputCrs CRS Identifier indicating the CRS

anyURI zero or one 
(optional) 

 
A GetCoverage request may contain an additional parameter, subsettingCrs, to indicate 
the CRS in which the subsetting coordinates passed are expressed. Admissible values for this 
parameter are URIs which resolve to exactly one CRS. 



OGC 11-053r1 
 

7 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Requirement 7 crs/getCoverage-subsettingCrs-default: 
If the subsettingCrs parameter is not present in a GetCoverage request then the request 
shall be evaluated as if a subsettingCrs parameter equal to the coverage’s Native CRS 
(as provided in the Coverage Description) had been provided. 

Requirement 8 crs/getCoverage-subsettingCrs-uniqueCrsName: 
The subsettingCrs parameter in a GetCoverage request, if present, shall have as its value 
a CRS Identifier. 

Requirement 9 crs/getCoverage-subsettingCrs-availableCrs: 
The subsettingCrs parameter in a GetCoverage request, if present, shall have as its value 
a CRS Identifier described in the crsSupported list delivered in the CrsMetadata 
element of the Capabilities document of the server addressed. 

Note As per WCS Core [OGC 09-110r3] every coverage has a Native CRS associated which will be 
contained in this list among potentially more CRSs; therefore, this list will never be empty as long as the 
server offers at least one coverage. 

A GetCoverage request may contain an additional parameter, outputCrs, to indicate a 
particular CRS in which the client wants to receive the result coverage produced by the 
server. Admissible values for this parameter are URIs which resolve to exactly one CRS. 

Requirement 10 crs/getCoverage-outputCrs-default: 
If the outputCrs parameter is not present in a GetCoverage request then the request shall 
be evaluated as if an outputCrs parameter equal to the subsettingCrs parameter value 
assumed for this request’s evaluation had been provided. 

Requirement 11 crs/getCoverage-outputCrs-uniqueCrsName: 
The outputCrs parameter in a GetCoverage request, if present, shall have as its value a 
CRS Identifier. 

Requirement 12 crs/getCoverage-outputCrs-availableCrs: 
The outputCrs parameter in a GetCoverage request, if present, shall have as its value a 
CRS Identifier described in the crsSupported list delivered in the CrsMetadata 
element of the Capabilities document of the server addressed. 

Note As per WCS Core [OGC 09-110r3] every coverage has a Native CRS associated which will be  
in this list among potentially more CRSs; therefore, this list will never be empty as long as the server offers 
at least one coverage. 

6.4.2 Modifications to the GetCoverage response 

Requirement 13 crs/getCoverage-response-crs: 
The contents of the response to a successful GetCoveragerequest containing an outputCrs 
parameter shall have, in the gml:boundedBy element, an srsName value identical to the 
outputCrs element in the request. 

Example The following is a valid srsName specification: 
<gml:boundedBy ... srsName=”http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326” ...> 

Note If a request contains neither subsettingCrs nor outputCrs then, as per Requirement 
10, the outputCrs likewise defaults to the coverage’s Native CRS.

No statement is made in this specification about the interpolation method applied by the 
server in the course of the CRS transformation. A server is free to employ any interpolation 
method during CRS transformation, and information about the interpolation applied may not 
be accessible to the client. While the interpolation method applied may change over requests, 
and different interpolation methods may be applied to different range components of a 
particular coverage, a server should not change interpolation across the domain of coverage 
during execution of a single coverage CRS transformation.  

Note The WCS Interpolation Extension allows controlling interpolation behaviour. 

6.5 Exceptions 

Requirement 14 crs/getCoverage-exception: 
When a WCS server encounters an error while evaluating the outputCrs parameter in a 
GetCoverage operation it shall return an exception report message chosen as indicated in 
Table 4. For each listed exceptionCode, the contents of the locator parameter value 
shall be as specified in the right column in Table 5.

7.1 Overview 

This Clause 7 establishes the CRS Extension conformance class crs-gridded-coverage which 
defines how Web Coverage Services shall deal with CRSs when Grid Coverages (in the 
definition of GML 3.2.1 [OGC 09-146r1]) are addressed. 

Note As per GML 3.2.1 [OGC 09-146r1], this encompasses the coverage classes GML::Grid-
Coverage, GML::RectifiedGridCoverage, and GML::ReferenceableGrid-
Coverage. 

Requirement 19 crs-gridded-coverage/dependency: 
A WCS service implementing conformance class crs-gridded-coverage of this CRS 
Extension shall also implement the crs conformance class of this CRS Extension.

Extension shall include the following URI in the Profile element of the 
ServiceIdentification in a GetCapabilities response: 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_service-extension_crs/1.0/conf/crs-
gridded-coverage 

7.3 Modifications to GetCoverage 

For Grid Coverages, a conceptual evaluation model is specified. Implementations can choose to 
employ different algorithms as long as the result data are identical. 

Requirement 21 crs-gridded-coverage/getCoverage-rangeSet: 
The range values of the response to a successful GetCoverage request containing an 
outputCrs parameter shall be determined according to the following conceptual 
evaluation model: Take the bounding box of the request’s subsetting parameter (or the full 
coverage bounding box if no subsetting was specified in the request); re-project this 
bounding box to the output CRS provided; generate the result image extent as the smallest 
bounding box around the reprojected subsetting box; fill this new image extent with pixel 
values re-projected from the coverage’s Native CRS to the output CRS in a way that, for each 
axis, the smallest distance between any two reprojected grid points is used as offset 
(including all interpolation and resampling necessary) unless specified otherwise by further 
request parameters. 

Note Request parameters dictating a different behaviour wrt. grid point offset are defined in the 
WCS Scaling & Interpolation extension specification.
