 OWS-7 Motion Video Change Detection 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This Engineering Report documents the development effort to build a Web Processing 

Service (WPS) to perform a change detection algorithm on two motion video streams.  It will 

examine the WPS Motion Video Change Detection architecture from various viewpoints in 

order to describe its purpose, data models, functional decomposition, and interaction between 

distinct computational components.

1.4 Future work 

Improvements in this document are desirable to address open issues; to correct errors or 

enhance existing document content. 

Within the OWS-7 testbed, a lack of data sources with appropriate metadata caused some 

limiting of the functionality in the study.  Future work might include: 

 The ability to consume near real-time video at higher frame rates to evaluate a more 
real-world environment.  

 Demonstrate more client control over the WPS by allowing rules to drive the change 
detection algorithm as well as “sampling” to help the user know how to adjust those 

rules 

 Providing the ability to calculate the “certainty” or “uncertainty” of the identified 
changes 

 Better client integration to show the changed frames overlaid with the live video 
frames 

 With the proliferation of UAVs, it would also be interesting to see how this change 
detection process works from an overhead perspective

5 OWS-7 Motion Video Change Detection Overview 

The specified Motion Video Change Detection ER documents the findings of the 

investigation and experiments to deploy a rules-based motion video change detection 

processing service that identifies changes between two motion video streams over the 

same geographic area.   

The world community faces growing challenges from the proliferation of various types of 

data sources.  This is especially true for motion video.  Although the high volume of 

video data is beneficial, it creates a number of data management and analytical 

challenges.  Detecting changes from imagery over time has been a vital intelligence 

function for decades.  But with the increased use of video, new and more efficient tools 

are required.  Analysts cannot be expected to detect small changes over very large 

geographical areas using only the naked eye.  Thus the need for a processing service to 

perform an automated comparison of video streams over the same geographical area that 

identifies small changes is critical to handling these large data volumes.  Figure 1 shows a 

high-level architecture of the Motion Video Change Detection process.

6.1 Motion Video Change Detection Enterprise Viewpoint 

The Enterprise Viewpoint describes the purpose of the architecture. 

The proliferation of video data is a valuable commodity.  However, the value of that data 

lies in the ability to identify changes and intelligible information to improve the 

capabilities of the decision maker.  Within the intelligence, security, and public safety 

domains, a decision maker’s ability to identify changes between video sources over time 

can be directly responsible for saving lives by allowing potential risks to be seen and thus 

avoided. 

For example, a video of a street view taken from a ground based vehicle or an aerial view 

taken from a UAV is recorded and cataloged.  A few weeks later, another ground based 

vehicle or UAV is recording the same street view or aerial view.  This live video stream 

can be compared to the one recorded weeks earlier to identify new rock or garbage piles 

on the side of the road as potential hiding locations for IEDs.  This identification will 

allow convoys to avoid the area until it can be investigated. 



OGC 10-036r2

A high-level depiction of the Motion Video Change Detection concept is shown in the 

use case diagram in Figure 1.  

 

Figure 1 — Motion Video Change Detection Use Case Diagram 

 

The following scenario details a typical flow of actions based on a ground based vehicle: 

1. Ground vehicle equipped with video camera enters an area of interest (AOI) and is 
acquiring motion imagery. 

2. As the AOI was previously identified as a potential risk zone, the entry of the vehicle 
into the AOI triggers an event.   The action associated with the event is to begin a 

change detection process on the motion imagery. 

3. Activity of the Service for sensor tracking and notification results in the WPS for 
Change Detection to begin. 

4. WPS begins change detection on live motion imagery stream and previously acquired 
imagery from the same track. 

5. WPS Change Detection is performed again with the new rule parameters.  Resulting 
change detection highlights areas of new debris on the side of a road, significant soil 

coloration changes, etc.  Uncertainty of the second result is less than the first. 

6. Crew changes the vehicle route based upon change detection results. 
 

Within the OWS-7 testbed, the Change Detection process was performed on two video 

streams provided through Sensor Observation Services.  As changes are detected, they 

are highlighted as in the examples below and inserted into a third Sensor Observation

Service.  The WPS response contains a status URL that can be polled for processing 

status as well as the endpoint to the SOS from with the updated video can be obtained.  

Video1 Video2 Change 

   

Figure 3 — Example Change Detection Frames 

 

6.2 Motion Video Change Detection Information Viewpoint 

The Information Viewpoint presents a description of the architecture data models. 

This section presents a UML model for the input and outputs of the Motion Video 

Change Detection Architecture. 

6.2.1 Motion Video Change Detection Inputs 

The UML class diagram in Figure 4 represents a standard WPS input schema and depicts 

the data objects that comprise the inputs of the Motion Video Change Detection concept 

presented in this document. Within this testbed, all video streams are being read through 

a Sensor Observation Service.  However, the data objects shown in the UML below are 

defined as a URI for both historical and current video.  This allows a WPS to handle 

video from various types of sources. 

 



OGC 10-036r2

Figure 4 — Standard WPS Input Schema Diagram 

 

Two inputs are required for the invocation of the change detection WPS process. They 

are (1) a historical video and (2) a current (or live) video.  For the OWS-7 testbed, both of 

these inputs are served by an SOS. The schema is further represented in the example 

instance below: 

 



OGC 10-036r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  9 
 

Figure 5 — Motion Video Change Detection Input Instance Example 

 

6.2.2 Motion Video Change Detection Outputs 

The UML class diagram in Figure 6 represents a standard WPS output schema and 

depicts the data objects that comprise the outputs of the Motion Video Change Detection 

concept presented in this document.  The output will simply contain a status along with a 

URI from which to get a continuing status as well as a URI to an xml document 

containing the information needed to access the SOS containing the changed frames.  The 

SOS containing the output frames will contain a series of changed frames showing the 

differences found and associated through a time element to the current (or live) video – 

this will not be a full video stream. 

 

Figure 6 — Motion Video Change Detection Outputs Schema Diagram 

 

The output response of the change detection WPS contains one WPS output element that 

refers to a URI in which the status can be obtained (in the statusLocation attribute of the 

ExecuteResponse element) and a URI to an xml document with SOS connection 



OGC 10-036r2

information (in the /ExecuteResponse/ Process/Metadata@href  attribute).  The schema is 

further represented in the example instance below: 

 

Figure 7 — Motion Video Change Detection Output Instance Example 

The reference URI returned by the WPS at the /ExecuteResponse/ 

Process/Metadata@href attribute provides a location from which the client can retrieve 

the SOS endpoint and all information needed to retrieve the changed video frames.  The 

schema for the response from this URI is shown in Figure 8 below. 

 

 

Figure 8 — Motion Video Change Detection Status Schema 

Although processing may not yet be complete, a changed frame can be accessed 

immediately through a GetObservation request after receiving the initial response from 

the WPS.  However, all fields will not be populated in the response.  But when change 

detection has completed the comparison of the streams, all elements will be populated 

including the end time.  As new change frames are inserted into the transactional SOS, 

the VideoEndTime will be updated.  This change in value can be used as a quick method 



OGC 10-036r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  11 
 

by the client to determine if additional changed frames have been inserted since the last 

check of the status. 

 

6.3 Motion Video Change Detection Computational Viewpoint 

The Computational Viewpoint is concerned with the functional decomposition of the 

system into a set of distinct components that interact at interfaces. 

For OGC, such components are generally realized as web services. The web services of 

principle concern in this exploration of the Motion Video Change Detection architecture 

are the Web Processing Service, Sensor Observation Services, and the SFE Integrated 

Client. 

Figure 9 is a wiring diagram showing how the Motion Video Change Detection WPS fits 

into the overall SFE architecture: 

 

Figure 9 — Wiring Diagram of overall Motion Video Change Detection Activity 

 

6.3.1 Web Processing Service 

For the OWS-7 test bed, George Mason University deployed a Web Processing Service 

(WPS) that takes two input video streams (archived and/or live), performs the change 

detection algorithm, and returns a status URL to the client through a standard WPS 



OGC 10-036r2 

12 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  
 

output response.  This status URL can then be polled to receive intermediate progress as 

well as a final status.  Each changed frame of the video will be pushed into the SOS-T 

and can be accessed immediately through a GetObservaion request to endpoint provided 

in the xml document found at the /ExecuteResponse/ Process/Metadata@href attribute 

within the WPS status responses.  When the streams are completely processed, the final 

status will be shown in the status response as well as the complete video timeframe will 

be available in the xml document containing the SOS information.   

6.3.2 Sensor Observation Service 

BIRI (using 52 North) deployed a Sensor Observation Services to provide video 

streaming services for the SFE thread of the OWS-7 testbed.  This Engineering Report 

will not detail this effort since the focus is on the Web Processing Service itself.  The 

request to the SOS to retrieve the two video streams serves as the inputs to the Motion 

Video Change Detection WPS. 

Compusult also provided, for the SFE thread of OWS-7, a Sensor Observation Service 

(Transactional) in which the frames containing changes could be inserted.  This service 

does play an integral part in the Change Detection algorithm in that it allows changed 

frames to be inserted into the SOS and are immediately made available without the need 

for the user to wait till the processing of the entire video is completed. 

6.3.3 SFE Integrated Client 

An Integrated Client was provided by BIRI to be used to drive the Change Detection 

process for OWS-7.  The client plays a vital role in the Change Detection process in that 

it is responsible for visualizing the process to the user.  It is responsible for obtaining the 

appropriate input video streams and ensuring the two streams overlap in track location 

and direction.  Once the WPS process begins, the client will poll for status and begin 

retrieving the changed frames from the SOS-T.  The client is then responsible for 

rendering the changed frames such that the user will not only see the changes but 

visualize them in the context of geographical location and time within the video.  More 

details about the client are provided in section 6.4.6. 

 

6.4 Motion Video Change Detection Engineering Viewpoint 

The Engineering Viewpoint describes specific components linked by a communications 

network and is concerned with the interaction of distinct computational objects. 

In the OWS-7 test bed, these are the components that played a role in the Motion Video 

Change Detection architecture experiment:

Services.

6.4.4 Execution Sample Response 

The following shows a sample response from to the Motion Video Change Detection 

WPS.  This response is returned immediately after the process execution is requested. 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

6.4.5 Status Response 

Once the above response is received, the client can continually request status through the 

link provided in the statusLocation attribute from the initial Execute response.  This 

status response will also contain the same statusLocation attribute for continuing to 

obtain status.  In addition, it will include a reference to an xml file from which 

information can be obtained to retrieve the changed frames from the SOS.  The following 

status requests will be responded to with a response similar to the following: 

 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

6.4.6 SOS Content Response 

When the initial WPS response or the Status response is received, a URL will be 

provided in the /ExecuteResponse/ Process/Metadata@href attribute that can be used to 

poll the service for information as to how to retrieve the updated video frames from the 

SOS.  Prior to any frames being processed, the referenced xml document will appear as 

follows: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 

<VideoChangeDetectionOutput xmlns="http://servername/wps/changedetection/output" 

xsi:schemaLocation="http://servername/wps/changedetection/output 



OGC 10-036r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  21 
 

http://servername/wpsr3/schemas/wps/changedetection/output.xsd" 

xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"> 

  

<ServiceEndPoint>http://sos_servername/SOS_WPS/GetObservation</ServiceEndPoint

> 

  <ServiceType>SOS</ServiceType> 

  <ServiceVersion>1.0.1</ServiceVersion> 

  <SensorId>urn:ogc:def:procedure:GMU::WPS</SensorId> 

  <ProcessId>1274841638790</ProcessId> 

  <StartTime/> 

  <EndTime/> 

  <VideoStartTime/> 

  <VideoEndTime/> 

</VideoChangeDetectionOutput> 

 

Note that several of the elements have yet to be populated.  After at least one frame has 

been processed, the SOS Content document will return a response similar to the 

following xml segment: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 

<VideoChangeDetectionOutput xmlns="http://servername/wps/changedetection/output" 

xsi:schemaLocation="http://servername/wps/changedetection/output 

http://servername/wpsr3/schemas/wps/changedetection/output.xsd" 

xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"> 

  

<ServiceEndPoint>http://sos_servername/SOS_WPS/GetObservation</ServiceEndPoint

> 

  <ServiceType>SOS</ServiceType> 

  <ServiceVersion>1.0.1</ServiceVersion> 

  <SensorId>urn:ogc:def:procedure:GMU::WPS</SensorId> 

  <ProcessId>1274841638790</ProcessId> 

  <StartTime>2010-05-26 00:28:01.0</StartTime> 

  <EndTime/> 

  <VideoStartTime>2010-04-14T17:12:27.000-05:00</VideoStartTime> 

  <VideoEndTime>2010-04-14T17:12:28.000-05:00</VideoEndTime> 

</VideoChangeDetectionOutput> 

Again, note that additional information such as the StartTime, VideoStartTime, and 

VideoEndTime have now been populated.  At this point, any changes can be accessed 

through the provided SOS.  As changed frames are inserted into the SOS-T, the 

VideoEndTime will be updated.  This allows the client to easily determine if additional 

changed frames have been inserted since the last status check.  After all frames have been 

processed, the final SOS Content document will be returned as follows: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

6.4.7 Presentation of Motion Video Change Detection in the SFE Client 

This section presents the handling of Motion Video Change Detection in the Integrated 

Client provided by BIRI. 

Once the client has been alerted by a Notification Service to the fact that an existing 

video track exists over the current path, it retrieves the two video streams from the 

appropriate SOS services as seen below: 

 

Figure 11 — Client Interface for Retrieving Video Streams 



OGC 10-036r2 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  23 
 

 

After selecting the two video streams, the user will select the Pick Begin Point button and 

then select the appropriate location on the track within the map view.  This process is 

then repeated for the ending point. 

 

Figure 12 — Client Interface for Picking Start and End Points 

 

After the begin and end points are selected, the user selects the Invoke WPS button to 

initiate the Change Detection WPS.  An immediate response from the WPS is received 

and a dialog displays the location of the WPS where the status can be checked.

Figure 13 — Client Dialog Showing WPS Submission 

 

The user will then poll the WPS for status.  Once complete, another dialog will be 

displayed show the completion of the process and the Video Start and End Times.

Figure 14 — Client Dialog Showing WPS Completion 

 

Once the Change Detection WPS finds changes, it inserts changed frames that highlight 

the changed pixels into an SOS.  The client will then pull those changed frames for 

display.

Figure 15 — Client Display Showing a Single Changed Frame 

 

In the example above, this changed frame is shown as a separate image but ultimately we 

would like to see the changed frame overlaid on the live video stream.
