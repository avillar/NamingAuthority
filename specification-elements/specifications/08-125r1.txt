i. Background 

In early 2007, Google proposed to the OGC that KML be submitted to the OGC to 
become an OGC standard. In June 2007, KML 2.1 was approved as an OGC best 
practice. The preamble to the document stated the reasons for KML becoming an OGC 
standard : 

1. That there be one international standard language for expressing geographic 
annotation and visualization on existing or future web-based online maps (2d) and 
earth browsers (3d). 

2. That KML be aligned with international best practices and standards, thereby 
enabling greater uptake and interoperability of earth browser implementations. 

3. That the OGC and Google will work collaboratively to insure that the KML 
implementer community is properly engaged in the process and that the KML 
community is kept informed of progress and issues. 

4. That the OGC process will be used to insure proper life-cycle management of the 
KML candidate specification, including such issues as backwards compatibility. 

In April 2008, KML 2.2 became an official OGC standard. In order to meet objective 4, 
the OGC and the Google KML community needed to define a procedure for life cycle 
management of the OGC KML standard.

ii. Preface 

This Best Practices Document provides guidance on the revision process for OGC KML. 
The intended audience is the OGC Mass Market Working Group (MMWG), current or 
future KML Standard Working Groups (SWG), and Technical Committee (TC) members 
as well as KML application developers and users with regards to progressing the OGC 
KML standard such that KML: 

• Remains true to its purpose: encoding the visualization and navigation of information 
within a geographic context for earth browser systems; 

• Is enhanced on the basis of proven extensions requested by the mass market; 

• Provides general solutions that meet end user performance expectations within 
current software and hardware limitations, with due consideration for legacy 
software/hardware; 

• Progresses on a regular and consistent revision cycle that assures the timely 
development of new applications required by the rapidly growing and changing mass 
market environment. 

The guidance is based on a well-received presentation given by OGC Member Google to 
the MMWG on past KML and earth browser development practices which proved 
successful to the growth and adoption of KML within the mass market community.  
Agreeing with the general process and principles described therein, the MMWG elected 
to summarize recommendations for continuing the successful evolution of the KML 
standard within a combined mass market and OGC framework.  The policies and 
procedures documented herein  are the result of those discussions.

Introduction 

The Free Dictionary defines mass market as, "of, relating to, or produced for 
consumption in large numbers …".  In this regard, KML is a mass market standard that 
facilitates the visualization and navigation of information within a geographic context. 

The current geo-mass market operating environment has the following characteristics: 

• Consists of millions of users, most of whom are non-experts with respect to the 
geospatial domain; 

• Using tens of millions of existing and indexed KML files and resources; 

• Within a large and growing list of earth browser applications; 

• On fairly average and diverse equipment, including the expanding use of mobile 
devices; 

• All of which is growing rapidly. 

To support this environment, KML has been developed to date according to a process and 
principles whereby the language: 

• Allows for unexpected and unintended uses; 

• Supports multi-purpose constructs and mechanisms; 

• Provides a core API that can be extended according to a well-defined model; 

• Is extended incrementally to support new mass market applications; 

• Changes formally only for those extensions that are proven through mass market 
adoption. 

The rapid and widespread uptake of KML by the mass market attests to the benefits of 
this approach and advocates for its continuation within OGC KML standardization 
processes.  As such, this document provides guidance on assuring similar success in the 
progression of the OGC KML standard.

6 KML development process 

6.1 overview 

KML was historically developed by cycling through the following development phases: 

• respond to the wisdom of the masses as to what new functionality KML should support; 

• build the new functionality as running code; 

• assure its compatibility and performance; 

• specify the KML language extension to support it; 

• release the KML extension API and application(s) built upon it; 

• measure its utility via usage statistics, performance metrics, and user feedback; 

• formalize it within the core language only if proven to be of general, popular, and 
effective use.

6.2 development phases 

6.2.1 respond 

As with any successful social or commercial enterprise, KML has evolved according to the 
needs of its user base.  The mass market geo community continues to express its wants and 
needs via bulletin boards, blogs, forums, community projects, and the OGC Mass Market 
Working Group, amongst other feedback mechanisms.  Developing KML in response to 
current and predominant mass market application requirements will continue to assure its 
value and relevancy. 

6.2.2 build 

An overriding principle for any KML development is that the proof is in its application.  
Coding ideas early in the revision process helps to determine whether new concepts and 
extensions can be effectively built and integrated into existing applications while still 
meeting new requirements. 

6.2.3 assure 

The following questions should be addressed when designing and implementing any KML 
extension: 

• Are old implementations well behaved (e.g. stable) when faced with new KML extension 
data?   There is an assumption that  a significant percentage of existing KML 
implementations may never be upgraded.  

• Are new implementations friendly to existing data?  Assume old data exists forever and 
can never be changed. 

In this regard, backward compatibility of any new KML data with respect to existing and 
limited clients is a paramount goal.  In practice this means KML development should focus 
on incremental enhancements, rather than refactoring or redesign. 

KML enhancements should also consider forward compatibility in their design by facilitating 
the graceful handling of new components by old clients. 

6.2.4 specify 

To support adoption and 3rd party usage, a KML extension should be well defined within an 
API specification document, and include sample files that demonstrate: 

• normal or intended uses; 

• any known edge cases and their recommended handling; 

• integration with existing core KML;

• integration with the KML update mechanism (see kml:Update in OGC KML Standard). 
Such documentation should be understandable to the average, non-expert user. 

6.2.5 release 

Release the KML extension API, samples, and application(s) built upon it.  Promote 
experimentation and seek feedback. 

6.2.6 measure 

Record user feedback and usage statistics to help determine adoption rate and performance 
results. Pay attention to the handling of ‘edge cases’ i.e. combinations of extreme or omitted 
element values (e.g. geometry near poles or antemeridian) and revisit design, if necessary, to 
mitigate any unforeseen negative results. 

6.2.6.1 adoption 

As mass market usage is an overriding indicator of the significance and utility of a KML 
extension, adoption rates should be measured and made accessible for verification. 

6.2.6.2 performance 

Application performance is a predominant goal.  In practice, this means KML evolution 
should focus on solutions that meet end user performance expectations within current 
software and hardware limitations. 

Performance requirements should not exceed common hardware devices of non-expert users.  
Such devices increasingly include mobile clients. 

Important considerations affecting the design, implementation, and/or standardization of any 
KML enhancement include: 

• How does the enhancement behave on weak, limited, and/or mobile devices? 

• How much texture memory does the enhancement require?  How many clients right 
now have this much? What happens to those that still have old gear? 

Performance statistics should be accessible for those exemplar applications using the new 
KML extension. 

6.2.6.3 edge cases 

KML enhancements should minimize the possibility of encoding any ambiguous, extreme, or 
meaningless values.  Where this is not possible, facilitating graceful degradation within 
encodings and clients is encouraged. 

https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=27810


OGC® 08-125r1 

8 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 

Exemplar applications using the KML extension should test any and all known edge cases 
using representative sample files. 

6.2.7 formalize 

Formalization of a new KML extension can occur as a last step when and where it: 

• adheres to the requirements of the existing OGC KML standard; 

• adheres to the best practices outlined in this document as much as possible; 

• provides a satisfactory and general solution for the new functionality it provides; 

• has proven itself useful through adoption within the mass market; 

• would enhance the core KML language; 

• is formally offered to the OGC for standardization by the owning party or parties. This 
includes a commitment to assign any existing intellectual property associated with the 
extension to the OGC. 

The OGC KML standard follows a certain architecture that should persist within KML 
extensions and enhancements in order to maintain stable application development, facilitate 
the reuse of existing client code, and ease the understanding of new components.

7 OGC KML standardization 

7.1 overview 

While the OGC is now the owner and forum for enhancing the KML standard, the mass 
market itself remains the de facto place for KML application development and therefore 
those KML extensions that support them. 

Natural stages and roles exist within the overall progression of KML, as shown in the 
following diagram. 

 

Figure 2 ·· KML evolution 

7.2 KML progression 

For simplicity of discussion, the KML development phases are summarized into three 
general progression stages as follows: 



OGC® 08-125r1 

10 Copyright © 2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 

• extension ·· This includes the respond, build, assure, specify, and release activities.  
The outcome is a KML extension API and application(s) built upon it.  Such 
development is expected to be performed by individual vendors or organizations, 
although discussion amongst groups during such development is encouraged. 

• adoption ·· Uptake within and by the mass market of a KML extension API and 
originating and 3rd party applications built upon it.  Performance and most critically 
adoption rates should be measured to support assessment of the extension within the 
standardization process. 

• standardization ·· Formalize proven KML extensions as enhancements to the core KML 
language.  The OGC MMWG should provide guidance on priority enhancements, while 
the KML SWG conducts the technical evaluation and integration of such enhancements 
into the KML standard, ATS, and schema. 

• A key requirement of the standardization process is that the developers of the 
enhancement and/or extension submit an official OGC Change request into the OGC 
process. These change requests are public and may be submitted into the OGC process 
using the public CR submission form at <new url>.  The  developer may also submit a 
Change Request via the work done in the MMWG. However, CR submitted as part of 
normal OGC activities will also be publicly available. 

• PLEASE NOTE: No new extension or enhancement to KML will be considered for a 
revision to the OGC KML standard unless a CR is submitted! 



OGC® 08-125r1

7.3 roles 

7.3.1 KML users 

The KML user community serves as the hub of mass market geo ideation, experimentation, 
and adoption.  It includes your average Geo, not your average Geo, non-profits, academic 
institutions, corporations, and public agencies who are creating and/or using KML.  In short, 
almost anyone anywhere involved with the visualization of information within a geographic 
context. 

7.3.2 KML application providers 

KML application providers include the larger earth browser providers, 3rd party application 
developers, GIS software vendors, mobile providers, and others.  As they develop and 
provide earth browser functionality to KML users they are best able to extend KML to meet 
new user requirements for earth browser technologies. 

7.3.3 OGC MMWG 

The MMWG, as a representative body for the mass market community, is best able to 
oversee the long-term development of the OGC KML standard.  It represents a valuable 
forum for discussing feature requests and KML extensions that could satisfy them.  There is 
likely also a role for the MMWG to advise on the prioritization of KML enhancements for 
standardization, and to arbitrate between any similar proposed enhancements. 

7.3.4 OGC KML SWG 

An OGC KML SWG best able to: 

• establish a discrete charter with specific standardization objectives; 

• assure a regular, timely and responsive KML development schedule; 

• evaluate official OGC change requests and integrate proven KML extensions according 
to established standardization criteria; 

• document any and all changes within a new KML standard revision (Revision notes). 

To better perform these tasks, KML SWG members should preferably have mass market geo 
presence; participate actively in the MMWG; have technical expertise in KML applications 
and extensions; and remain actively involved in the KML SWG process.

7.4 KML SWG process guidelines 

All revisions to the OGC KML standard shall use the same revision policies and procedures 
as detailed in the OGC Technical Committee Policies and Procedures. The following is a 
synopsis of additional guidance for the processing of the OGC KML standard for formal 
approval as an official OGC revision. 

7.4.1 charter 

A KML SWG should assure that KML remains true to its purpose: encoding the presentation 
and navigation of information within a geographic context. 

The charter for KML SWGs should respect the KML development best practices outlined in

A KML SWG should focus on incrementally enhancing the KML standard by evaluating and 
integrating KML extensions that have already been proven in the mass marketplace. 

Only if there is sufficiently valuable and well-defined mass market needs for an application 
that cannot be accommodated by the current language primitives, shall a backwards-
incompatible revision be contemplated.  It is expected that the MMWG will advise on both 
the need and timing for any such major revision. 

7.4.2 timeline 

KML should evolve in a manner that satisfies the mass market need for regular and 
incremental enhancements of functionality.  In practice this means a KML SWG should limit 
its scope of work to that which can be achieved within at most an annual release cycle. 

A regular and consistent KML revision cycle will help to assure commercial development of 
earth browser technologies and applications within the rapidly changing mass market geo 
environment. 

7.4.3 standardization criteria 

A KML extension should be evaluated on the basis of how well it: 

• is consistent with the purpose, architecture, and requirements of KML; 

• is consistent with the KML standard development best practices; 

• enables new mass market application(s) that are otherwise not supported by the existing 
KML core primitives; 

• is proven through significant and verifiable adoption within the mass market; 

• provides a general solution that meets end user performance expectations within current 
software and hardware limitations;

• is backwards compatible with previous minor KML revisions; 

• includes a change request document meeting OGC requirements, as well as a set of test 
files for normal, edge, and update cases. 

A KML SWG should assure backwards compatibility by testing against a normative set of 
KML test files.  The normative set should include instances for all previous KML versions, 
starting with KML 2.1.  The test coverage will naturally expand over time as a result of 
ongoing KML revisions.  The KML SWG may additionally elect to test the compatibility 
using a reference KML parser such as the open-source libkml library. 

7.4.4 KML enhancement 

When enhancing the core KML language, a KML SWG should integrate an acceptable KML 
extension with as little disruption as possible to existing users and applications of KML as 
well as the extension itself.  In practice this means using the same KML extension element 
and attribute names and structures as much as possible. 

A new KML standard revision should address necessary changes to the KML standard, 
abstract test suite, and XML schema to incorporate the enhancement. 

7.4.4.1 versioning 

An incremental enhancement shall result in a minor revision of the KML Standard, i.e. 
X.Y+1; everything that validates against x.y shall validate against X.Y+n 

A small, immediate and necessary fix to the KML Standard or XML schema shall result in a 
bug fix revision of the Standard, i.e. X.Y.Z+1; everything that validates against X.Y.Z 
shall validate against X.Y.Z+n, excepting those instances that are invalid with respect to the 
fixes themselves.  X.Y.Z+n shall not introduce any new functionality from X.Y.Z 

A backwards-incompatible revision shall result in a major revision of the KML Standard, i.e. 
X+1.0.0  Major revisions are expected to rarely occur. 

7.4.5 public comment 

Draft KML enhancements must be posted for a 30 day public comment as per OGC SWG 
requirements.  Feedback should be evaluated within the context of the standardization 
criteria. 

7.4.6 KML revision 

A KML revision, encompassing a new KML standard document, abstract test suite, and 
XML schema, must receive approval by the OGC Technical Committee (TC) before it is 
released as the next KML standard.
