OfferedCoverage is a coverage 

as specified in the GML 

Application Schema for 

Coverages [OGC 09-146r1] and 

the further standards referenced 

therein." but this is confusing 

when looking at the UML which 

shows an OfferedCoverage 

containing an accessor to a 

coverage rather than being a 

coverage. -- PeterBaumann - 12

71                 what about these names: 

TooManyAxesForEncoding, 

TooManyRangeComponentsFor

Encoding, 

RangeComponentTypeIllegalFor

Encoding, UndefinedParameter. 

Reason: Similar errors occur in 

WCPS (and probably other 

extensions), but with operations 

other than format encoding, and 

then the naming gets ambiguous. 

Further, I'd like to reinterpret 

UnsupportedDimension as 

AxisIllegalForEncoding 

meaning that "at least one axis is 

not supported by the format 

chosen", such as z/t for 

GeoTIFF? . -- PeterBaumann -

Status  Priority  Severity  Section  Description  Comments 

19  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement 9 Since 'request 

type' is not defined term in the 

standard, this requirement 

probably needs to be rephrased 

to something like: All WCS 

requests must use a data 

structure which is a subtype of 

RequestBase? .  

  

20  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Section 8.1, second sentence Is 

not a sentence. "The definition 

is based..."? "Their definitions 

are based..."? "All three 

operations use the GML..."?  

  



OGC 12-052 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 5 
 

21  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Section 8.2 The first sentence 

"A GetCapabilities? operation 

... allows a WCS client to 

retrieve ... and coverages..." 

probably needs to be re-written.  

  

22  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement 12 violates 

Requirement 9 Since, as shown 

in figure 5, wcs:GetCaps does 

not extend RequestBase? . 

Either an exception needs to be 

made in Req. 9 or the root of 

Fig 5 should be RequestBase? .  

  

23  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Figure 6 and Table 8 seem 

wrong It seems that you are 

intentionally making a 

departure from the OWS 

Common design in Figure~6 

without sufficient explanation. 

You have your Contents next to 

your ServiceMetadata? whereas 

ows:ServiceMetadata is 

supposed to contain the 

contents section (see OWS 

Common, Fig~3, p24). The 

reasons for this need to be 

explained and you need to state 

how WCS services are to 

handle the ows:Contents 

(wcs:Capabilities.ows:ServiceM

etadata.ows:Contents) defined 

in the UML diagrams but left 

out of the XSD Schema. (I 

presume you must be aware that 

the planned mechanism for 

doing this is to use directly the 

inherited elements of 

wcs:Capabilities rather than 

duplicating those elements in a 

second element, 

wcs:ServiceMetadata, which 

also inherits from 

ows:CapabilitiesBaseType. I am 

unclear what you are working 

around in using your 

duplication mechanism.) 

Also, since the 

ServiceMetadata? element 

should be a wcs:Capabilities 

element directly since it 

contains the 'extension' element. 

I do not know how, in UML, 

you indicate that this element 

extends the abstract 

ows:ServiceMetadata element; 

it is really the type that extends 

the ows type. 

Similarly, the Contents element 

is really a wcs:Contents element 

and it needs to show the 

IMHO this 

mixes Metadata 

and 

ServiceMetadat

a? ; WCS Core 

Fig 6 uses 

Metadata, for 

which OWS 

Common Fig 7 

(p 35) applies. 

UML class 

"Contents" 

indeed is in the 

(default) 

namespace of 

WCS, as 

requested by 

you.

extension addition of 

wcs:CoverageSummary (and 

show the dependence of the 

type of wcs:Contents on the 

ows:ContentsBaseType which, 

again, I do not know how to do 

in UML). 

Note, in passing, an erratum in 

the XML Schema annotation: 

"COverage" line~57, 

wcsGetCapabilities.xsd. 

Also, since wcs:Contents 

extends ows:ContentsBaseType 

which has an 

ows:DatasetDescriptionSummar

y element but you want servers 

to use your 

wcs:CoverageSummary element 

instead, you have to enjoin what 

happens to the existing 

ows:DatasetDescriptionSummar

y element (i.e. do not use it). 

Would it not have been possible 

to put your 

wcs:CoverageSummary into a 

substitution group for 

ows:DatasetDescriptionSummar

y? 

24  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  last paragraph on page 12, and 

sub-clauses (a), (b), and (c) p13 

(a) "is renamed" seems to 

indicate a relation but there is 

no formal relation; perhaps you 

are trying to say that there is a 

semantic parallel between the 

roles of the two. Really, 

wcs:Contents has: wcs:Contents 

ows:DatasetDescriptionSummar

y ows:otherSource 

wcs:CoverageSummary rather 

than having 

wcs:CoverageSummary 

substitute for 

ows:DatasetDescriptionSummar

y. (b) "CoverageSummary" is 

extended (over 

DatasetSummary? )" but it does 

not really 'extend' rather it 

follows a somewhat similar 

structure (notably lacking the 

recursion mechanism) (c) since 

wcs:CoverageSummary is 

totally independent from the 

ows:DatasetDescriptionSummar

y and there is no inherited 

'identifier', I do not understand 

why this sub-clause is needed; it 

seems to confuse more than aid.  

what is 

described in 

said text portion 

follows what is 

stated in OWS 

Common. 



OGC 12-052 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 7 
 

25  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  the UML in Figure~7 probably 

needs clarification. The 

wcs:Contents element probably 

needs an annotation stating 

what happens to its 

datasetSummary (i.e. it must be 

null). 

 

        

         

26  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Note (p14 top), second sentence 

OWS Common D.9 does not 

really describe 'proper use of 

the many *optional elements*' 

so I am not sure what this 

sentence is trying to say.  

It does not fully 

describe indeed, 

so the reference 

has been 

generalized to 

the full scope of 

OWS Common 

27  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement 14 Since you have 

explicitly defined wcs:Contents 

to use your 

wcs:CoverageSummary rather 

than the ows:DatasetSummary 

of OWS Common this 

injunction seems problematic.  

phrasing 

improved to 

avoid 

ambiguity. 

28  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Section 8.2.4 The reference 

should probably be to ows-7.4.1 

not the huge 7.4  

  

29  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Section 8.3 Note the style has it 

using a smaller font than the 

lower order section 8.2.4 above 

which seems weird. 

Also both notes on 

wcs:CoverageSummary need 

clarification: since it does not 

extend DatasetSumary? (UML) 

or 

DatasetDescriptionSummary? 

(XSD) it does not have any 

@identifier and the note at the 

bottom says 'is cloned from' but 

that seems too strong a 

relationship for merely being 

inspired by. 

"A DescribeCoverage? request 

... returns ... a description" 

needs cleanup since 

grammatically this suggests the 

request that is returning 

something. 

The NOTE is fine but observe 

that it directly contradicts the 

earlier comment discussed in 

 



OGC 12-052 

8 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

my point 16 above. 

30  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement~17 Would it be 

better to replace "shall consist 

of a structure" with something 

like "shall contain the semantic 

elements defined in"?  

ok, but different 

solution adopted 

31  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Requirement~18 (also 17, 12, 

and other referring to request) 

This highlights issues with the 

formulation of injunctions on 

client requests, we need to think 

about flexible handling of such 

requests. This injunction seems 

more about the 'validity' of the 

request and implicitly about 

server handling of invalid 

requests. Based on req.20, it 

seems that this is really stating 

that servers receiving a request 

with an unknown id shall 

consider the request invalid and, 

I presume, issue an error of 

some kind. Through that 

formulation, we have turned the 

requirement from a client 

requirement to a server 

requirement.  

My philosophy 

is that an 

interface 

describes 

interaction 

between two 

parties, hence I 

find this 

phrasing more 

appropriate. 

32  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement~19 "of a 

CoverageDescriptions? 

*element*" for grammatical 

coherence.  

  

34  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Table~10 The Data type of 

CoverageId? (a list) conflicts 

with the name (singular) and 

duplicates the multiplicity of 

the element. Are you really 

expecting to get multiple lists of 

coverageIds? 

Is version fixed to 2.x.x here? 

Also compare this injunction to 

that of Table~6, p10. 

Also, why repeat the definition 

of the elements of 

RequestBase? which were 

specified in Table~6? 

coverageId: 

fixed. Version 

string: I find it 

problematic to 

hardwaire 

versions in 

manifold places 

in the spec. 

Version def in 

Table 6: fixed. 

35  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement~20 Does this 

imply that a DescribeCoverage? 

request with 0 coverages is 

invalid and the server should 

return an exception rather than 

an empty list?  

yes, coverage 

ids are 

considered 

invalid. Have 

added exception 

code for 

clarification.

get the relation of Fig~1 to this

could this not state "...a

information appropriate for the

this sentence is too long and 

needs to be split into more 

understandable pieces. 

        

39  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  NOTE p19 Is this true of the 

domainSet element in particular 

or can all elements be included 

by reference? Also, this 

probably needs a better 

explanation about how the 

resolution mechanism would 

work, something like: 1. the 

href would be a, presumably 

full not relative, HTTP URL, 2. 

a request for an xml document 

could be made to that URL, 3. 

the response to that request 

would be an XML document 

with a GML domainSet as the 

root element (not sure if this is 

allowed).

41a  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Requirement 23 Since table 13

would be better to seprate out

normal  normal  ?  Last paragraph, p20 This states 

that trim must have bounds 

"which both must lie inside the 

coverage's domain" but the first 

paragraph of section 8.4 ends 

by talking about "intersection of 

the request envelope with the 

coverage envelope": which 

behaviour is supported? Req.30 

and 31 suggests it must be 

inside. (Same goes for slice at 

top of p.21) I guess it is the 

introductory paragraph to 

section~8.4 which should be 

corrected. 

Last sentence should start "The 

dimension of the result*ing* 

coverage..." ( although 

'returned', 'derived', or 

'delivered' might be better than 

'resulting'). 

 

43  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  First paragraph, p21 "the 

operand coverage" is a poor 

formulation, use 'offered' 

instead?

probably implicit, would be 

better called 'fixed' and

49  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Last paragraph, p22 The "of a

needs to be more specific. Is 

this the CoverageDescription? 

:BoundedBy element? Or is that 

boundedBy element merely the 

same as that of another 

BoundedBy? element in the 

offered coverage? Short of 

asking for the coverage without

poorly constructed. The

possibly only in extensions but I 

suspect this could be done in a

55  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Second NOTE, p24 Has this not 

already been stated above in the 

second paragraph of Clause 1 

'Scope' p1?  

yes, for better 

understanding; 

NOTEs are 

informal 

explanations. 

56  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement 34 change to 

"...shall consist of the coverage 

component of the 

OfferedCoverage? identified by 

that id..."?  

  

57  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Section 8.4.2.2 example It 

would be better to have an 

example with realistic values in 

the TuleList? such as 22 23 22 

25 18 25 22 23 19 19 20 21 24

IMHO the

allow to better 

understand the

58  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Requirement 35 The definitions 

probably need to be part of the

'Let' at the top of the page.

with "dimensions of c minus 1"  

  

60  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Requirement~38 Again, the last 

sentence probably belongs as 

part of the middle condition 

rather than being applied, at the 

end, apparently to all 

exceptions.  

  

61  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Table~18 The HTTP code is 

probably not the good one. 

These are invalid requests not 

unknown endpoints. 404 would 

only make sense in the first case 

'NoSuchCoverage', but even 

that is debatable.  

I cannot find a 

more suitable 

HTTP code. 

Hm, we may 

consider 418? 

62  2.0.1  moot  normal  normal  ?  Section 8.5 Is uniqueness of 

identifiers ever formally stated 

as a requirement?  

The testable 

equivalent of 

this is stated in 

Req 39. 

63  2.0.1  rejected  normal  normal  ?  Requirement~39 Since services 

can be transactional, this 

implicitly requires that 

identifiers not be reused else a 

request on one operation, 

followed by a transaction, 

followed by a request on 

another operation might violate 

this rule. If this analysis is right, 

it should be made part formally 

UUID is a fixed 

term, cannot be 

reused here 

because 

semantics is not 

identical. While 

not reusing 

identifiers is 

best practice it 

is not

of the uniqueness requirement 

discussed in my comment 60. 

The subsequent NOTE should 

therefore be dropped, especially 

so since it conflicts with the 

paragraph immediately below. I 

think you need to call 

CoverageId? values Universally 

Unique Id's (UUID).  

expressible (ie, 

cannot be 

tested) in the 

framework of 

WCS. Have 

added a NOTE 

on this. 

64  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  Section 9 This should probably 

read something like: The 

specification contained in this 

WCS Core is not sufficient for a 

concrete WCS implementation. 

This Clause describes 

extensions to the core standard 

which could be combined with 

the core specification to 

constitute the full specification 

of a minimal WCS-conformant 

implementation. 

However, given Requirements 

41 and 42, this second sentence 

is actually not true. 

suitably adapted 

65  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  first sentence, p29 erratum: 

"...can verify the 

implementation..." but this 

could be better stated in terms 

of a client determining that a 

particular instance implements 

each extension by finding the 

relevant URI in one of the 

Profile elements.

sequel" means what?  

  

67  2.0.1  obsoleted  normal  normal  ?  requirement 40 This does not 

appear to be an extension but to 

be part of core.  

requirement 

deleted 

68  2.0.1  included   normal  normal  ?  second NOTE, p29 This might 

mention that the role of Profiles 

could be to specify mandatory 

bindings.  

  

69  2.0.1  obsoleted  normal  normal  ?  Requirement 42 Why does the 

form of this requirement not 

follow that of the similar 

requirement 41? Also what is 

"the Coverage Format 

Extension"? I suspect the URI 

is a root rather than a full URI. 

Ah, the NOTE seems to 

indicate that (1) there is a 

document where this is 

specified and (2) all servers 

must implement this. If so, then 

requirement 

removed 

altogether
