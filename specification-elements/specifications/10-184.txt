Preface 

Making new connections in existing data is a powerful method to gain understanding of 
the world.  Such fusion of data is not a new topic but new technology provides 
opportunities to enhance this ubiquitous process.  Data fusion in distributed information 
environments with interoperability based on open standards is radically changing the 
classical domains of data fusion while inventing entirely new ways to discern 
relationships in data with little structure.   Associations based on locations and times are 
of the most primary type.   

This Engineering Report summarizes two phases of the Open Geospatial Consortium 
(OGC®) Fusion Standards study and of the fusion prototypes developed during the 
OWS-7 Testbed which occurred between the two study phases.  Recommendations from 
the first phase of the study were implemented in OWS-7.  Based upon the results of 
OWS-7, responses to two Requests for Information and a multi-day workshop, this report 
provides a cumulative set of recommendations for advancing fusion based on open 
standards.  

This Study was based on requirements and contributions from OGC Member 
organizations – in particular the National Geospatial-intelligence Agency. 

In the context of this study, Data Fusion is defined as:   

“the act or process of combining or associating data or information regarding one 
or more entities considered in an explicit or implicit knowledge framework to 
improve one’s capability (or provide a new capability) for detection, identification, 
or characterization of that entity”.  

Three categories were used to organize this study: Observation (sensor) fusion, 
Object/Feature fusion, and Decision fusion. The study considered classical fusion as 
exemplified by the JDL and OODA models as well as how fusion is achieved by new 
technology such as web-based mash-ups and mobile Internet.  The study considers both 
OGC standards – such as the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) – as well open 
standards from other standards organizations.  These technologies and standards aid in 
bringing structure to unstructured data as well as enabling a major new thrust in Decision 
Fusion. 

This study addressed many challenging issues with a potentially enormous scope.  The 
recommendations summarized in Section 7, identify future work, which in OGC means 
both specifications and prototyping.  Elements of this study will be implemented in future 
OWS Testbeds.  If your organization has an interest in data fusion, you are encouraged to 
contact OGC and join this association based on open standards.

OGC® Fusion Standards Study, Phase 2 Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 
1.1 Scope 
This OGC Engineering Report (ER) provides discussions and recommendations for data 
fusion, with a focus on geospatial information.  In this ER, fusion is discussed in three 
categories: observation (sensor) fusion, object/feature fusion, and decision fusion.  
Recommendations in this ER will be considered in the planning of future activities 
including OWS Testbeds. 

The OGC Interoperability Program utilizes a multi-step methodology in defining an 
interoperability initiative.  Part one of the methodology is Concept Development which 
may use an RFI to gain better understanding of the current state of a given technology 
thrust and discover stakeholder insights about the architecture(s) to be used in subsequent 
testbeds.  Subsequent steps of the methodology include development of recommendations 
from the concept development study. 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium Inc. shall not be held 
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of 
any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be 
aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this 
document, and to provide supporting documentation. 

1.2 The Open Geospatial Consortium  
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international not for profit voluntary 
industry consensus standards organization that provides a forum and proven processes for 
the collaborative development of free and publicly available interface specifications 
(open standards).  These open standards enable easier access to and use of geospatial 
information and improved interoperability of geospatial technologies (across any device, 
platform, system, network or enterprise) to meet the needs of the global community.  
OGC open standards have been implemented broadly in the marketplace and are helping 
to foster distributed and component technology solutions that geo-enable web, wireless, 
and location based services as well as broader government and business IT enterprises 
worldwide. 

To accomplish the mission of the Consortium, OGC conducts three programs: 

• OGC’s Specification Program facilitates formal consensus-based committees, 
working groups and special interest groups that establish a forum for OGC’s industry, 
academic/research and user community members to collaboratively identify, 
prioritize and advance solutions to meet standards needs of the global community.   



OGC 10-184

• OGC’s Interoperability Program promotes rapid prototyping, testing and validation of 
emerging standards through fast paced testbeds, experiments, pilot initiatives and 
related feasibility studies.   

• OGC’s Outreach and Community Adoption Program conducts programs (training, 
articles in publications, workshops, conferences, etc) to promote awareness and 
implementation of OGC standards across the global community.  

This ER was developed as part of the OWS-7 Concept Development initiative that is an 
element of the OGC Interoperability Program.  The initiative was based upon interest and 
contributions from several OGC Member organizations, including, the National 
Geospatial-intelligence Agency (NGA) and Lockheed Martin.

5 Fusion Standards Study 
5.1 Objectives of the Study - Standards Based Fusion 
Fusion Standards Goal: The sponsor’s goal for the fusion standards study is to define 
and develop fusion standards to give analysts an environment where they can use 
interoperable tools to analyze, process and exploit two or more different types of data or 
products from the same or multiple sensors and databases utilizing just one system. 

Fusion Objectives from the NGA InnoVision R&D Portfolio: Developing new or 
exploiting current capabilities for fusing information from multiple sensors, from 
multiple sources, and from multiple INTs in ways that dramatically improve the ability to 
detect, indentify, locate, and track objects. Research addresses fusing information from 
different sensors of the same modality, fusing information from IMINT sensors of 
different modalities (e.g. fusing LIDAR, hyperspectral, and OPIR), fusing information 
from different INTs (e.g. fusing IMINT and SIGINT), fusing disparate GEOINT data 
types, developing new ways to reason and make decisions from fused information, and 
providing fusion-based solutions to hard problems in a net-centric environment. The 
research also addresses measurements and databases for fused and composite signatures 
of targets of interest, conflation of multi-sensor, multi-modality data, and development of 
automated fusion exploitation algorithms for hard problems. 

This study considers information technology standards – for data and services – 
supporting situations characterized by information from multi-sources of intelligence; 
some highly structured, others highly unstructured and open; where the situations include 
the need for analysis and decision in an ambiguous and possibly urgent environment 
based on partially complete assessment of the situation. 

Previous studies of fusion process have identified a need for standards: 

“Developing a system that utilizes existing or developmental data fusion 
technology requires a standard method for specifying data fusion 
processing and control functions, interfaces, and associated data bases. 
The lack of common engineering standards for data fusion systems has 
been a major impediment to integration and re-use of available 
technology.”   [Steinberg, Bowman, & White, 1999]1 

The OGC Reference Model provides a discussion of the benefits of open standards along 
with several examples. [OGC, 2008] 

5.2 Standards Based Fusion  
Fusion is not a new topic.  Many of the fusion processes described in this Engineering 
Report can be achieved in closed architectures with existing single provider software and 
hardware solutions. The objective addressed by this Engineering Report is to move those 
capabilities into a distributed architecture based upon open standards including standards 
for security, authorization, and rights management.  The objective is to move from the 
“As-Is” state to the “Target” state:

OGC 10-184 

8 Co

As-Is State: Lack of identified and adopted standards results in multiple islands of 
data and stovepipe applications and services that are difficult to automate and 
scale for large data volumes and challenging analytical problems. 

Target State: Standards-based data, applications and services enable an automated 
and interoperable fusion environment supporting secure sharing of data and 
transparent reuse of “pluggable” services for handling large data volumes and 
unanticipated analytical challenges. 

Establishing a framework of open standards for data fusion environments will enable 
functional and programmatic developments for fusion beyond the current state of data 
fusion.  Functional expansion will include fusion in manual and semi-automated 
multi-INT visualization and analysis as a preferred practice among analysts.  Open 
standards will enable multiple fusion R&D projects with diverse technical approaches 
to collaborate.   R&D prototypes can be enhanced for improve operational capability 
including improved access to data, integration of diverse inputs and value-added 
applications. 

As described in The Importance of Going Open – an OGC White Paper – non- 
interoperability impedes the sharing of data and the sharing of computing resources, 
causing organizations to spend much more than necessary on geospatial information 
technology development.  For OGC, “Open” Standard means that the document is freely 
and publicly available in a non-discriminatory fashion with no license fee, vendor and 
data neutral, and agreed to by a formal consensus process. 

Some elements of the desired open standards-based fusion framework are pervasive now.  
The OGC Web Map Service (WMS) enables fusion of maps.  WMS allows for maps as 
pictorial layers from different sources to be geographically-overlaid to create a composite 
map suitable to the user’s need (Figure 1).   

  
Figure 1 - Examples of Fusion based on OGC WMS standard 

Further development of the open-standards fusion framework is needed and is defined in 
the remainder of this ER.  The results will include:  

• Rapidly deployable interoperable tools to analyze, process and exploit two or 
more different types of data or products from the same or multiple sensors 

• Develop new or further exploiting current capabilities for fusing information 
from, multiple sensors, multiple sources, and multiple INTs in ways that 
dramatically improve the ability to detect, identify, locate, and track objects.

5.3 Phases of the Study  
The OGC Fusion Standards Study was conducted in two phases that were linked with the 
OWS-7 and OWS-8 Testbeds: 

• Phase 1 of the Study began with public announcement of a Request for 
Information (RFI-1).  Ten organizations responded to RFI-1.  An Engineering 
Report based on the RFI-1 responses was publically issued. [OGC, 2009] 

• OWS-7 Testbed took up several of the recommendations from the Phase 1 Study 
ER (ER-1).  The OWS-7 Testbed was conducted in 2010 and produced 
implementations, demonstrations and Engineering Reports.  OWS-7 focused on 
recommendations.  OWS-7 results are summarized in this ER for Phase 2 study 
(ER-2) in particular regarding observation fusion and feature fusion. 

• Phase 2 of the Study included an RFI for Decision Fusion, Responses to the RFI, 
a two-day workshop and this ER.  The workshop was - hosted by Intergraph 
Corporation – was held on August 10 and 11, 2010. 

• The OWS-8 Testbed is being planned concurrently with the development of this 
ER-2.  The Recommendations contained in this ER-2 are being considered for 
implementation in OWS-8.

6 Definition and Categories of Fusion 
Data Fusion as defined for this study is: 

“Fusion is the act or process of combining or associating data or information 
regarding one or more entities considered in an explicit or implicit knowledge 
framework to improve one’s capability (or provide a new capability) for detection, 
identification, or characterization of that entity” [OGC, 2009].  

Three categories of data fusion (Figure 2) were used to organize the study:  
1) Observation (sensor) Fusion,  
2) Object/Feature Fusion, and  
3) Decision Fusion.  

A fundamental notion in any type of data fusion is the construction of associations 
between one or more data elements.  In many cases this association may also involve 
additional processing and abstraction and result in a new type of data element. This 
notion leads to categories of data fusion based on the type of the data elements being 
associated: fusion of observations, fusion of features/objects, and fusion of decisions. 

Typically “sensor fusion” has been used to label the fusion of observations.  Observation 
fusion is more accurate and is the preferred term going forward.  Object/Feature Fusion is 
more problematic as the two terms have different meanings in the historically separate 
domains of image processing and GIS.  

Multiple organizations and authors have offered categorization schemes for fusion. The 
three categories used in this ER have been found in publications extending back to 1974 
[Wald, 1998].  For example these fusion categories was used in [Dasarathy, 1994].  Other 
approaches to fusion categories – in particular the JDL approach – are discussed later in 
this document.

Definitions for the three categories of Fusion used in this Engineering Report are: 

• Observation (sensor) Fusion: Fusion processes involve merging of multiple 
sensor measurements of the same phenomena (i.e., events of feature of interest) 
into a combined observation; and analysis of the measurement signature. Fusion 
ranging from sensor measurements of various observable properties to well 
characterized observations including uncertainties. 

• Object/Feature Fusion: includes processing of observations into higher order 
semantic features and feature processing.  Object/feature fusion improves 
understanding of the operational situation and assessment of potential threats and 
impacts to identify, classify, associate and aggregate entities of interest.  
Object/feature fusion processes include generalization and conflation of features.   

• Decision fusion:  the act or process of supporting a human’s ability to make a 
decision by providing an environment of interoperable network services for 
situation assessment, impact assessment and decision support, using information 
from multiple sensors, processed information, e.g., multi-INT sources. 

These categories of fusion are useful but are not completely distinct.  Assigning a fusion 
process to a specific category is done as a convenience for explanation in this 
Engineering Report and should not be considered a normative classification scheme.

8 Decision Fusion  
8.1 Introduction 
The definition of decision fusion used in this study is: 

Decision fusion is the act or process of supporting a human’s ability to make a 
decision by providing an environment of interoperable network services for 
situation assessment, impact assessment and decision support, using information 
from multiple sensors, processed information, e.g., multi-INT sources. 

Decision Fusion provides analysts an environment where they can – using a single client 
interface – access interoperable tools to review, process and exploit multiple types of data 
or products from multiple sensors and databases.  Decision Fusion includes the use of 
information from multiple communities, e.g., multi-INT, in order to assess a situation, 
and to collaborate with a common operational picture.  A more detailed description of the 
decision fusion process, e.g., JDL and OODA models, is provided in Section 8.3.1.  This 
study also considered more recent advances such as social networking to support decision 
fusion.  Though the focus of the study is on military intelligence (“INT”), decision fusion 
is relevant to business intelligence, urban planning, and many other domains. 

Figure 3 shows an example of decision fusion that goes beyond current Web Mapping 
Tools to associate trends and causes from multiple sources. In an Afghanistan election 
attack scenario (Figure 3) a likely target for an attack against the Pashtun during the 2009 
election would be in Jalalabad, a largely Pashtun area with strong ties to Karzai, and a 
target of recent IED. The largest polling station in the area is at Compano Mosq, with an 
estimated 13,700 voters. An attack here on election day could impact the outcome.

8.2 Enterprise Objectives for Decision Fusion  

8.2.1 Decision Fusion Node 
To structure the context for decision fusion, this study defines an “operations node 
conducting decision fusion”.  External interfaces for a Decision Fusion Node are shown 
in Figure 4.  Descriptions of each arrow on the context diagram are provided in Table 2. 

The Decision Fusion Node defined in this study is a scalable concept ranging from a 
person with a mobile computer to a Fusion Center such as the centers identified in the US 
ODNI Analytic Transformation [ODNI, 2008] and the Information Sharing Environment 
(ISE) Fusion Centers as operated by the US Department of Homeland Security [DoJ 
Global, 2008]. 

The Decision Fusion Node described in this section is intended to apply to a wide variety 
of situations ranging from local to international operations; from civilian emergency 
response to military command and control.  Implicit in the concept of the Decision 
Fusion Node is the collaboration with other nodes, e.g., distributed decision fusion. 

Functions of a Decision Fusion Node are those steps necessary to perform a fusion 
process  [DoJ Global, 2008], [ODNI, 2008], [Randol, 2009]: 

1. Information collection and recognition of indicators and warnings 
2. Situation Assessment: Processing and collation of information  
3. Impact Assessment and Decision: Analysis and decision  
4. Information dissemination: to associated nodes and to public networks  
5. Process Refinement, including planning and requirements development

8.2.2 MASAS 

The Multi-Agency Situational Awareness System (MASAS) initiative is a collaborative 
effort of Canadian emergency management agencies and content providers, co-led by 
GeoConnections and the Centre for Security Science, to develop a national capability for 
the exchange of geospatial emergency incident information. Based on open and 
interoperable standards, the system will combine information from multiple sources to 
support decision-making through improved situational awareness for participating 
organizations. An opportunity exists to study the required standards, both existing and 
potential, for decision fusion processes within MASAS.  GeoConnections responded to 
the Fusion Study Phase 2 RFI with the MASAS architecture. 

The MASAS Architecture was developed in response to requirements from the public 
safety and security community. It has been used to design and deploy component 
MASAS systems for Multi-Agency incident information sharing. The opportunity exists 
to expand MASAS to a number of other decision fusion applications such as the fusion of 
science-based emergency response information and cross-border information fusion. 
Additionally, the MASAS initiative could benefit from many of the study areas identified 
in the RFI-2 for fusion standards.

8.2.3 Integrated Public Alerting and Warning System (IPAWS) 

IPAWS is designed to improve public safety through the rapid dissemination of 
emergency messages to as many people as possible over as many communications 
devices as possible.  The US Department of Homeland Security FEMA is upgrading the 
alert and warning infrastructure so that no matter what the crisis, the public will receive 
life-saving information. In IPAWS, several project initiatives are using EDXL messaging 
technologies to enhance and expand the alerting capabilities available to emergency

8.2.4 Enterprise Scenarios 

8.2.4.1 Scenario: Connecting the Dots  
This scenario considers connecting information held by several Decision Fusion Nodes in 
the determination of a plan of attack by an individual or small group. 

This scenario is motivated by the “Christmas Day Attack” of 2009 when a terrorist 
onboard a flight bound for Detroit attempted to ignite a bomb attached to his body.  
Lessons learned from the attack included [Travers, 2010]: 

• This incident does not raise major information sharing issues. The key derogatory 
information was widely shared across the U.S. Counterterrorism Community. The 
“dots” simply were not connected. 

• The U.S. Government needs to improve its overall ability to piece together partial, 
fragmentary information from multiple collectors. This requirement gets beyond 
watchlisting support, and is a very complicated challenge involving both numbers of 
analysts and the use of technology to correlate vast amounts of information housed in 
multiple agencies and systems.   

This scenario also considers the Nationwide SAR Initiative (NSI) that is designed to 
increase the amount of information—the intelligence “dots”—that will flow from state,

OGC 10-184

local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to the federal government. The goal of 
“connecting the dots” becomes more difficult when there is an increasingly large volume 
of “dots” to sift through and analyze.  [Randol, 2009] 

8.2.4.2 Scenario: Human presence detection through Multi-INT 
Prior to committing personnel to investigate a building or suspicious site such as a cave, 
it is imperative to determine the importance and current danger of the site.  This scenario 
aims to integrate information from multiple sources, i.e., multi-INT.  The scenario will 
involve fusing information from sensors with cultural and human information about the 
area, and recent intelligence reports from human observers.  [Thyagaraju Damarla, 2007],  
[ODNI, 2010] 

This scenario will consider observing and characterizing the “human landscape” or 
“human terrain.”  The scenario will also include quantification of the uncertainty and 
provenance in the decision fusion. 

8.2.4.3 Scenario: Disaster Management 
Actors for a Disaster Management scenario would be located at multiple command 
centers, each operating with different jurisdictions and perspectives. 

• National/Regional/Local Command Centers 
• Analytical Staff in support of Decision Maker 
• Analytical staff that make recommendations.  
• “on the scene” (in theatre) field personnel. 
• Consumers and Producers of information. 

A concrete example is EMS professional on site of a disaster, e.g., a major flood.  Flood 
is reported to local command center – need ingress/egress routes and support vehicles to 
respond. Analyst looks at this request and determines possible routes, available resources 
etc to respond.  Analyst makes recommendation to Decision Maker who dispatches 
resources to site.  Which resources to send and what routes taken?  Are the resources 
sufficient?  May have “patients” at site(s) – what medical care is needed? 
8.3 Information for Decision Fusion 

8.3.1 Fusion Process Models 

8.3.1.1 JDL Fusion Model  
The JDL Fusion Model has a rich history of discussion (see for example [Eloi Bosse, 
2007]).  A revision of the JDL Model by [Steinberg, Bowman, & White, 1999] depicts 
typical information flow across the data fusion “levels.”   JDL Level 0 and Level 1 
correspond to the Sensor Fusion and Object/Feature Fusion.  JDL Levels 2, 3, and 4 are 
relevant to Decision Fusion.   

• Situation Assessment (Level 2): Perception of environmental elements within a 
volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection 
of their status in the near future.  [Wikipedia, 2010] 

• Impact Assessment (Level 3): process for considering the implications, for 
people and their environment, of proposed actions while there is still an 



OGC 10-184 

20 Co

opportunity to modify (or, if appropriate, abandon) the proposals. It is applied at 
all levels of decision-making, from policies to specific projects. [IAIA, 2010] 

• Process Refinement (an element of Resource Management) (Level 4): adaptive 
data acquisition and processing to support mission objectives. [Steinberg, 
Bowman, & White, 1999] 

The terms Situation Awareness and Common Operating Picture (COP) are often 
conflated.  Situation awareness is the combined product of perception, comprehension, 
and projection.  COP is a combination of products of psyhcology, technology and 
integration processes.  The conclusion of [Eloi Bosse, 2007] is that COP provides only a 
partial full situation awareness. 

Processing of spatial, temporal, and semantic attributes of multi-source object metadata 
results in situation assessment.  On the basis of a situation assessment an analysis of 
threats can be conducted.  Solano and Tanik [Solano & Tanik, 2008] define an extension 
to the ISO 19115 metadata standard to capture the necessary metadata for a fusion 
framework which implements the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL)  Data-fusion 
model. 

 
Figure 7 – Refined JDL Data Fusion Model 

8.3.1.2 Decision Models 
Once Situation Assessment and Impact Assessment are accomplished, an operations node 
is well poised to consider decision and action.  Again there is a rich history of research on 
decision-making models (See for example [Das, 2008]). 

Decision fusion can be seen as the top of the information pyramid both in terms of 
information consumption and in terms of generating requests for new information.  As 
Galdos identified  [OGC, 2009], “Decision making is about making choices amongst 
alternatives (decision tree).  It should be noted, however, that the set of choices might be

OGC 10-184 

Co

quite dynamic and evolve in the course of an event (i.e. driven by the evolution of the 
event), or in an event independent manner. Decision makers want to learn from past 
mistakes (and are often also liable for their actions) hence the ability to automatically 
maintain an audit trail of decisions and their connection to particular feature and sensor 
information is critical.” 

The OODA loop (for observe, orient, decide, and act) is a concept originally applied to 
the combat operations process, often at the strategic level in both the military operations. 
It is now also often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes. 
The concept was developed by military strategist and USAF Colonel John Boyd. Any 
Internet search of Boyd and OODA will provide sources of all types on this topic.  Figure 
8 shows how current OGC standards support OODA.  Observe and Orient are well 
supported by the current OGC standards baseline.  Additional development and 
application of open standards is needed for Decide and Act, e.g., Decision Objects. 

 
Figure 8 – OGC standards support of OODA 

The OGC Fusion Study, Part 1 recommended that an information model be developed 
treating “Decision” as a first class object.  The model needs to be done at abstract and 
implementation levels.  The abstract model should define the attributes, operations and 
associations of a decision.  For example a decision object should include an aggregation 
with decision trees, policies and audit trail.  The decision object should include geospatial 
data and non-geospatial data.  This abstract decision object should then be tested with 
real decisions from routine operational settings.  Realizations of the decision should be 
made so that decision types can be used in registry and encodings defined for exchange. 
8.3.1.3 Multi-INT information 

Information available to an operations node is not just multi-source, but is from multiple 
intelligence collection types (multi-INT). Intelligence sources are people, documents, 

pyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 21
 



OGC 10-184 

22 Co

equipment, or technical sensors, and can be grouped according to intelligence disciplines 
(Table 3). 

Table 3 – Multi-INT Sources [Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2007] 

• Human intelligence (HUMINT);  
• Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), including Imagery 

Intelligence  
• Signals intelligence (SIGINT);  
• Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT);  
• Open-source intelligence (OSINT);  
• Technical intelligence (TECHINT);  
• Counterintelligence (CI).  

Open source intelligence (OSINT) is a form of intelligence collection management that 
involves finding, selecting, and acquiring information from publicly available sources 
and analyzing it to produce actionable intelligence. In the intelligence community (IC), 
the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or 
classified sources); it is not related to open-source software or public intelligence. 

Examples of multi-INT for an urban situation are shown in Figure 9. [Marco A. Pravia, 
2008].  Information elements are placed in the table according to generating source 
(header row) and classification between hard and soft information (below and above the 
diagonal, respectively).

Consideration of multi-INT in fusion is a basis for two major trends data fusion related to 
“soft” fusion.  [Hall, 2008] 

• First, the entities that we are interested in are no longer exclusively physical and 
may include events, patterns and activities. We are becoming interested in the 
location, identity, and interactions of individuals and groups (social networks). 

• The second major trend in information fusion is the emergence of two new 
categories of information that have previously been relatively neglected; human 
observations and web-based information. With the advent of ubiquitous cell 
phones, personal data devices (PDAs) and mobile computing devices (with 
associated GPS, image sensors and on-board computing), we can consider formal 
and informal “communities of observers” that provide information about an 
evolving situation.  (See Section 10.3.6)   

 

8.3.2 Structured Information  

8.3.2.1 Overview 

Having discussed several models for fusion, the information used in those models is now 
considered in two broad categories: structured information, and unstructured information. 
Here structured information is defined to conform to structures, e.g., standards, defined 
by a community of practice. The categories of this section are inspired by the intelligence 
communities listed in Table 3.  Some of the material in this section applies to Feature 
Fusion, but is described a single time here in the Decision Fusion section. 

An outcome of the Decision Fusion Workshop was that OGC should continue to apply 
those standards that have been previously developed to the Decision Fusion topics.  
Existing OGC standards for structured information include the OGC Abstract 
Specification with focus on the Topics of Features, Coverages, Observations, and 
Geometry. 

A conclusion of the Decision Fusion Workshop is that additional development is to be 
done on standards for structured information that support Decision Fusion both internal to 
OGC and with other standards bodies.  For example, further work is needed on methods 
for schema mapping, e.g., identification of rules for mappings, and an increase in the 
focus on handling of Associations as the identification of an association between entities 
is at the heart of fusion. 

8.3.2.2 Decision Information Standards 
Decision-making is a topic that reaches beyond geospatial information.  Decision fusion 
should be based on standards for decisions that have a general perspective.  More work is 
needed to identify standards in this area. 

8.3.2.3 Geographic and Imagery Information Standards 
Standards for geographic and imagery information directly relevant to decision include 
the following: 

• OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) Implementation Specification

information sharing between government entities and the full range of emergency-related 
organizations. EDXL standardizes messaging formats for communications between these 
parties. EDXL was developed as a royalty-free standard by the OASIS International 
Open Standards Consortium.  EDXL standards support operations, logistics, planning and 
finance:

specifications are submitted in partnership with the Emergency Interoperability 
Consortium (EIC). Draft specifications emerging from this process are forwarded to the 
OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee for consideration, vote and 
possible adoption as free, international, public XML-based messaging standards. 

8.3.2.6 Signals intelligence standards  
Standards for signals intelligence (SIGINT) directly relevant to decision include 
standards for alerts for tactically significant events and SIGINT identity information 

8.3.2.7 Measurement and signature intelligence standards  
Standards for measurement and signature intelligence information (MASINT) directly 
relevant to decision include standards for: alerts for tactically significant events and 
MASINT identity information 

8.3.2.8 Political geography 
The increasing interest in observing and characterizing the “human landscape” or “human 
terrain” using both conventional and emerging information sources motivated the 
assessment of technologies related to understanding and modeling the new domains.  
[InnoVision, 2009] 

Standards are needed for sharing of information in these key sub-areas: (1) human 
landscape modeling technologies, (2) identifying and representing data imperfections and 
lineage, (3) modeling object data acquisition and management, (4) addressing moving 
objects – map merging and tracking, (5) understanding what data needs to be observed or 
collected, and (6) mapping observables to parameter needs of selected models. 

8.3.3 Unstructured Information 

8.3.3.1 Overview 

In the world of information sharing there is much “unstructured data”.  Unstructured data 
is data for which there is no data model, or at least no data model that exposes any of the 
semantics of the data.  An HTML document, for example, might have a well-defined 
structure, but this is no help in understanding the document, since the markup is only 
intended for visualization and browser interaction control. Sometimes much can be 
inferred, but in essence the HTML model for the document is not very helpful for 
understanding the content.  The same can be said of other machine-readable but not 
machine understandable document formats such as PDF. Of course, what it means to 



OGC 10-184

understand a document may be very application related, so in some sense all data can be 
considered unstructured if used outside of its native application. 

Since a great deal of information falls into this unstructured category there is interest in 
attaching new information to add structure or meaning to the content.  Of course this is to 
be done where possible without changing the content itself.  (This topic was discussed in 
the Phase 2 Workshop and reported in Section 9.3.1) 

8.3.3.2 Open Source information 

OSINT is based on publicly available information as well as other unclassified 
information that has limited public distribution or access. Examples of OSINT include 
on-line official and draft documents, published and unpublished reference materiel, 
academic research, databases, commercial and noncommercial websites, “chat rooms,” 
and web logs (“blogs”).  

8.3.3.3 OpenSource.gov 

One source of consolidated OSINT is OpenSource.gov that provides timely and tailored 
translations, reporting and analysis on foreign policy and national security issues from the 
OpenSourceCenter and its partners. Featured are reports and translations from thousands 
of publications, television and radio stations, and Internet sources around the world. Also 
among the site's holdings are a foreign video archive and fee-based commercial databases 
for which OSC has negotiated licenses. OSC's reach extends from hard-to-find local 
publications and video to some of the most renowned thinkers on national security issues 
inside and outside the US Government. Accounts are available to US Government 
employees and contractors.   

8.3.3.4 Metadata Extraction and Tagging Service (METS) 

The Metadata Extraction and Tagging Service (METS) is a Department of Defense 
Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) Core Service that extracts information found 
within unstructured documents. This promotes integration with structured data and will 
significantly improve search, analysis, and knowledge discovery. METS automates the 
normalization of, and extraction of information from, text documents, making the content 
of the documents quickly available as XML and OWL (Web Ontology Language) / RDF 
(Resource Description Framework) for intelligence analysis. 

GML in METS is a conversion of a very small piece of the GML XML spec. It lumps 
together some small ontologies recommended by the W3C. It was supplemented by a few 
additional GML concepts used by DoD Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS). 

8.3.4 Information Integration 

8.3.4.1 Linking 

In order to connect the dots, information elements must be linked which many times 
depends upon the information being tagged with attributes describing its semantics. OGC 
discussions have focused on the need to increase the use of linking standards such as 
xlink and 'URIReference'.  [Cox, 2010] 



OGC 10-184 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 27
 

OGC has developed draft proposed standards for linking unstructured information with 
geographic tags: 

• Geolinked Data Access Service 
• Georeferenced Table Joining Service (TJS) Implementation Standard 

8.3.4.2 Tagging 

Tagging of data from structured and unstructured sources is valuable towards integration 
of  

• UCore 
• Department of Defense Discovery Metadata  (DDMS) 
• Dublin Core 

Tagging is done differently for hard versus soft sources.  In hard fusion from a known 
sensor, tagging is often object attribution and feature characterization.  While soft fusion 
must deal with increased uncertainty and provide basic context, e.g., location for hand-
held photos, semantic labels for correlation, etc. 

Geo-tagging is the process of attaching a location to an information element.  There are 
multiple information structures for geo-tagging.  Many of the geo-tags have been 
developed within specific communities. 

• Standards developments for geo-tags 
o OGC OpenLS Point of Interest 
o IETF PIDF-LO 
o URISA/FGDC US Street Address Data Standard  
o ISO 19160, Addressing 
o W3C Point of Interest Working group (proposed)  

• Formats 
o http://microformats.org/wiki/implementations 
o Open formats: KML, GPS (waypoints), GeoRSS/GeoJSON 
o Vendor formats: NAVTEQ, TomTom, TIGER 
o Nokia Landmarks Exchange Format (2005) 
o Yahoo: Where On Earth ID (WOEID). 

8.3.4.3 Ontology Alignment 

Current conceptual models for information fusion, including the JDL model do not 
consider the fact that their information sources are often based on different ontological 
bases.  [Dorion, 2007] therefore suggests that the JDL model, which caters for space and 
time common referencing, be augmented with the notional aspect of common ontological 
alignment.   Ontology alignment is the act of establishing a relation of correspondence 
between two or more symbols from distinct ontologies, for those symbols that denote 
concepts that are semantically identical, or similar. 

Standards directly relevant to decision fusion for ontologies include: 
• OWL 
• RDF 
• Advanced Authoring Format (AAF) 

http://microformats.org/wiki/implementations


OGC 10-184 

28 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

 
Understanding a timeline events can be critical to Situation Awareness.  Advanced 
Authoring Format (AAF) can be used to place various information elements into a 
timeline.  AAF was developed for the interchange of audio-visual material and associated 
metadata.  While the original purpose of AAF is for video postproduction and authoring 
environment, AAF has been applied to fusion of multiple information sources regarding 
an actual timeline. [AMWA, 2010] 

8.3.4.4 Uncertainty  

Uncertainty propagation was a theme across all of the fusion categories discussed in the 
Phase 1 of Fusion Standards Study.  Methods for propagating uncertainty into a decision 
framework are needed.   Methods for presenting uncertain information in human-machine 
interface are needed.  Communicating uncertain information to users is a non-trivial task 
and must build upon the results of on-going research.  Development of this topic should 
begin with a “hard fusion” topic, i.e., a topic for which the uncertainty can be calculated 
from input uncertainty values.  

• Uncertainty Markup Language (UnCertML) – OGC Discussion Paper 
 
8.4 Services for Decision Fusion 

8.4.1 Service-Oriented Architecture 
The most effective environment for accomplishing the various types of fusion is expected 
to be a network-centric architecture with distributed databases and services based on a 
common core of standards-based data formats, algorithms, services, and applications. 
Such an environment allows the various forms of information to be collected, stored, 
managed, fused and disseminated vertically (from international to individual level) and 
horizontally (peer to peer). 

A fusion environment involves people, processes, data, and technology that combine 
functional information with information about space and time (Figure 10).  This means 
combining information from ISR, C2, planning assets, and multi-INT in space and time 
in order to assemble, relate, and coordinate relevant information from a variety of 
disparate sources and to provide a common situational understanding and a cohesive set 
of decision solutions.  

In the conceptual fusion environment depicted in Figure 10, there are aggregator, 
processor and viewer services supporting collecting and consolidating, generating and 
synthesizing, and viewing and filtering activities, respectively. Information flows in 
various raw, processed, and fused representations into the fusion environment via 
network linkages enabled by connections between external source nodes and 
interoperability nodes.  Interoperability Nodes and External Source Nodes may support a 
variety of service and encoding standards, supporting both producer and consumer 
interconnections.

Figure 10 – Fusion Services Environment 

8.4.2 Service Platforms 
Services may be deployed using multiple technologies, e.g., REST, SOAP, and JAVA.  
The OGC recommends development of service oriented architecture standards using 
platform-independent abstract specifications and platform-dependent implementation 
specifications for all OGC service standards that support both procedure-oriented and 
resource-oriented service styles or patterns.  

8.4.3 Services 

8.4.3.1 Overview 

The section identifies standards relevant to the services and components identified in the 
service-oriented architecture of the previous section.  Services for data fusion were a 
topic during the Phase 2 Workshop with one result being Figure 10.  On the right-side fo 
the figure are listed the types of services in which OGC has established a mature baseline 
of open standards. The left side of the figure considers services that are beyond the scope 
of just OGC.  A key part of Decision Fusion is the ability to bring these two sides 
together.  For example most data has a location component but many times this location 
information is implicit.  In order to make associations based on location, the non-geo data 
needs to be geotagged and associated with the rich stores of geographic information 
resulting in a new level of understanding based on the new associations.

8.4.3.2 Messaging: Alerts and Events 
Much exchange of messages in a fusion environment is done using e-mail.  These 
messages relate to specific events and are also used for planning and requirements 

Alerts are structured information intended for immediate human attention. Alerts maybe 
passed by e-mail and more specialized services defined for SOAP and REST 
environments. 

Events are structured information but not necessarily intended for immediate human 
attention. Events maybe passed by e-mail and more specialized services defined for 
SOAP and REST environments.  OGC has defined events services for sensor related 
services. [Everding, 2009] 

In addition to direct exchange of messages from producer to consumer, the 
publish/subscribe pattern allows for looser coupling of the source and receiver of 
messages. 

In the SOAP oriented, “WS-*” world, publish / subscribe can be handled with WS-
Notification [OASIS, 2006]. WS-Notification makes use of notification topics, which 
support a mix of the subscription models channels and types.  

Instant messaging approaches may be considered for message passing.  XMPP is a 
standard for XML message streaming.  Various commercial vendor solutions for instant 
messaging also exist. 

Methods based on open standards are needed to quickly communicate situation 
conditions and response of decisions makers to a large number of people in a specific 
geographic region.  These announcements need to be coordinated though standards from 
a variety of communities, e.g., emergency response community using CAP and EXDL-
DE.  Methods involving dynamic high-speed routing of alerts to geographic regions are 
needed.  This notification needs to include the available data (maps, digital data, imagery) 
based on geographic area of interest

8.4.3.3 Search including filters 
Search has many variations: searching of a catalogue, federated search across multiple 
catalogues, real-time filtering of feeds. 

The OGC Catalog Service Specification is an interface standard that can be used on any 
catalogue and includes geospatial extensions.  The OGC Catalogue service can be applied 
to centralized or federated search architectures. 

Harvesting of distributed information in advance allows for a user query to be evaluated 
against a single catalogue.  As examples, two centralized catalogues are: 

• The Catalyst program uses metadata to correlate information from diverse 
intelligence sources (multi-INT), without attempting to fuse all of the original 
intelligence directly.  Catalyst will operate upon tagged entities such as person 
names and place names and expose this metadata to algorithms.  [ODNI, 2008] 

• Google crawls the Web to collect the contents of every accessible site. This data 
is broken down into an index (organized by word, just like the index of a 
textbook), a way of finding any page based on its content. Every time a user types 
a query, the index is combed for relevant pages, returning a list that commonly 
numbers in the hundreds of thousands, or millions. The trickiest part, though, is 
the ranking process — determining which of those pages belong at the top of the 
list. [Levy, 2010] 

Federated search is the process of performing a simultaneous real-time search of multiple 
diverse and distributed sources from a single search page, with the federated search 
engine acting as intermediary.  Important Features of Federated Search: aggregation, 
ranking, and de-duplication (or “dedup’ing”).   

As resources become more dynamic new methods for search are needed.  This is in 
particular true for web resources such as news feeds, blogs, and social media.   Typical 
catalogues first aggregate content via time-consuming harvesting.  These factors have 
increased the demand for an opportunity for real-time search using filters. [Geer, 2010] 

Search functionality is desirable and, in fact, available also on further geographic data 
types: Filter Encoding allows predicate based search on features, the Web Coverage 
Processing Service (WCPS) allows the same on multi-dimensional raster coverages. 

8.4.3.4 Data access: structured and unstructured 
Access services to unstructured, open-source data focus on the WWW – http and 
associated protocols. 

Structured data access services may include additional semantics related to the data 
structure.  For example access to geospatial data can be accomplished with these open 
standards:  

• OGC Web Map Service 
• OGC Web Feature Service 
• OGC Web Coverage Service 



OGC 10-184

8.4.3.5 Social Networking 
Data Fusion needs access to tools such as Social Networking Services (SNS), social 
media, user- generated content, social software, e-mail, instant messaging, and discussion 
forums (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Google Apps).   

Social networking can be used on trusted networks perhaps within a decision node or set 
of coordinate nodes, e.g., A-space.  Social networking using public is relevant to the 
mission of decision fusion, where the sources may not be trusted. 

Social networking is becoming recognized as integral to operations in many domains, 
e.g., US Department of Defense  [DoD, 2010].   

Examples of Social networking relevant to Decision Fusion, several need to be enhanced 
with geospatial capabilities: 

• A-Space is a common collaborative workspace for US intelligence community 
analysts. A-Space, will give analysts shared access to corporate data and to 
numerous databases maintained by individual IC organizations.  [ODNI, 2008] 

• Intellipedia is the US Intelligence Community’s (IC) version of the world’s user-
annotated online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. Intellipedia enables collaborative 
drafting of short articles, which can be combined to form lengthy documents, all 
using a simple interface in a web browser. [ODNI, 2008] 

• GeoChat aims to integrate mobile field communications with situational 
awareness.  GeoChat - a google.org supported project for responding to disease 
spread and disasters GeoChat emerged from a simple concept - can I send an SMS 
message and see it on a map?  InSTEDD GeoChat is a unified mobile 
communications service.  [InSTEDD, 2010] 

Of particular importance for social networking is the need to identify methods for 
capturing and retaining provenance of the source. 

8.4.3.6 Visualization and Portrayal 
A key aspect for establishing context is the visualization of an environment. Visualization 
for decision fusion in a network environment can be accomplished in two, three, or more 
dimensions, for example including temporal or parametric content, or links to relational 
data tables.  From a distributed information system point of view, the visualization can 
occur within a component located on the clients computer (“smart” or integrated client) 
or the visualization can be accomplished remotely and simply displayed on a client’s 
computer (“thin” client).  See Section 8.4.4.2 for discussion of Integrated Clients.  This 
clients rely on standards that provide for remote visualization: 

• The OGC Web Map Service (WMS) standard allows fusion of two-dimensional 
images to be fused based upon common coordinate reference system. 

• The OGC Web 3-D Services (W3DS) discussion paper allows fusion of three-
dimensional models to be fused based upon common coordinate reference system:  
scene composition. 

Visualization must include the ability to change the Symbology for features displayed. 
Symbology styles may be used to provide still more hints to an analyst or other user. Data 
and map product specifications generally determine the precise symbology to be used in a 



OGC 10-184 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 33
 

given context. But additional conventions may be suggested and prototyped for 
distinguishing selected features and/or feature properties from their neighbors and 
surrounding background. As information sources become ever more cluttered with detail, 
it becomes increasingly important to find ways to focus attention where it is most needed. 

The OGC SLD Profile for WMS standard defines an encoding that extends the WMS 
standard to allow user-defined symbolization and coloring of geographic feature and 
coverage data. SLD addresses the need for users and software to be able to control the 
visual portrayal of the geospatial data. The ability to define styling rules requires a styling 
language that the client and server can both understand. The OGC Symbology Encoding 
Standard (SE) provides this language. 

Of particular interest for urban situations is viewing the built environment.  The 
surveying and photogrammetry community are developing broad-scale, wholesale three-
dimensional models of cities; architects and engineers are developing very detailed 
infrastructure models, and ordinary citizens are using free tools to create and share 
models of their neighborhoods. There are many types of documents or data objects that 
might be referenced to the built infrastructure and natural environments.  The documents 
and data may be items such as evacuation plans, road conditions, inventories of 
hazardous materials, current environment indicators and weather conditions that would 
be useful to be able to discover and access based on references to locations.   

8.4.3.7 Collaboration  
Decision Fusion includes collaboration of various persons in developing an 
understanding of a specific context.  Collaboration with other decision makers and 
analysts can be accomplished using social networking services and collaboration tools 
that are location enabled.   

One enabling element of collaboration is encoding methods for capturing and sharing the 
context or picture created by one analyst to be shared with others.  Several of these 
encoding methods are described in the following. 

• OWS Context standard 
• KML standard 

For decision making in a collaborative environment, communications mechanisms and 
services are needed.  As demonstrated in OWS-3, a video feed from a UAV over a fire 
location is broadcast to several locations [OGC, 2005].  The several locations are 
connected so that they can see the same video, with the ability for each location to 
highlight a location on the video for the other locations to see.  While sharing and co-
interacting this common picture the locations are able to talk and chat.  The result being 
artifacts to be saved and made part of the decision object.  This coordination can be 
achieved with OWS Context, KML, LoF, and other mechanisms.  This would require that 
OWS Context be extended to support imagery, video, audio, digital data, map represented 
data – for multi-int fusion. 

8.4.3.8 Sensor webs 
Decision nodes need access to sensor fusion results and the ability to request additional 
sensor information.  Access to sensors using standards is accomplished with the OGC 
Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards: 



OGC 10-184 

34 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

• Sensor Observation Service 
• Sensor Planning Service 
• Sensor Alert Service 

8.4.3.9 Processing and Analysis  
In order to support decision fusion, in some cases processing of the source data is 
required.  

Use of the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) with profiles enables a standards based 
approach to many types of analysis. One such processing profile, which is under 
development, is the Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) defining a declarative 
language for multi-dimensional raster processing. 

Processing to provide thematic, statistical, exploratory, spatial/topological and other 
forms of analysis with open access (public, non-standard) and multi-media data of a 
socio-cultural nature is a topic in the OWS-7 Testbed using WPS.  This is of primary 
importance to anticipate, prepare for, and mitigate situations requiring urgent and 
emergency response.   In OWS-7 Testbed this type of analysis is referred to simply as 
Feature and Statistical Analysis (FSA), which we define as a multidisciplinary scientific 
approach to describe and predict spatial and temporal patterns of human behavior by 
analyzing the attributes, actions, reactions and interactions of groups or individuals in 
the context of their environment. FSA incorporates elements of Human Geography in a 
spatial, temporal context.  FSA includes aspects of Socio-Cultural Dynamics (SCD), 
which is defined as information about the social, cultural and behavioral factors 
characterizing the relationships and activities of the population of a specific region. FSA 
also includes geospatial vector and topology processing operations.    

8.4.3.10 Workflow 
In enterprise environments, it becomes necessary to produce complex functional 
capabilities that are composed from a variety of existing services using workflow 
orchestration and choreography using such standards as BPEL.  To meet the needs within 
and across enterprises that may be using different process engines and languages a more 
abstract approach is needed to facilitate design, integration, execution and management 
of these processes many of which will be asynchronous by nature.  

Geoprocessing Workflow is an automation of a spatial process/model, in whole or part, 
during which information is passed from one distributed geoprocessing service to another 
according to a set of procedural rules using standardized interfaces.  [Schäffer, 2009] 

To cope with the crush of huge and growing data volumes to be processed, it is important 
to augment human awareness and expert knowledge with service-supported workflow 
processes as much as possible. This could be in the form of enhanced context awareness 
governing choices available and properties of each choice in a workflow. A key objective 
is to improve the quality of any given workflow, while lowering its cost, and improving 
performance.  Tradeoffs of regarding roles of human in the loop vs. full automation of 
workflow should be investigated.  



OGC 10-184

8.4.3.11 Security 
The architecture must apply standards-based security solutions for deploying services in 
the fusion domain. This brings in the requirement for handling services that sensors and 
other data sources that produce classified information and the main objective of 
accreditation.  

Requirements for secure services are based on the Trusted Computer System Evaluation 
Criteria (TCSEC), A Security Architecture for Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), 
the Internet Threat Model, as defined in IETF RFC 3552, and ISO 10181, “Security 
Frameworks for Open System.” 
RFI responses should respond with requirements and solutions for approaches to 
security, e.g., authentication and authorization, based on existing products.  RFI is 
seeking to identify major drivers related to fusion anticipating that much of the existing 
certification applies directly to the deployed solutions. 

8.4.4 Fusion Client Components 

8.4.4.1 Decision analysts toolbox 
In order to access the services and to exchange information, a Decision analyst needs to 
be provisioned with a set of tools including desktop clients and access to 
distributed/cloud services. 

The Global Justice program identifies a set of tools as the basic toolbox that an 
intelligence analyst will need.  In addition to the basic office applications on a personal 
computer, the toolbox should allow access to this information locally or remotely  
[Global Justice, 2006]: 

• Mapping/Geographic Information System (GIS) 
• Public Information Database Resources 
• Statistical Analysis Software 
• Timeline/Flowcharting 
• Link Analysis 
• Investigative Case Management 
• Communications/Telephone (Toll) Record Software 

 
An option presented to NGA based on a previous study was an “Analyst Fly-away kit” as 
a pre-configured analyst environment containing information (e.g. open source 
information, RSS feeds, etc.) that would support the analysis process.  This would enable 
experienced analysts to develop “lessons learned” from deployments (i.e., “ if only I had 
known this information, or included this tool...”) to help other analysts.  [InnoVision, 
2009] 

8.4.4.2 Integrated client 
Decision fusion client components access remote data from one or more Web services 
and provide manipulation of the data in the client application.  Decision support 
functionality may include filtering, aggregation, analysis, visualization, presentation, and 
interpretation of multiple sources of data.  Decision clients may provide a “dashboard” 
style user interface.  Decision support clients may be specific to a user community or may 
be more generic geospatial data applications.   



OGC 10-184 

36 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

Client applications which can be distributed free of charge are desired, note that this does 
not necessarily require that the code be open source. While this type of application is 
generally understood to be a user-facing component, this does not restrict the computing 
platform by which it is implemented.  

The OWS Testbeds have developed the concept and requirements for an OWS Integrated 
Client.  See for example OWS Integrated Client Discussion Paper (OGC 05-116) from 
OWS-5.  The Integrated Client concept was advanced further in OWS-6 and OWS-7. 

8.4.4.3 Fusion Portal 
A Web portal is a single point of access to information, which is linked from various 
logically related Internet based applications and is of interest to various types of users.  
Development of reusable portlets increases reuse between portals. 

Portals present information from diverse sources in a unified way; they provide a 
consistent look and feel with access control and procedures for multiple applications, 
which otherwise would have been different entities altogether. Generally, a portal 
provides: 

• Intelligent integration and access to enterprise content, applications and processes  

• Improved communication and collaboration among customers, partners, and 
employees  

• Unified, real-time access to information held in disparate systems 

• Personalized user interactions 

• Rapid, easy modification and maintenance of the website presentation  

8.4.4.4 Geospatial Decision Fusion Engine 

In an operational setting, the decision fusion services are used by analysts to compile 
related sets of spatial-temporal information from multi-source information for a specific 
context.  There is a need for increasingly capable client applications or “fusion engines” 
that can support decision fusion as shown in Figure 12.  A Decision Fusion Engine is 
conceived as a component that has access to streams of information relevant to an 
operational decision setting.  The fusion platform would create visualizations, and 
support analysis of aggregated data.  Temporal analysis should also be supported by 
animation and filtering.  Any of these analyses or visualization can be shared as 
embeddable objects into a variety of Web based collaboration software (wiki’s, blogs, 
web pages etc.). 

As an example, the FortiusOne GeoIQ platform allows results of any analysis or data 
aggregation to be visualized including dynamic aggregation and disaggregation of data.  
Data can be also visualized through its temporal dimensions by animation and filtering.  
Any of these analyses or visualization can be shared as embeddable objects into a variety 
of Web based collaboration software (wiki’s, blogs, web pages etc.).”  [FortiusOne, 
2009]

8.4.4.5 Information sharing between clients 

The OWS-7 Testbed investigated information sharing client applications including use of 
OWS Context document. Analysis and testing conducted in the Feature and Decision 
Fusion (FDF) thread of OWS-7 evaluated various methods of sharing information within 
a collaborative environment.  The intent of the OWS-7 Information Sharing activity was 
to move toward a standardized method of sharing geospatial data between Integrated 
Clients and potentially catalogs.   

Experimentation on an Atom-based approach for OWS Context was conducted in OWS-
7.  Based on those experiments the participants identified topics of further study to 
improve the viability of a future OWS Context specification.  The detailed topics are 
documented in the OWS-7 Information Sharing, including OWS Context Engineering 
Report  (OGC 10-035r1).  This topic is also relevant to the discussion about unstructured 
data (See Section 8.3.3) 

8.4.5 Registries for Fusion 

Registries are needed for all categories of Fusion.  Figure 13 shows the use of registries 
for the three categories of fusion.  Several standards for interfaces and data models for 
registries exist. 

In particular it would be useful to develop an ebRIM (V3.0) model for Decision fusion.  
This would use ebRIM Associations, Packages and ClassificationScheme registry objects 
to model feature associations for feature fusion.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM is selected since it 
is the basis of the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several OGC members have 
developed commercial implementations.

For Object/Feature Fusion, registries can be used to support use of unstructured 
information. The unstructured item is placed in the repository and the added information 
is held in the registry along with a link to the original data.  The OGC CSW ebRIM 
standard can be used in this later case

8.5 Recommendations 

8.5.1 Develop Decisions as First Class Objects in an Information Model 

Decisions should be modeled as first class object in an information model.  Such an 
information model would allow development of software for better sharing and 
processing of decisions in a distributed services environment.  A UML model showing a 
Decision Object would show attributed, relations and subclasses that describe the 
information associated with an object: attributes of the situation, e.g., location, 
alternatives courses of action, decision selection scheme, e.g., decision trees.   Defining a 
decision as an object allows for association between decisions. Decisions would link to 
structured and unstructured data with some unstructured data useful directly in the 
decision.  The model should support linking to events that trigger consideration of a 
decision and support traceability of post-decision. The UML model should be built with 
and in the context of existing UML information models.

8.5.2 Develop a design pattern relating events and decisions 

Develop a design pattern that triggers consideration of decision alternatives upon 
occurrence of an event:  “if you see this event, then consider these decisions”. When a 
registered event occurs a set of possible decision templates would be presented to a 
person.  Decisions would be based on Complex Events.  Show use of the event/decision 
pattern with several use cases.  Connect the pattern to the OGC Event Architecture and 
consider other eventing models.  Link the pattern to the Decision Object modeling in the 
previous recommendation. 

Continued harmonization of location in Emergency Management Standards in particular 
OASIS standards EDXL and GML is recommended.  EDXL provides a rich set of 
standards for Emergency Management decision-making.  These standards include 
information about location.  Carl Reed of OGC has been working with the OASIS 
Emergency Management Technical Committee towards harmonization of the OASIS and 
OGC standards.  Of particular importance is the continued work on the OASIS GML 
profile or “EDXL Where”.  Also relevant is coordination on NIEM and UCORE. 

8.5.3 Standardize methods for Information Sharing between clients. 

Conduct further experimentation and development on Information Sharing between 
fusion client components.  This work can build on the recommendations regarding OWS 
Context contained in OWS-7 Information Sharing, including OWS Context Engineering 
Report  (OGC 10-035r1).  The activity should result in a standardized method of sharing 
data, including geospatial, between Integrated Clients and potentially catalogs.   

8.5.4 Promote diversity of interoperable Fusion Analyst Components 

The standards developed for fusion should focus on interoperability.  It is desirable to 
minimize the number of interoperability standards in order to optimize and stabilize the 
communications.  In contrast, for components it is desirable to have a diversity of 
components that implement the standards.  This diversity of clients allows for meeting 
the various needs of different analysts and communities.  Components for the fusion 
analyst are the focus on the results of all three categories of fusion.  The analyst clients 
must be able to accept results from components performing observation, feature and 
decision fusion using interoperability standards.  The Analyst component may 
additionally perform fusion internal to the component.  (See Section 8.4.4) 

8.5.5 Develop registry for Decision Fusion, e.g., using ebRIM. 

Develop registries to support Decision Fusion, for example using an ebRIM (V3.0) 
model.  This would use ebRIM ClassificationScheme registry object to model a decision 
process as in a decision tree.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM is selected since it is the basis of the 
OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several OGC members have developed 
commercial implementations. 

8.5.6 Develop open standards for visualization relevant to fusion 

OGC has developed an initial baseline of standards to support geographic visualization in 
a distributed, interoperable environment.  These standards should continued to be 
matured for example in the areas of:  3D, uncertainty, provenance, and decision 
alternatives and selection.  



OGC 10-184

8.5.7  “See and Talk” collaboration with common geographic view 

For decision making in a collaborative environment, communications mechanisms and 
services are needed.  As demonstrated in OWS-3, a video feed from a UAV over a fire 
location is broadcast to several locations.  The several locations are connected so that 
they can see the same video, with the ability for each location to highlight a location on 
the video for the other locations to see.  While sharing and co-interacting this common 
picture the locations are able to talk and chat.  The result being artifacts to be saved and 
made part of the decision object.  This coordination can be achieved with OWS Context, 
KML, LoF, and other mechanisms.  This would require that OWS Context be extended to 
support imagery, video, audio, digital data, map represented data – for multi-int fusion.  

8.5.8 Coordination through social networks 

To be effective decision fusion must go beyond a strictly geospatial context.   This 
broadening must bring other data types as well as interaction with broader standards 
communities.  Social networks to collaborate, develop common understanding and make 
decisions should become part of our understanding of decision fusion.  Social networks 
can be used by the analyst to add structure to unstructured information.  Use of 
technologies like wikis and blogs that are spatially enabled and support the decision 
object approaches defined above, would provide a basis for collaborative decision 
making. 

8.5.9 Conduct a Decision Fusion initiative: Decision Fusion Pilot 

Conduct an initiative involving several Operational Nodes that perform decision fusion.  
To maximize the variability in the initiative, involve Nodes from different management 
federations, different domain responsibilities, different architectures and different 
countries – but using common interface standards.  Such diversity will aid in developing 
international standards that support interoperability across multiple functional domains.  
For example in the civilian domain, interoperability testing based on open standards for 
an event that involves MASAS and IPAWS would meet this recommendation (See 
Section 8.2).

9 Object/Feature Fusion  
9.1 Introduction 
The Fusion Standards Study ER, Phase 1, made recommendations regarding 
Object/Feature Fusion.  The supporting discussion for those recommendations is not 
repeated here.  Several of the Phase 1 recommendations were implemented in the OWS-7 
Testbed.  Many of the standards described in the Decision Fusion section of this ER 
apply also here to Feature/Object Fusion. 

Object/Feature Fusion is the processing of multiple sources of observations and features 
into higher order semantic features using techniques for identifying, aggregating, relating, 
parsing, and organizing and includes feature processing such as generalization, 
conflation, feature extraction, and change detection.  Object/Feature fusion yields 
information resources that are more powerful, flexible, and accurate than any of the 
original sources.  A workflow of Feature Fusion is presented in Figure 14. 

 
Figure 14 - OWS-5 Feature Fusion workflow example 

Conflation technology offers useful options to deal with imperfect, heterogeneous, 
conflicting, and duplicated data. It is possible to use conflation to correlate disparate data 
sources, but not necessarily with a goal of merging them. Conflation has algorithms to 
compare, match, or link multiple representations of features using measures of similarity 
in semantics, geometry, and topology. Understanding how two data representations 
correlate or differ helps to reinforce, refute, or augment knowledge of an area, and are 
key to conflation’s role in data fusion.  [NTA, 2009]  

Conflation for selecting the “best” of all sources is not a one-size-fits-all problem, subject 
to the actual feature data being processed, user knowledge and expertise, and other 
criterion. As such, a comprehensive set of business rules is necessary to control aspects of 

pyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 41
 



OGC 10-184 

42 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

the process such as feature prioritization, attribute handling, coding standard conversions, 
and more, and be applicable to the core conflation processing as well as pre- conflation 
data setup and preparation steps.   

A service-oriented architecture is well suited to support distributed conflation rules 
services. A rule “provider” could define custom rules and make those rules available to 
conflation services and applications. We envision two use cases for handling conflation 
rules services, 1) where the client only supports predefined sets of rules and 2) where the 
client allows user customization of the conflation rules. (OGC 07-160r1) 
9.2 OWS-7 FDF Implementations 

9.2.1 OWS-7 FDF Overview 

Recommendations from the Fusion Study Phase 1 were implemented in the Feature and 
Decision Fusion (FDF) thread of the OWS-7 Testbed.  OWS-7 FDF built on the OWS-6 
Geoprocessing Workflow and Decision Support Services work, to advance common 
interfaces for information cataloguing and sharing, feature and statistical analysis, 
synchronization of multiple geospatial databases, Web Processing Services (WPS) 
profiles, and the Integrated Client.   Task areas for FDF in OWS-7 were: 

o Schema Automation: Transformation of NGA Application Schema (NAS) from 
UML to profiles of GML and KML. 

o Data Discovery, Organization and Sharing: Use of thematic categories in multi-
source data discovery, including augmented metadata for quality of source, and 
fitness for use. Organize in OWS Context documents—the analyst’s information 
resource “shoebox”. 

o Feature and Statistical Analysis (FSA): WPS profiles for feature fusion, including 
statistical analysis, vector and topological processing. 

o Geosynchronization: Components to support synchronization of geospatial data 
and updates across a formal or ad hoc Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI).   

o Alerting: Fuse alerts with geospatial analysis using OASIS Common Alerting 
Protocol (CAP) format. 

o Integrated Client: A field-ready client application to support and display sensor 
information, cataloguing metadata, notification alerts, statistical analyses, and 
save it all in a Context document.

9.2.2 WPS for Fusion 

Based on the results documented in Feature and Statistical Analysis ER  (OGC 10-074) 
and WPS Profiling ER (OGC 10-059), these recommendations relevant to Fusion 
Standards Study are noted: 

• WPS profiles are needed in order to achieve semantic interoperability of 
Geoprocessing.  Grouping of algorithms is needed.  The FAS ER identified 
hierarchies and classifications such as “Topology Analysis” and “Statistical 
Analysis”.  

• Designing WPS Profiles is a challenge not only regarding choosing the 
appropriate input and output type definitions, but also regarding choosing 
appropriate classifications. For this reason, a holistic approach is required to 
reflect the complexity of appropriate process design. 

• Metadata profiles for registering WPS in OGC Catalogs are missing and hinder 
the use of the publish-find-bind pattern. 

Future work should consider the prior development of WPS Profiles in OWS-5 regarding 
Conflation Rules.  Further consideration of the rules approaches identified in OWS-5 
should be considered.  OGC Document 07-160r1 from OWS-5 made this statement:   

• One possible approach to implementing rules as services would be to use the 
OGC WPS standard with the various conflation rules processes defined, for 
example, as GetRuleX, SetRuleY, etc. The DescribeProcess would describe the

inputs needed to retrieve the Rule as well as a description of the rule and its 
assumptions. 

9.2.3 Authoritative Data Source Directory 

A key part of supporting feature and decision fusion are catalog, or registry services, 
providing sophisticated capabilities to discover, organize and access relevant data 
sources. One currently popular term for this kind of information service is an 
Authoritative Data Source. 

An Authoritative Data Source Directory (ADSD) was investigated in the OWS-7 FDF 
Thread (OGC 10-086).  ADSD is a resource capable of organizing and discovering a 
wide variety of types of data such as web sites, books, pictures/images, et al. as well as 
available web services. The directory is to have the ability to identify and query for data 
sources based on socio-cultural themes, geographic area (either coordinates or geographic 
name), temporal relevance, and data quality (e.g. precision, fitness for use). The ADSD 
concept was implemented as an OGC Catalog Service supporting all interfaces of CSW 
2.0.2 plus extensions developed to support ADSD.  OpenSearch was adopted as a 
metaphor for the extensions. 
9.3 Phase 2 Study results on Object/Feature 

9.3.1 Structuring Unstructured Information 

9.3.1.1 Workshop discussion 

Unstructured information was a topic of discussion in the Fusion Standards Study 
Workshop.  Data having “no structure” was challenged with discussion leading to use of 
the definition from Wikipedia contained in RFI-2: “Unstructured data is data for which 
there is no data model, or at least no data model that exposes any of the semantics of the 
data” (See Section 8.3.3).  Several topics were identified in the workshop: 

• One challenge is for an information system to offer services on data for which it 
does not have an information model.  

• Recent web based collaborative and mashup techniques support moving less-
structured information to more-structured information through human-based 
interactions. 

• Techniques based on open standards are needed for gathering unstructured, public 
information 

• Methods for adding context and meaning to information in structured fashion are 
needed based on open standards for information models. 

In structuring information about an unstructured information item, one creates a model of 
the information item – meaning we select tags that help convey the meaning of 
information item.  These can be completely arbitrary, and the “model” (or list of tags) can 
be changed on the fly at any time.  The attached information items (tags) can have more 
or less arbitrary types – so can include simple types (integers, strings etc) but also 
geospatial or temporal tags.  We can use the tags to enable searching and retrieve it.  The 
search requests can make use any of the attached tags, including geospatial and temporal 
constraints, and can even look inside the unstructured items (e.g. look at the internals of 
an HTML document) where that might help in the discovery/access process. 



OGC 10-184 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 45
 

9.3.1.2 Registries for structuring information 

Management of the unstructured information and the newly associated information can 
be done using several alternative methods.  The new information can be directly added to 
the unstructured item or a registry/repository approach can be used.  In the latter case, the 
unstructured item is placed in the repository and the added information is held in the 
registry along with a link to the original data.  The OGC CSW ebRIM standard can be 
used in this later case (see Section 8.4.5).  The advantages and disadvantages of each 
approach can be obvious.  In the embedded case, the clear advantage is that all of the 
information is in one information package. In the exterior description approach the clear 
advantage is that can support multiple descriptions (perhaps for different applications) 
and not clutter a given package with extraneous information. 

CSW-ebRIM can be used for the management of unstructured data.  CSW-ebRIM is a 
standard from the OGC that builds on OASIS called ebRIM (eBusiness Registry 
Information Model).  CSW-ebRIM makes use of something called Reg-Rep, with 
Registry objects referencing and pointing to associated Repository items.  Think of the 
repository items as the unstructured information items, and the related registry objects as 
descriptions that expose their semantics.  Each repository item (e.g. an HTML document) 
has a URN (which is a URI) and can be readily retrieved from the Registry using a 
simple GET request (e.g. from a browser). 

In particular it would be useful to develop an ebRIM (V3.0) model for feature fusion.  
This would use ebRIM Associations, Packages and ClassificationScheme registry objects 
to model feature associations for feature fusion.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM is selected since it 
is the basis of the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several OGC members have 
developed commercial implementations. 

The Galdos implementation of CSW-ebRIM enables the automated transformation of the 
output from the registry using XSLT scripts, these scripts being associated to a given 
registry object type (e.g. audio clip).  Whenever a request is made for such an object, the 
transformation script is retrieved and automatically applied to the registry object and its 
associated repository items.  In this manner one can generate say an ATOM feed in which 
the registry descriptions are attached (embedded) together with the content (repository 
item). 

9.3.1.3 Adding geographic structure with TJS 

Many databases do not contain location as coordinates, but rather geographic identifiers 
are used, i.e., postal codes, municipality names, telephone area codes, or more special 
purpose identifiers such as school districts. This information appears unstructured to 
geospatial services that utilize geographic coordinates.  In order to use the data with 
identifiers, the database must be linked to a geospatial framework that provides a 
mapping from identifiers to coordinates. 

The OGC Georeferenced Table Joining Service (TJS) (OGC 10-072r2) offers a way to 
expose this data to other computers, so that it can be found and accessed, and a way to 
merge that data with the spatial data that describes the framework, in order to enable 
mapping or geospatial analysis. 



OGC 10-184 

46 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

TJS is a powerful open standard for bridging from databases without geographic 
coordinate-based structure to geospatial services that can fuse that information with 
geographic coordinate based information. 

9.3.2 Schema harmonization and adaptors 

OGC has extensive experience in working with information schemas, e.g., GML 
schemas.  Even so, OGC can continue to improve and refine methods for schema 
handling, harmonization and run-time mapping with adaptors.  Rules for mapping 
between schemas can be further defined.  These mappings can be used in advance and at 
run-time.  In maintaining data “closet to source”, different communities will continue to 
be use schemas optimized for local use.  In order to support sharing between 
communities, data adaptors– connectors – bridges – data transformations are needed to 
function in real time to map data from one schema to another.  

Relevant tools for GML handling have been developed in OWS Testbeds and elsewhere. 
For example the UML-to-GML tools like ShapeChange and the GML Validation tools 
are critical to improving handling of GML schemas. 

Further efforts on improving handling of associations is needed, in particular considering 
the primacy of associations to data fusion.  OGC has made use of XLink even while that 
specification has been in development and refinement.  Further refinements in OGC use 
of XLink should be considered. 

9.3.3 GML and Application Schemas 

GML Application Schemas are developing rapidly in many communities.  In some 
communities the GML Application Schemas have matured to become a basis for high 
degree of data interoperability.  Framework Data Sets have been defined by the USGS 
including GML application schemas.  INSPIRE is defining Data Specifications.   

Recently there has been discussion of increasing the use of political geography and soft 
fusion in decision making (See section 8.3.2.8).  This is also related to increasing the use 
of soft fusion and HUMINT in fusion.  

9.3.4 Discrete Global Grid System 

Spatial tessellations of the globe that do not have singularities of poles or date lines are 
valuable in many applications.  The tessellation or gridding system provides for complete 
coverage of the globe at multiple resolutions using geometric objects with desirable 
properties.  In addition to the geometries, an index of the locations based on the 
tessellations is needed for efficient processing, query, access, etc.   

The Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) is example of such a tessellation system.  The 
DGGS includes equal area cells that exhaustively cover the globe in closely packed 
hierarchical tessellations, each cell representing a homogenous value, with a uniquely 
identifier or indexing that allows for linear ordering, parent-child operations, and nearest 
neighbor algebraic operations.  

The DGGS as an Earth reference is designed for digital environments where storage, 
processing, transmission, discovery, visualization, aggregation, and transformations of 
multi sources of geo-referenced data are required.  



OGC 10-184 

Co

Conventional Earth references, based on a continuous analog model, are designed 
primarily for navigation and analytical geometry between points and using them within a 
digital environment introduces significant disadvantages and dependencies when multi-
source fusion is a goal.  

Quantizing values into a DGGS provides an efficient way of fusing data on-demand.   It 
has the mathematical properties to aggregate and decompose information described in 
each cell to coarser or infinitely finer resolutions – down to pixels.  Data can be pre-
processed to the DGGS or done at the source.  When pre-processed, individual data 
elements, as opposed to full data files, become searchable and extractable.  It can act like 
a spreadsheet of synchronized cell values taking multi-sources of data to describe the 
planet. 

The DGGS may provide a powerful new paradigm for enabling GEOINT2 and decision 
fusion supporting data discovery, automated integration, multi-source analysis, net-
centric dissemination, preservation and reuse within a standards based environment. 
Further, the future of GEOINT cannot presume an architecture dependant on a central 
decision fusion engine.  Information and the decision-makers are distributed, though the 
environment net- centric.  The properties of the DGGS within a net-centric reality 
provide opportunities to rely on the scalability of networks, variable node sizes and 
capabilities, distribution of services, and shared processing and storage.  

 
Figure 15 – Discrete Global Grid System (Source: PYXIS) 

 

So how might a DGGS be used in OGC standards?   

Tessellations of the Earth surface are considered in an annex to the OGC Abstract 
Specification, Topic 6 – Coverages.  The topic is included in that document for 

pyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 47
 



OGC 10-184 

48 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

discussion with discrete coverages.  Topic 6 lists several methods for discrete coverages. 
The specific discrete global grid ISEA3H (Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area aperture 3 
Hexagon Grid) advocated by PYXIS could be added to Topic 6 (also known as ISO 
19123). 

Using DGGS and in particular ISEA3H for discrete coverages would enable coverage 
processing that employs the ISEA3H structure for efficient processing.  Specific profiles 
of WCS, WPS and WCPS using ISEA3H could be defined.  PYXIS has internally 
developed a similar approach.  

Visualization of geographic data could also be more efficient using a DGGS. 
GeoBrowser developments in the Digital Earth activities early in this decade included 
major consideration of DGGS’s.  Use of DGGS in open geobrowser developments should 
be considered.  KML has answered an element of GeoBrowsers but more is needed. 

The ISEA3H DGGS has been published in multiple articles and is believed to be in the 
public domain concerning intellectual property. The PYXIS Innovation has developed 
and patented an efficient indexing scheme for DGGS.  Within OGC discussion of 
patented IP is subject to the OGC Intellectual Property Rights policy of the OGC.   

9.3.5 Registries for Feature/Object Fusion 

Section 8.4.5 describes an overall approach to supporting all categories of fusion using 
registries.  

In particular it would be useful to develop an ebRIM (V3.0) model for feature fusion.  
This would use ebRIM Associations, Packages and ClassificationScheme registry objects 
to model feature associations for feature fusion.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM is selected since it 
is the basis of the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several OGC members have 
developed commercial implementations. 
9.4 Recommendations 
The following recommendations for Object/Feature Fusion are based on the earlier 
material in this ER-2 and from the ER-1 of the Fusion Standards Study. 

9.4.1 Develop WPS Profiles for Geoprocessing Fusion 

OGC approved the WPS standard several years ago.  At the time of approval it was well 
known that the WPS Standard would serve as a framework for the deployment of 
numerous (100’s) of geoprocessing algorithms in distributed information networks.  The 
OGC is now undertaking the deployments of WPS coordinated through WPS Profiles.   A 
current challenge is to have consensus development of WPS profiles that encourages the 
highest level of interoperability.  Many of the WPS Profiles will be relevant to Fusion in 
all categories.   It is recommended that a strategy for development of WPS profiles be 
developed in the TC with the WPS SWG and deployed through several Interoperability 
Program initiatives. One such geoprocessing standard is WCPS. Harmonization with 
WPS through a WPS Application Profile should be pushed to completion. This should be 
part of an initiative to define canonical WPS extension approaches. 



OGC 10-184 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 49
 

9.4.2 Further develop rule-based geoprocessing to an OGC Best Practice 

Combining processing and rules services within a service-oriented architecture with 
workflow is an enabling technology for Fusion demonstrated in OWS-5. As part of the 
OWS-5 test bed a sample set of conflation rules were to implemented to prove the 
concept of rule-based conflation.  The OWS-5 implementation also used a Topology 
Quality Assessment Service (TQAS) in the workflow.  The rules can be inspected and 
compared and subsequently executed on a variety of workflow processing services. The 
technology demonstrated in OWS-5 should be developed further into an OGC Best 
Practice supported by existing OGC standards, and potentially new standards e.g., for 
Rules Schema. 

9.4.3 Develop approaches for fusing “unstructured” data 

This ER has identified many types of information that need to be handled in data fusion – 
much of the data is “unstructured” (Sections 8.3 and 9.3.1).  This is a broad filed that can 
benefit from experimentation in the OWS Testbed series.  Internet mashup methods are 
evolving quickly and should be tested with the more structured information types.  
Mechanisms exist for parsing non-geospatial data, linking, tagging, and organizing them 
to form “fused” information products packaged for sharing. Many of these capabilities 
are “locked-up” in desktop applications and tools, not easily accessible over networks or 
interoperable across implementations.  

9.4.4 Registries for Object/Feature Fusion 

It would be useful to develop an approach for using registries for feature fusion.  For 
example this could use ebRIM Associations, Packages and ClassificationScheme registry 
objects to model feature associations for feature fusion.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM is 
suggested since it is the basis of the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several 
OGC members have developed commercial implementations. 

9.4.5 Adding geographic structure with OGC Georeferenced TJS 

Apply the OGC Georeferenced Table Joining Service (TJS) to fuse information lacking 
geographic coordinate structure with geographic coordinate-based information using 
geospatial services. 

9.4.6 Further develop Authoritative Data Source Directory 

The Authoritative Data Source Directory (ADSD) sub-thread of OWS-7 explored the 
ability of a decision support system to provide a unified environment for searching and 
reviewing all these different types of information resources through a single interface. 
Identifying authoritativeness in data sets from less structured sources is more complex, 
and involves being able to account for authoritative concepts built up using the “wisdom 
of crowds”. OWS-7 was able to delve into these concepts in some depth, but there is still 
a wealth of research and prototyping experience required to fully explore the agenda set 
out in (OGC 10-086). 

9.4.7 Apply the OGC standards to Political Geography  

Development of GML Application Schemas for Political Geography, Soft Fusion and 
Human-centered information.  Services for creating the instances of political geography 



OGC 10-184 

50 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

data instances are also needed – a topic closely related to ADSD and fusion of 
unstructured data. 

9.4.8 Continue to improve methods for GML schema handling 

OGC has extensive experience in working with information schemas, e.g., GML 
schemas.  Even so, OGC can continue to improve and refine methods for schema 
handling, harmonization and run-time mapping with adaptors.  Further efforts on 
improving handling of associations are needed.   

9.4.9 Review Discrete Global Grid Systems with OGC  

Tessellation systems have been discussed previously in OGC in particular in the OGC 
Abstract Specification, Topic 6 Coverages and Topic 2 Coordinate Reference Systems.  
During OGC TC meetings, there have been recent discussions about the need for 
coordinate reference systems without singularities at the poles and date line.  The DGGS 
system presented by Pyxis has desirable properties and may meet the OGC needs.  It is 
recommended that discussion of DGGS be taken up with the OGC membership to 
determine if a movement toward consensus can be achieved. A testbed might be 
established which demonstrates the advantages of DGSS through a WCS. 

9.4.10 Develop semantic data models supporting feature fusion (Phase 1) 

Common data models and encoding patterns are needed for representing feature 
semantics, feature associations, and their geometry, topology, and temporal properties in 
standard ways for enabling interoperable Object/Feature fusion.  Elements of the data 
model include common ontologies, vocabularies and taxonomies, association types, link 
encoding mechanisms/patterns, and the means for publishing/sharing/processing of 
“fused” features. Clearly GML and O&M are the starting-point for an Object/Feature 
fusion model. Such models and patterns are essential for interoperable transformation and 
automated processing of data in fusion workflows. With stable and finite representations 
of features (i.e., their structure, associations, and semantics) derived from a common data 
model, come the means for discovery, transformation, and reasoning in support of 
compose-able and higher-order Object/Feature fusion capabilities needed to solve 
increasingly more complex problems and to share the results.  

9.4.11 Standardize metadata for provenance and uncertainty (Phase 1) 

Fusion is a hard problem in part because we are drowning in a volume of data from 
multiple sources, all with different levels of detail and uncertainty. The challenge in 
Object/Feature fusion is not getting data but making sense of them!  While it is important 
to minimize the introduction of uncertainty during processing and handling of data, it is 
equally important to recognize and quantitatively characterize the uncertainty in a result. 
Quantitative representations of uncertainty support provenance (history of a data product) 
within the feature lifecycle model.  The use of metadata, and specifically uncertainty 
metadata, must be shown in real-world/practical fusion scenarios. UncertML should be 
considered with evaluation of the Gaussian model for the variety of types of uncertainty. 
Demonstration of methods and tools for creating and interoperably using provenance and 
uncertainty metadata to support automation and improved (faster, valid, more accurate) 
fusion results are needed.

10 Observation (sensor) Fusion  
10.1 Introduction 
Observation Fusion considers sensor measurements of various observable properties to 
well characterized observations including uncertainties.  Fusion processes involve 
merging of multiple sensor measurements of the same phenomena (i.e. events of feature 
of interest) into a combined observation; and analysis of the measurement signature. 

Sensor fusion concerns the acquisition and exploitation of multiple measurements for the 
purpose of: 

• Obtaining a higher-level or more accurate measurement 
• Recognizing objects and events of interest 
• Determining properties of particular objects or events 

Standards for Observation Fusion are relatively mature; in particular the OGC Sensor 
Web Enablement (SWE) standards have been adopted as consensus standards with 
implementations for several years.   Currently the second major version of the SWE 
standards is being finalized in OGC.  The SWE architecture document provides a 
overview  [Botts, 2007] 

The Fusion Standards Study Phase 1 ER made recommendations regarding Observation 
Fusion.  The supporting discussion for those recommendations is not repeated here.  
Several of the Phase 1 recommendations were implemented in the OWS-7 Testbed. 
10.2 OWS-7 SFE Implementations 
The Sensor Fusion Enablement (SFE) thread of the OWS-7 Testbed implemented several 
recommendations from the Fusion Standards Study, Phase 1: 

• Discovery and access of dynamic sensors 
• Fusion of video from airborne and ground based platforms 

The OWS-7 SFE thread built on the SWE framework of standards, focusing on 
integrating the SWE interfaces and encodings with workflow and web processing 
services to perform dynamic sensor tracking and notification, and motion video change 
detection.  The SFE thread also continued work on the interoperability of SWE and 
Common CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) Sensor Interfaces 
(CCSI).

10.2.1 Dynamic Sensor Notification 

The OWS-7 SFE tested the tracking of sensors and notifying users based on a geographic 
Area of Interest (AOI).  In the context of OWS-7, tracking means receiving updates of a 
sensor’s position. Clients subscribed at a service to automatically be notified once the 
presence or absence of sensors over or within an AOI was determined.  This work 
included review of standards and specifications like OASIS Common Alerting Protocol 
(CAP), OGC Sensor Alert Service (SAS), OGC Web Notification Service (WNS) and the 
OWS-6 Event Architecture. Results are documented in OGC 10-061. 

10.2.2 Motion Imagery Discovery, Retrieval and Change Detection 

OWS-7 SFE activities on Motion Video Fusion included testing geolocating of motion 
video for display and processing, and change detection of motion video using Web 
Processing Service (WPS).   

Metadata was defined to tag geolocation of Motion Imagery (MI) for discovery, retrieval 
and linkage with other data sources over the same location, especially the metadata 
information required to geometrically co-register multiple motion images at pixel level so 
that data recorded at different times (e.g., different days) and/or by different providers for 
common or overlapped FOVs can be compared and pixel level changes among the 
different images can be accurately detected and delineated.   Results are documented in 
OGC 10-087. 

OWS-7 tested a change detection algorithm on two motion video streams. The web services 
of principle concern in this exploration were WPS, SOS and a SFE Integrated Client. 
Results are documented in OGC 10-036. 
10.3 Phase 2 Study results on Observations/Sensors 

10.3.1 WCS and WCPS 

Based on the current taxonomy in OGC, Coverages are Features.  Coverages are a type of 
feature where attributes have a value for every position within the geographic extent of 
the coverage.  Coverages support “mapping” (in the mathematical sense) from a spatial, 
temporal or spatiotemporal domain to feature attribute values where feature attribute 
types are common to all geographic positions within the domain. 

Coverages may be “authorized models” derived from hundreds or thousands of 
measurements or predictions and making use of some numerical model.  In this sense, 
coverages should be discussed under features. 

An observation is a representation of the act of observing or measurement.  The act of a 
person (or a satellite) taking a photograph is an example.  It has a time (time of the 
observing), location (of the observer), a result (what results from the act of observing) 

https://portal.opengeospatial.org/wiki/twiki/bin/view/OWS4/OWSIprs?template=viewprint&amp;sortcol=4;table=1;up=0#sorted_table


OGC 10-184

etc.  A coverage may then be the result of an observation (the photograph).  In this sense 
coverages should be discussed in Observations. 

Since the following discussion regarding coverages, WCS and WCPS mainly focus on 
coverages as derived from observations, the discussion is included in this Observation 
Fusion section. 

With WCS 2.0, an important step towards harmonization of coverage data across OGC 
has been accomplished. The coverage data structure and service definitions have been 
separated into the GML Application Schema for Coverages 1.0 Interface Standard and 
the WCS 2.0. This allows coverages to float freely between different services.  

The specification set, which was the first to follow OGC’s new core/extension paradigm, 
is distinguished by several properties: 

- support for multi-dimensional raster data, plus a broad range of further coverage 
types, such as curvilinear grids and point clouds; 

- crisp and easy to understand for both implementers and users; 
- flexible and adaptive to a broad range of different domains, such as remote sensing, 

web mapping, climate and ocean research, and geology; 
- allowing for efficient and scalable implementations, to multi-Terabyte object access; 
- harmonized with Geography Markup Language (GML) and Sensor Web Enablement 

(SWE); 
- reflecting OGC’s core/extension model; and 
- improved testability of the specification. 
WCS 2.0 has been developed based on lots of stakeholder consultations, requirements 
elicitation workshops, and active participation by many scientific disciplines (remote 
sensing, atmospheric research, ocean research, astrophysics, …), as well as industry, and 
governmental bodies. In parallel, experiments on implementation feasibility have been 
conducted. Currently, a WCS Earth Observation Application Profile is under work. 

Further, the coverage model is harmonized with GML and SWE Common; harmonization 
with WPS and further standards are next steps. Hence, for the first time OGC has one 
coherent, ubiquitously usable coverage definition. For GML 4.0 an integration of this 
coverage model is foreseen by the GML group. 

The Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) Interface Standard allows ad-hoc 
filtering, processing, extraction, and analysis of multi-dimensional raster coverages. A 
protocol-neutral language is defined which can be embedded into both WCS and WPS. 
This language allows to filter and process sensor, image, and statistics coverages like 

- 1-D in-situ sensor time series 
- 2-D ortho images 
- 3-D image time series (x/y/t) and geological data (x/y/z) 
- 4-D climate and ocean data (x/y/z/t) 
- “abstract coverages” which additionally have non-spatiotemporal axes. 
Heterogeneous coverages can be combined in one request, enabling multi-sensor fusion. 
The language is safe in that no non-terminating requests can be sent, thereby preventing a 
class of denial-of-service attacks.

The following example shows the principle: "From MODIS scenes M1, M2, and M3, the 
absolute of the difference between red and nir, in HDF-EOS, but only those where nir 
exceeds 127 somewhere inside region R”: 

for $c in ( M1, M2, M3 ), 
     $r in ( R ) 
where 
    some( $c.nir > 127 and $r ) 
return  
    encode( abs( $c.red - $c.nir ), "hdf“ ) 

10.3.2 Motion Imagery 

The integration of georeferenced motion video into a decision fusion environment, 
specifically as prescribed by Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB)2 specifications, 
was identified as a focal point of future work and specifically a topic for OWS-8. The 
integration should be through a distributed, streaming, services based environment. 

The MISB standards are emerging as the defacto standards for motion video. Further 
development will depend upon broader implementation. Inclusion of MISB access in an 
initiative like OWS-8 could serve to further exercise the standard and increase its profile 
in the intelligence community with all participants. Intergraph and other OGC members 
have the technology to support these developments. 

Distributed access to MISB formatted data through a services framework specified by 
existing OGC standards such as SWE and WCS should be tested in OWS-8.  In terms of 
executing on such an exercise, Intergraph can bring to the table high level COTS with a 
SWE / WCS access. A second key component of any test bed activity can be Intergraph’s 
Motion Video Analyst Professional (MVAP) that can access WMS, WFS and SWE data 
sources.  This platform would allow for the examination and investigation of various 
decision fusion scenarios including how to better exploit motion video when it is 
delivered in a geospatial context.  WPS should be included to perform motion video 
processing. 

Specific topics identified in the Fusion Study Workshop were 

o MISB coordination 
o Motion imagery metadata   
o Video Search and Annotation 
o WPS for near real-time quality improvement of MISB video feeds 

10.3.3 Fusion scenario:  Flight path generation from hotspots  

Figure 16 sketches a scenario using open standards for fusion.  Multi-INT information is 
used to develop a flight path for a UAV.  SIGINT information based upon cellular phone 
traffic is geotagged.  The collection of points can be processed into a density 
representation that can be used to command a UAV flight path.  Geotagging can be done 
using the OGC Georeferenced Table Joining Service (TJS) standard.  The density

Co

representation can be done using OGC WPS standard.  Tasking the UAV can be done 
using the OGC SPS standard.

10.3.4 Security and GeoDRM for Observations 

Security and GeoDRM are different topics that typically get discussed at the same time as 
they did at the Fusion Workshop. 

Secure SWE Architecture was a development in previous OWS Testbeds.  The Fusion 
Workshop recommended the further development of a security architecture (mission- and 
role-based) to enable observation fusion.  Topics include multi-level authentication and 
control over imagery data collection 

GeoDRM for data can also affect data fusion.  For example, providing interoperable 
mechanisms for handling of licenses for commercial imagery would make the imagery 
more widely available.   

10.3.5 Registries for Observation Fusion 

Section 8.4.5 describes an overall approach to supporting all categories of fusion using 
registries.  

In particular it would be useful to develop an ebRIM (V3.0) model for observation 
fusion.  This would use ebRIM Associations, Packages and ClassificationScheme registry 
objects to model observation associations for observation fusion.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM 
is selected since it is the basis of the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several 
OGC members have developed commercial implementations.

10.3.6 Mobile clients and soft fusion 

The OGC Board of Directors identified the Mobile Internet as a “ripe issue” to be 
addressed by the consortium.  It is clear that mobile communications are moving beyond 
the walled gardens of the cellular providers allowing for development similar to the wired 
Internet.   OGC is assessing standards that make up the Mobile Internet and as 
appropriate will begin developing open geospatial standards tuned to the mobile 
environment. 

Mobile devices provide access to sensors both in the handheld device and accessed 
within a personal area network (PAN) enabled by the mobile device.  The sensed data is 
available for fusion locally as well as through the Internet.  The mobile platform can host 
applications that fuse the observations from the local sensors using resident applications.  
Further, the mobile device serves as a gateway from the PAN-based local sensor network 
to the Internet for which the OGC SWE standards provide for interoperability.   
Sensors accessed through mobile Internet devices supports an element of “Soft Fusion” 
identified by [Hall, 2008] (see also Section 8.3.1.3) 
10.4 Recommendations 
Recommendations for further development of Observation Fusion based on open 
standards: 

10.4.1 Coverage fusion based on WCS 2.0, WCPS and GML. 

WCS is a basic data access service, whereas WCPS adds advanced processing 
capabilities, including multi-coverage fusion. Both deliver coverages, which can be 
consumed further by other tools, or – where the result can meaningfully be interpreted as 
an image – can be displayed to humans. This allows for a staged deployment, depending 
on the level of server-side processing capabilities. Actually, WCPS more and more turns 
out to be a link between WPS, WCS, SWE, also by lining up with OGC's further 
query/filter languages. 

Version 2.0 of the OGC Web Coverage Service has been adopted by the OGC 
membership.  WCS 2.0 provides the basis for defining a new level of interoperability of 
geographic coverages.  Profiles of WCS 2.0 should be developed to meet the needs of 
several different communities while still seeking the minimum number of standards – 
more profiles means less interoperability.  Fusion of coverages will be enabled by use of 
WCS 2.0 in combination with the WPS and WCPS.  The newly approved GML schema 
for coverages will also enable a higher degree of coverage fusion. 

It is recommended to assess multi-coverage fusion capabilities involving both WCS and 
WCPS in a scenario with different, heterogeneous raster types, for example 1-D sensor 
time series, 2-D hyperspectral remote sensing data and bathymetry/elevation data, 3-D 
EO time series, 4-D climate data. Server-side processing needs to include sufficiently 
complex queries, taken from real-life examples, to make them convincing to domain 
experts. All coverages delivered must be encoded following the GML Application 
Schema for Coverages (09-164r1) in combination with the (currently drafted) coverage 
formats like GeoTIFF, NetCDF, and JPEG2000. To this end, the WCPS specification 
should be updated to make use of this new standard.  



OGC 10-184 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 57
 

It is recommended to establish proof-of-concept services for non-raster coverages. A 
whole new set of coverage types has been gained by aligning with GML, but little is 
known about serving non-grid coverages in an OGC environment. Emphasis should not 
be on "yes, we can serve these data too" (this would repeat GALEON IE and recent 
Ocean activities, ending up in serving format X with so-so WCS conformance), but an 
offering of representative data strictly adherent to the WCS 2.0 model. 

It is recommended to conduct an experiment on the integration of workflow, 
processing, and data access services. Initial work has been performed by NASA on 
WCPS as a value-adding ground/space interface, which may serve as a role model and/or 
basis for continuation. For example, a (simulated) on-board WCPS might deliver some 
derived data, which are fed, via WCS-T, into a ground-based WCS. WCPS Change 
Requests submitted NASA and other users should be considered for incorporation in the 
standard. 

It is recommended to complete the WPS Application Profile fusing coverages, via 
WCPS, into WPS. As this very much depends on progress with the WPS 2.0 
specification, this needs to be performed in close contact with the WPS.SWG. The 
concept of offering the coverage request language through different protocols, which 
fosters harmonization between WCS and WPS, should be evaluated and demonstrated. 

It is recommended to develop WCS extensions which do not have assignments for now, 
among them EPSG coordinate handling, scaling & interpolation, and range subsetting 
("band selection"). Existing WCS 1.1 extensions (WCS-T, WCPS) need to be carried 
over to WCS 2.0. 

It is recommended to pursue a WCS 2.0 CITE conformance testbed in order to obtain a 
stable basis for future mission-critical implementations of coverage fusion tools. 

Finally, one outcome of such activities should be best practices on WCS 2.0 use to 
support community uptake. 

10.4.2 Further develop Events in the OWS Architecture 

Recent OWS testbeds have developed the initial approach for adding events to the OWS 
architecture.   Events and alerts were initially treated in SWE through the definition of 
SAS, but events have a wider applicability than just SWE.  OWS-7 advanced an event 
architecture and event service concepts and identified further work to be done.  Several 
items of further work are described in this recommendation.  

Within SWE domain, the event architecture has been used for the discovery and access of 
dynamic sensors.  This activity should be continued. It is vital for timely recognition of 
situation awareness that we are able to readily discover and access information about 
dynamic sensor assets that might be useful for us, to access observations or receive alerts 
from these systems in a readily meaningful and usable encoding, and to easily task these 
systems to provide much needed observations in order to fill gaps in our knowledge. 
Currently, timely discovery and access to highly dynamic assets is currently challenging 
at best.  Investigating alternatives for improving rapid discovery and access to highly-
dynamic are encouraged, including investigations into non-traditional technologies such 
as P2P and the query of web services that are closer upstream to the sensor system.    



OGC 10-184 

58 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium
 

Definitions for events, alerts and warnings need to be developed further.  An event is an 
action that occurs at an instant or over an interval of time [ISO 19136].  With event as the 
more general class, definitions for the terms alert and warning can be developed.  These 
definitions should be done in coordination with the standards bodies, e.g., OASIS, and 
the programs, e.g., CMAS, that are actively working on these definitions as well.  
Inherent to the OGC work will be the notion of location for events, alerts, and warnings. 

Event Service Workflows were identified in OWS-7 for further development. The use 
cases tested in OWS-7 concentrated on delivering events that were detected or derived by 
an Event Service to a client(s). The clients were then responsible for reacting as they see 
fit. To facilitate automation of workflows – like the invocation of a change detection 
service upon receipt of an area-of-interest entry event – the community should test the 
integration of event services in automated processing environments, leveraging available 
functionality from workflow and chaining services. Tools could also be developed or 
tested to facilitate this kind of integration. 

SWE Events & Event Channels were identified in OWS-7 for further development.  
The work started in the OWS-6 SWE thread to define an OGC Event Architecture was 
continued in the OWS-7 Event Architecture cross thread. The results show that the 
definition of event types as well as event channels is specific to certain application 
domains. SWE 2.0 service specifications like the SWE Service Model or Sensor Planning 
Service already started with that work. However, further work in the area of eventing in 
Sensor Web applications should consider defining events and channels that are of 
common use. For example, sensor status update events would be of interest. Event 
channels where observations are posted that are made by certain types of sensors, that 
contain certain observed properties or that contain results that apply to certain geographic 
regions could also be beneficial (e.g. performance wise). 

10.4.3 Motion Imagery and location – coordinated with MISB 

Beginning with OWS-4, OGC initiatives have addressed motion imagery coming from 
sensors on-board moving platforms.  Further work was done in OWS-7 and was 
discussed extensively in the Fusion Workshop. 

Motion imagery change detection was developed in OWS-7 with further development 
needs identified.  OWS-7 SFE was a relatively controlled experiment environment for 
motion imagery and change detection. More experiments will be needed to test use cases 
with less a prior knowledge on motion imagery collection. The ability to consume near 
real-time video at higher frame rates to evaluate a more real-world environment.   Further 
development of imagery metadata to support the services is needed. 

MISB and OGC should undertake coordinated development of Motion Imagery as to 
location elements.  The integration of georeferenced motion video into a decision fusion 
environment, specifically as prescribed by MISB specifications, is recommended.  
Inclusion of MISB access in an initiative like OWS-8 could serve to further exercise the 
standard and increase its profile in the intelligence community with all participants. 
Intergraph and other OGC members have the technology to support these developments 
using OWS services.   



OGC 10-184 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium 59
 

A motion video fusion scenario was identified in the workshop including flight path 
generation from hotspots.  The scenario presented at the workshop enabled tasking of a 
UAV based on SIGINT information from geotagged cellular phone traffic. 

10.4.4 Apply SWE to Mobile Internet 

Mobile devices connected to the Internet are becoming the main method for access to the 
Internet.  Use of mobile communications is vital to scaling to the trillions of sensors to be 
deployed in the near future.  Scaling access to sensors will require the techniques like in 
SWE to access sensors that have never been seen before.  Application of the SWE 
services to sensors connected to the Internet via mobile communications including 
personal area sensor networks should be undertaken.  

10.4.5 Further develop Secure Sensor Web  

Previous testbeds defined a Secure Sensor Web architecture and tested several elements 
of the architecture.  Application of widely adopted security standards to SWE is 
important to the diffusion and uptake of SWE broadly into differing security 
administration domains.  OGC makes use of standards for security from other standards 
organizations.  Further testing and refinement of the results reported in the OWS-6 
Secure Sensor Web ER [OGC 08-176] should be undertaken. 

10.4.6 Registries for Sensor/Observation Fusion 

Section 8.4.5 describes an overall approach to supporting all categories of fusion using 
registries.  

In particular it would be useful to develop an ebRIM (V3.0) model for observation 
fusion.  This would use ebRIM Associations, Packages and ClassificationScheme registry 
objects to model observation associations for observation fusion.  Version 3.0 of ebRIM 
is selected since it is the basis of the OGC CSW-ebRIM specification for which several 
OGC members have developed commercial implementations. 

10.4.7 Online community sanctioned definitions for sensor terms (Phase 1) 

The creation of sanctioned definitions and semantics within the sensor and data fusion 
communities is essential. Some activities are already underway in some communities, 
while many completed works exist in published documents. These efforts should be 
harmonized resulting in dictionaries and ontologies that are resolvable online and thus 
able to be utilized within metadata tags for sensor, observation, and process descriptions. 

10.4.8 Harmonization of the process of precise geolocation (Phase 1) 

Harmonization of the process of precise geolocation has been improving with the efforts 
of the Community Sensor Model (CSM) Working Group, the near completion of the ISO 
19130 standards, based on CSM, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of encoding 
these models into SensorML. Such models have been shown to be applicable to remote 
sensors on-board satellite, aircraft, ship, mobile ground-based vehicles, and immobile 
stations. We feel that these efforts should continue and become more widely applied 
throughout the remote sensing communities. 



OGC 10-184

10.4.9 Characterizing and propagating uncertainty of measurements (Phase 1) 

All measured and processed results include a certain degree of uncertainty. No 
measurement, no recognition of an object or event, and no determination of an object’s 
properties are free from possible error and uncertainty. Errors and uncertainty can arise 
from inevitable limitations in the sensor systems, from errors introduced or propagated 
during the processing of the data, or in act of comparing observations with signatures 
taken under varying environmental conditions.  Thus, while it is important to minimize 
uncertainty, recognizing the amount of uncertainty in a result is equally important.  It is 
recommended that efforts be taken to define terms of uncertainty, to insure the inclusion 
of values of uncertainty within sensor and observations metadata, and to determine 
algorithms for propagating error through processing algorithms or workflows. 

10.4.10 Increasing use of geometric and electromagnetic signatures (Phase 1) 

Since geometric and electromagnetic signatures can play a significant role in recognizing 
objects and events from measurements, and in determining their properties, it is important 
that the current state of managing signatures be improved. This includes expecting 
signatures to be treated as we should treat observations. They should be provided with a 
complete description of the signature’s lineage including a robust the sensor and process 
descriptions, measures of uncertainty, and a description of the environmental conditions 
under which they were measured. They should also utilize standardized terms and 
semantics, and should be easily discoverable and accessible. Furthermore when such 
information is provided for all observations, it can enable new paradigms for creating 
new signatures based on large numbers of observations taken under varying conditions.
