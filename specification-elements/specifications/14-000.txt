Abstract 

This activity is part of OGC Testbed 10. The aviation thread was focused on developing 
and demonstrating the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) and 
the Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM), building on the work accomplished in 
prior testbeds to advance the applications of OGC Web Services standards in next gen-
eration air traffic management systems to support European and US aviation moderniza-
tion programs 

This document summarizes technical work relating to the enhancement of the GML 3.2.1 
conformance test suite in accord with the requirements in the OWS-10 RFQ, Annex B1, 
section 6.3.6: “GML for Aviation Compliance Test Suite + GML for Aviation Conform-
ance Testing ER”. The essential aim is to advance compliance with respect to the use of 
GML geometry representations in aviation (AIXM) data.

5 Overview 

The test development work focused on validating geometry representations commonly 
appearing in AIXM 5.1 data sets that adhere to the AIXM-GML profile (OGC 12-028). 
In particular, tests were developed for the following GML and AIXM geometry elements: 

– gml:Point (aixm:Point, aixm:ElevatedPoint) 
– gml:Curve (aixm:Curve, aixm:ElevatedCurve) 
– gml:OrientableCurve 
– gml:CompositeCurve 
– gml:Surface (aixm:Surface, aixm:ElevatedSurface) 

NOTE  The following curve segments are included in the AIXM-GML profile: 
gml:ArcByCenterPoint, gml:CircleByCenterPoint, gml:Arc, gml;Circle, 
gml:GeodesicString, gml:Geodesic, gml: LineStringSegment. 

The geometry elements covered by the tests are shown in Figure 1. It is important to note 
that the tests are not tied to any particular application domain. The validator will check 
all instances of the standard GML geometry elements plus any application-defined geom-
etries that can substitute for them; the application schemas are inspected to discover these 
additional geometry elements.

Figure 1: Geometry type coverage 

The fundamental goal was to extend the existing GML 3.2.1 conformance test suite to 
perform more thorough checking that goes beyond schema validation. The test assertions 
were gleaned from the documents identified in Figure 2, where a dependency relationship 
is depicted as a dashed line with an open arrow.

The new tests were added to the org.opengis.cite.iso19136.data.spatial 
package, which contains the classes listed below2. 

– PointTests 
– CurveTests 
– CompositeCurveTests 
– SurfaceTests 
– EnvelopeTests 
– GeometryAssert 

6 Test assertions 

6.1 Valid CRS reference 

A geometry (or envelope) element must have a known CRS reference; the value of the 
srsName attribute is an absolute URI for which one of the following conditions is true: 

1. it identifies a "well-known" CRS definition (Note 1), or 
2. it refers to a CRS definition. 

NOTE  The 'urn' or 'http' URI schemes may be used to identify a CRS in accord with 
OGC 09-048r3 (e.g. "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"). 

A geometry element (but not an envelope) may inherit its CRS reference from a broader 
spatial context. If a geometry element does not explicitly carry the srsName attribute, 
then it shall be effectively inherited from either:  

a. the nearest ancestor geometry (aggregate) that has the srsName attribute, or  
b. the gml:boundedBy/gml:Envelope element in the containing feature instance. 

The source documents are listed below. 

– urn:ogc:doc:dp:12-028:clause:3.2 
– urn:iso:std:iso:19136:clause:9.10,10.1.3.2 
– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.2.2.17 

6.2 Valid coordinates 

A geometry (or envelope) element must satisfy all of the following conditions: 

1. length of coordinate tuple = CRS dimension 
2. it lies within (is covered by) the valid area of the associated CRS 

NOTE  The last constraint will serve to detect obvious cases where the axis order is 
incorrect (for example, a position expressed in EPSG 4326 as -122.22, 50.55). 

                                                

2 The source code may be obtained from the OGC CITE repository.

The source documents are listed below. 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.2.2.10 

6.3 Valid envelope positions 

The coordinates of the lower corner must be less than the coordinates of the upper corner, 
where the coordinate tuples are compared item by item: lowerCorner < upperCorner. 

The source documents are listed below. 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19136:clause:10.1.4.6 
– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.4.3.2,6.4.3.3 

6.4 Curve segments 

A curve must satisfy all of the following conditions: 

1. the curve has one or more segments; 
2. the segments are contiguous (end point of each segment except the last being the 

start point of the next). 

The source documents are listed below. 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19136:clause:10.4.5 
– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.3.16.1 

6.5 Surface boundary (components) 

Each ring composing the boundary of a surface must be:  

1. simple (does not self-intersect);  
2. closed (forms a cycle such that the ends are identical).  

The source documents are listed below. 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19136:clause:10.5.11.1 
– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.3.6 

6.6 Surface boundary (topology) 

Each interior ring must be covered by the surface delimited by the exterior boundary (if it 
exists). The rings may touch at a tangent point. 

The source documents are listed below. 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19136:clause:10.5.5 



OGC 14-000 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 7 
 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.3.7.2 

6.7 Surface orientation 

A surface has an "up" direction in terms of the upward (positive) normal, which is the 
side of the surface from which the exterior boundary appears counterclockwise and inte-
rior boundaries are traversed in a clockwise manner. In essence, the interior is always to 
the left of a boundary curve (Figure 3). 

The source documents are listed below: 

– urn:iso:std:iso:19136:clause:10.5.5 
– urn:iso:std:iso:19107:clause:6.3.17.1,6.4.33.2 

7 Test execution 

7.1 Web interface 

The geometry tests were implemented as extensions of the GML 3.2.1 conformance test 
suite. The suite may be run using the official OGC test harness, TEAM-Engine 4.0. The 
OGC maintains a testing facility that provides access to the latest test suites at this loca-
tion: <http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2/>. 

The interface provided by the TEAM-Engine web application presents a form wherein 
the location of the instance document to be validated is specified by an absolute URI val-
ue. Alternatively, the GML document may be uploaded for validation (Figure 4).

Figure 4: Test execution (web interface) 

7.2 REST API 

A REST API provides an alternative means of executing the test suite by submitting a 
GET request to the test controller endpoint. The test run arguments are summarized in  
Table 1. The Obligation descriptor can have the following values: M (mandatory), O (op-
tional), or C (conditional). 

Table 1 — Test run arguments 

Name Type Obligation Description 

xsd URI C (required if ‘gml’ is not 
supplied) 

Refers to a GML application schemaa 

gml URI C (required if ‘xsd’ is not 
supplied) 

Refers to a representation of a GML 
data instancea 

sch URI O Refers to a Schematron schemab 

a. Ampersand ('&') characters appearing within a query parameter value must be percent-encoded as 
%26. 

b. A Schematron schema that defines supplementary data constraints. See ISO 19757-3:2006. 

  



OGC 14-000 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 9 
 

The request URI has the following form (substitute the appropriate host name and port 
number for the actual test harness): 

http://host:port/teamengine/rest/suites/gml/3.2.1-r15/run?gml=uri 

where uri is an absolute URI that refers to the instance document to be validated; the 
‘http’ and ‘file’ URI schemes are acceptable. The result entity is an XML document with 
<testng-results> as the document element. 

8 Test results (Donlon data set) 

The test suite was run against the latest “Donlon” data set (updated on 2014-03-19). Sev-
eral assertion errors were reported; these are summarized below along with suggestions 
for resolving the errors. 

8.1 validateMetadataProperties test 

Property value has minOccurs = 0. Property type definition must 
contain the @xlink:href attribute: 
{http://www.aixm.aero/schema/5.1}FeatureMetadataPropertyType 

The type definition is listed below (the particle cardinality constraint is highlighted). 

<complexType name="FeatureMetadataPropertyType"> 
  <complexContent> 
    <extension base="gml:AbstractMetadataPropertyType"> 
      <sequence minOccurs="0"> 
        <element ref="gmd:MD_Metadata"/> 
      </sequence> 
    </extension> 
  </complexContent> 
</complexType> 
 
Since the xs:sequence model group has minOccurs="0", the @xlink:href attribute decla-
ration is expected so as to allow for a remote value; it is an error if a non-nillable property 
has no value. If the intent is to permit only in-line content (i.e. a child element), then this 
minOccurs constraint should be removed, since the property declaration itself already has 
minOccurs="0". 

<complexType name="AbstractAIXMFeatureType" abstract="true"> 
  <complexContent> 
    <extension base="aixm:AbstractAIXMFeatureBaseType"> 
      <sequence> 
        <element name="featureMetadata"  
         type="aixm:FeatureMetadataPropertyType" minOccurs="0"/> 
      </sequence> 
    </extension> 
  </complexContent> 
</complexType> 



OGC 14-000 

10 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 
This issue applies to all of the base metadata property types defined in the AIXM 
namespace (see schema AIXM_AbstractGML_ObjectTypesFeatures.xsd): 

 FeatureMetadataPropertyType 
 FeatureTimeSliceMetadataPropertyType 
 MessageMetadataPropertyType 

8.2 verifyFeatureMemberProperties 

Expected sequence compositor in non-empty property type 
{http://www.aixm.aero/schema/5.1/message}BasicMessageMemberAIXMPropertyType 

This property type definition uses the xs:choice compositor: 

<complexType name="BasicMessageMemberAIXMPropertyType"> 
  <complexContent> 
    <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureMemberType"> 
      <choice> 
        <element ref="aixm:AbstractAIXMFeature"/> 
      </choice> 
      <attributeGroup ref="gml:AssociationAttributeGroup"/> 
    </extension> 
  </complexContent> 
</complexType> 

However, there is really no choice here and the GML property type patterns that must be 
adhered to (see ISO 19136, cl. 7.2.3) all use the xs:sequence compositor. 

8.3 validSurfaceBoundary test 

In GML ring: Failed to unmarshal GML geometry from resource at 
urn:uuid:6118ba76-0d46-4ba7-af63-17f29755e890 

There is no standard mechanism for resolving a URN (Uniform Resource Name). The 
URN value occurs in a gml:curveMember property that refers to a boundary component 
of the geometry element aixm:Surface[@gml:id="ID_11364"]: 

<gml:curveMember xlink:href="urn:uuid:6118ba76-0d46-4ba7-af63-17f29755e890" 
xlink:title="along the State border"/> 

Inserting the referenced curve geometry would be the simplest means of fixing the error. 
Note that as stated in ISO 19136, cl. 8.1 it is an error if a GML property value cannot be 
dereferenced: 

"The appearance of an xlink:href on a GML property indicates that the value of the prop-
erty shall be found by traversing the link, that is the value is pointed to by the value of the 
xlink:href attribute." 



OGC 14-000

8.4 validSurfaceOrientation test 

Exterior boundary of surface with @gml:id='SFIRAMSWELL' is not oriented CCW with 
respect to the up-normal. 

The fix here is to just reverse the orientation of the constituent curve member,  
gml:Curve[@gml:id="CFIRAMSWELL"]. The coordinate list (gml:posList) indicates a 
clockwise ordering. 

<gml:Curve gml:id="CFIRAMSWELL"> 
  <gml:segments> 
    <gml:GeodesicString> 
      <gml:posList>57.0833333333333 -40.0
