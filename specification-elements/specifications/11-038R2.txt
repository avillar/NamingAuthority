Abstract 

When there are multiple valid representations for the same information, humans may 

understand and ignore gratuitous differences.  For example, a human reader recognizes 

that the strings "Temperature" and "temperature" very likely refer to the same quantity.  It 

is impractical, however, to develop software that has to deal with multiple representations 

of the same information. A convention that declares one representation is favored above 

others (even though all representations may be technically equivalent) makes 

interoperable software practical, because it only needs to deal with one way to represent 

the information. 

Standard data models and data storage formats allow for the creation of data conventions 

that foster this interoperability. A data model is an abstract conceptual layer that 

describes how different types of data should be represented, independent of any particular 

software application or hardware configuration. A data format is a description of how 

data organized according to a particular data model should be stored on physical storage 

media by software applications. Data conventions can then build upon the infrastructure 

provided by the data model and data format to imbue specific data collections with 

meaning that is understood by a wide variety of software applications. 

This standard deals with enhancements to the netCDF (Network Common Data Form) 

data model for array-oriented scientific data.. 

Two important data models for netCDF are: 

 the “classic” netCDF model, used for netCDF-3 and earlier versions 

 an enhanced data model, used in netCDF-4 and later versions. 

The netCDF classic data model is defined in OGC 10-091r3, “NetCDF Core.”   

This document specifies a netCDF extension standard for the enhanced data model. The 

OGC netCDF encoding supports electronic encoding of geospatial data, specifically 

digital geospatial information representing space- and time-varying phenomena. 

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a data model for array-oriented scientific data.  

The netCDF classic data model is specified in the netCDF core specification.  This 

standard specifies the enhanced data model.  A freely distributed collection of access 

libraries implementing support for that data model in a machine-independent format are 

available. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and format support the creation, access, and 

sharing of multi-dimensional scientific data.

1. Scope 

NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a data model for array-oriented scientific 

data. There is a freely distributed collection of access libraries implementing support for 

that data model in a machine-independent format. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and 

format support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data. 

Background information regarding the overall landscape of netCDF standards is 

presented in the CF-netCDF Primer, OGC 10-091r3, “CF-netCDF: Core and Extensions.” 

This standard is an extension to the core specification for the netCDF Classic data model 

in OGC 10-090r3, “NetCDF Core.”   

This document specifies the netCDF Enhanced Data Model. 

2. Conformance 

This Standard defines the netCDF enhanced data model.  

Standardization targets are netCDF implementations (currently: encodings).  

This document establishes a single requirements class, netcdf-enhanced, of  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/req/netcdf-enhanced  

with a single pertaining conformance class, netcdf enhanced, with URI  

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf/1.0/conf/netcdf-enhanced.  

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned 

by the standard identified as http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0 . 

Annex A (normative) specifies conformance tests which shall be exercised by any 

encoded dataset claiming to implement an OGC netCDF encoding. 

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in 

Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for 

testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC 

Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site

.

3. References 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this 

text, constitute provisions of this document. For dated references, subsequent 

amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated 

references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies. 

The netCDF classic data model is defined in OGC 10-091r3, “NetCDF Core.”  The 

standard defined in this document is an extension to that core specification.   

Consequently all provisions stated in the NetCDF Core apply to the NetCDF Enhanced 

Data Model defined herein. 

In addition to the normative reference noted above, portions of this document are taken 

from the Unidata NetCDF User’s Guide 

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf.html 

and from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Standards Process Group (SPG) 

document ESDS-RFC-022, NetCDF-4/HDF5 File Format,  

http://earthdata.nasa.gov/our-community/esdswg/standards-process-spg/rfc/esds-rfc-022 

4. Terms and Definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is 

based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 

International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 

to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard. 

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.  

These definitions are all of definition type “property.” The base URI to be used with the 

URI tokens is:  

 http://www.opengis.net/def/property/netcdf/1.0/{URI_token} 

Note: 
The netCDF data types are based on the IETF XDR standard 

(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506). Because the XDR standard requires at least 4 bytes 

for every data value, netCDF instead packs arrays of byte and short data types in order to 

improve storage efficiency.

4.1  
byte* 

A byte is an eight-bit integer.  The byte type differs from the char type in that it is 

intended for eight-bit data, and the zero byte has no special significance, as it may for 

character data.  URI token: byte. 

4.2  
char* 

A char is an 8-bit byte that contains uninterpreted character data. Typically a char 

contains a 7-bit ASCII character, but the character encoding is application-specific. URI 

token: char. 

4.3  
compound type 

Compound types group together named fields (also called "members"), that may be of 

different types, into a structure that may be accessed as a unit. It has a fixed total size. It 

consists of zero or more named members that do not overlap with other members. 

 Each member has a name distinct from other members. 

 Each member has its own datatype. 

 Each member is referenced by an index number between zero and N-1, where N 
is the number of members in the compound datatype. 

 Each member has a fixed byte offset, which is the first byte (smallest byte 
address) of that member in the compound datatype. 

 In addition to other other user-defined data types or atomic datatypes, a member 
can be a small fixed-size array of any type with up to four fixed-size 

“dimensions” (not associated with named netCDF dimensions). 

URI token: compoundType. 

4.4  
double* 

A double is an IEEE double-precision floating point (64 bits.).  The double type can hold 

values between about -1.7+308 and 1.7+308, with external representation as 64-bit IEEE 

standard normalized double-precision, floating-point numbers. URI token: double. 

4.5  
enumerated (enum) type 

Enumerated types are used to represent a small number of named values more concisely 

than strings.  URI token: enumeratedType.

4.6  
float* 

A float is an IEEE single-precision floating point (32 bits).  The float type can hold 

values between about -3.4+38 and 3.4+38, with external representation as 32-bit IEEE 

normalized single-precision floating-point numbers. URI token: float. 

4.7  
group 

A group provides a nested scope for names.  URI token: group. 

4.8

An int is a 32-bit signed integer.  An int can hold values between -2147483648 and 

2147483647.  URI token: int 

4.9  
int64 

An int64 is an eight-byte signed integer.   An int64 can hold values between -

9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807.  URI token: int64. 

4.10  
long* 

The long type is deprecated.  It is synonymous with int.  URI token: long. 

4.11  
opaque type 

Opaque is a collection of objects of a known size.  Each object is the same size.  Nothing 

is known to netCDF about the contents of these blobs of data, except their size in bytes, 

and the name of the type. URI token: opaqueType. 

 

4.12  
real* 

The real type is synonymous with float.  URI token: real. 

4.13  
short* 

A short is a 16-bit signed integer.  A short holds values between -32768 and 32767.  URI 

token: short. 

4.14  
string 

A string is a variable-length array of Unicode characters. A string is stored in a netCDF 

file as UTF-8 encoded Unicode. URI token: string.

4.15  
unsigned int 

An unsigned int is a 32-bit unsigned integer.  An unsigned int holds values between 0 and 

4294967296.  URI token: unsignedInt

0 and 65536.  URI token:  unsignedShort. 

4.18  
user defined type 

User defined types are: compound, enumerated, variable-length, and opaque.  URI token: 

userDefinedType. 

4.19  
variable length type 

The variable length type represents a one-dimensional array of variable length.  URI 

token:  variableLengthType. 

*Note that, for purposes of completeness and readability, the definitions of all the 

primitive data types are included here.  However, char, byte, short, double, float, and real 

are actually part of the netCDF classic data model and hence are part of the core netCDF 

specification.

6. Clauses not Containing Normative Material 

There are no clauses with non normative material. 

7. Clauses containing normative material 

The netCDF enhanced data model adds Groups and User-Defined Types to the classic 

netCDF data model, but backward compatibility is preserved. The netCDF enhanced data 

model is also known as the netCDF-4 data model. 

The UML representation of the netCDF enhanced data model below highlights in red the 

additions to the netCDF classic data model, showing netCDF enhanced data model is 

conceptually a set of simple extensions to the classic netCDF data model.

follow.  Related conformance test cases are defined in Annex A of OGC 10-090r3, 

“NetCDF Core.”    

7.1.2 Data types  

Req 3 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/req/netcdf-enhanced/data-types 

Variables and attributes shall have one of 12 primitive data types or one of four user-

defined data types 

Req 4 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/req/netcdf-enhanced/primitive-
data-types 

A primitive data type shall be one of char, byte, short, int, int64, float, double, unsigned 

byte, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned int64, string. 

Note: This extends the corresponding netCDF core requirement which only allows the 

char, byte, short, int, float, and double primitive data types. 

Req 5 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/req/netcdf-enhanced/user-
defined-data-types 

A user-defined data type shall be one of enumerated, opaque, compound, variableLength.  

7.1.3 Top-level, unnamed group 

Req 6 http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/req/netcdf-enhanced/top-level-
group 

A netCDF dataset shall have one top level, unnamed group. In this context an unnamed 

group is equivalent to a group whose name is the null string. 

Note: The top-level unnamed group provides backward compatibility with netCDF 

classic files, which have no groups. Thus, a netCDF classic file can be thought of as a 

netCDF enhanced model file with only the top-level unnamed group. 

7.1.4 Groups 

Each group may contain zero or more named subgroups, user-defined types, variables, 

dimensions, and attributes. 

7.1.5 Variables 

Variables may have attributes.  

7.1.6 Dimensions 

One or more dimensions may be of unlimited length.

http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/conf/netcdf-enhanced/classic-data-model 

[Dependencies: netCDF classic abstract model as specified in the document OGC 10-090, 

“NetCDF Core.”   Annex A of OGC 10-090, “NetCDF Core.” ]  

Open the dataset and verify that data conform to the netCDF classic abstract model as 

specified in the document OGC 10-090, “NetCDF Core” with the extensions specified in 

the following conformance tests.  Related conformance test cases are defined in Annex A 

of OGC 10-090, “NetCDF Core.”   

A.1.3 Conformance Test 3: http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/conf/netcdf-
enhanced/data-types 

Open the dataset and verify that variables and attributes have one of 12 primitive data 

types or one of four user-defined data types 

A.1.4 Conformance Test 4: http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/conf/netcdf-
enhanced/primitive-data-types 

Open the dataset and verify that primitive data type are one of char, byte, short, int, int64, 

float, double, unsigned byte, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned int64, string. 

Note: This extends the corresponding netCDF core conformance test which only allows 

the char, byte, short, int, float, and double primitive data types. 

A.1.5 Conformance Test 5: http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/conf/netcdf-
enhanced/user-defined-data-types 

Open the dataset and verify that each user-defined data types is one of enumerated, 

opaque, compound, variableLength.

A.1.6 Conformance Test 6: http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/conf/netcdf-
enhanced/top-level-group 

Open the dataset and determine that it has one top level, unnamed group.  In this context 

an unnamed group is equivalent to a group whose name is the null string. 

A.1.7 Conformance Test 7: http://www.opengis.net/spec/netcdf-enhanced/1.0/conf/netcdf-
enhanced/shared-dimensions 

Open the dataset and verify that each shared dimension indicates a common grid.
