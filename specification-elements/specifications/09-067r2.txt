OWS-6 Testbed 

 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 

collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver Engineering 

Reports and Change Requests into the OGC Specification Program, where they are 

formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of 

technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing interoperability problems 

posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include 

test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - 

all designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC 

standards. 

 

In April 2008, the OGC issued a call for sponsors for an OGC Web Services, Phase 6 (OWS-

6) Testbed activity. The activity completed in June 2009. There is a series of on-line 

demonstrations available here: http://www.opengeospatial.org/pub/www/ows6/index.html  

The OWS-6 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 

requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 

recommended to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-6 initiative be organized around 

the following threads:  

 

1. Sensor Web Enablement (SWE)  

 

2. Geo Processing Workflow (GPW)  

 

3. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM)  

 

4. Decision Support Services (DSS)  

 

5. Compliance Testing (CITE)

4 Overview 

The Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing Service proposed in the OWS-6 DSS thread is a 

service based on data encoded as CityGML and provided by an OGC WMS interface. 

There are three featured functions. 

1) Network topology for CityGML 

Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing Service is designed to provide navigation information 

that lets users easily find out how to get to their chosen destination. CityGML is the 

accepted standard for describing 3D data sets for city environments, including buildings. 

But CityGML does not currently include a data model for routing information. By adding 

the network topology, path routing can be performed seamlessly and efficiently between 

the outdoor and indoor environments. So in this DSS thread, we have developed the route 

calculation as well as the indoor network topology. 

2) WMS interface 

To obtain information for Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing service, the WMS interface 

can be used. We think these services will be applicable to a lot of devices. Specifically, 

cellular phones are our main target as well as PCs. Because 3D viewing is too heavy for 

cellular phones, we decided to provide the information with 2D images. To display some 

additional navigation symbols, we add some parameters to the WMS/GetMap operation. 

3) CityGML dataset for demo scenario 

We have developed and evaluated the test-bed program and its experimental environment 

at the Hitachi Central Research Laboratory (CRL) in Tokyo Japan. So we have made the 

CityGML datasets of the Hitachi CRL building, which we share in the demo scenario. 

This data has the walls and the opening doors so that anyone can walk through our 

building. 

Figure 1 gives an overview.

5 Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing Services 

5.1 Introduction 

Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing Service is designed to provide navigation information 

that lets users easily find out how to get to wherever they want to go. For Outdoor and 

Indoor 3D Routing Services, the Indoor Spatial Data Modeling is the most important 

component. Any lines, polygons, and their relation should be stated for expressing 

locations and areas inside a building and/or underground. 

CityGML is the accepted standard for describing 3D data sets for city environments, 

including buildings. But CityGML does not currently include a data model for routing 

information. By adding the network topology, efficient path routing between the outdoor 

and indoor environments can be seamlessly performed. So in this DSS thread, the 

concept of the network topology is embraced for CityGML.  

5.2 Network topology model for Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing Services 

Some types of network topology model are thought to enhance CityGML. The following 

four types of network topology model were considered for use in Outdoor and Indoor 3D 

Routing Services. 

5.2.1 Model 1: Network topology identical to the outdoor road network 

This model is almost identical to that of the outdoor road network. The points on the 

crossing are defined as nodes, and the lines between nodes as links. This model is applied 

to the indoor map in Figure 2. 



OGC 09-067r2 

Copyright © 2008-2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 5 
 

The issue is how to figure out where should be defined as nodes. For example, in Figure 

2, the three nodes were defined in the center corridor, because it is adjoined to the room 

to the right by two doors and also adjoined to elevators by one door. But this process is 

difficult to execute automatically. Furthermore, this network topology uses a polyline to 

show the route, but people will often move freely around a room instead of walking along 

the polyline as shown. This model’s best feature is that it can be developed in the same 

way as the outdoor road network model, so the cost reduction can be estimated in 

practical use.

Point = Node

Line segment= link

Figure 2: Network model 1. 

5.2.2 Model 2: Network topology focused on the center points of each room 

This model is focused on the center point of each room. The center points of all rooms 

and the points where the rooms are adjoined are defined as nodes. The lines between 

nodes are defined as links. This model is applied to the indoor map in Figure 3. 

EV

Point = Node

Figure 3: Network model 2. 

The best feature is that if the geometries of the building are already stored in the GIS 

middlewares, almost all nodes and links can be defined automatically. But in the case of a 



OGC 09-067r2 

6 Copyright © 2008-2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 
 

big room, such as an exhibition hall, the issue is that a route that charts a path through the 

center of the room looks unnatural to users. Additionally, all the center points of each 

room and all the points where the rooms are adjoined must be managed, so there is a 

problem from the point of view of scalability. 

5.2.3 Model 3: Network topology expanded from Model 2 

This model is expanded from model 2. The room is divided into areas called “cells”. The 

center points of each cell and the points where the cells are adjoined are defined as nodes. 

The lines between nodes are defined as links. This model is applied to the indoor map in 

Figure 4. 

This model of course has the same merits as model 2. In addition, the route line looks 

better than that of model 2, because in the case of a big room, it is divided into some 

smaller cells and the provided route polylines look similar to the user’s real walking path 

route. The issue is that the numbers of nodes and links to be managed will increase much 

more than those of model 2. This is also a serious problem from the point of view of 

scalability.

Figure 4: Network model 3. 

5.2.4 Model 4: Network topology based on polygons 

This model is based on the concept of the transition between the rooms. In general, nodes 

are related to points, and links are related to polylines. On the other hand, the concept of 

the nodes and links in this model is thought to be independent of the geometries. The 

polygons expressing the rooms are related to nodes, and the points at which the rooms are 

adjoined are related to links. The navigation symbols do not show the direction of the 

route but show the doors or the junctions to which the users should go next. This model is 

applied to the indoor map in Figure 5. 



OGC 09-067r2 

Copyright © 2008-2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 7 
 

This model does not bother with how users move around inside the room but is 

concerned with in which room users are located, which room is next, and through which 

door users should go next. This model is easy for users to understand, and the numbers of 

nodes and links are fewer than those of model 3. The issue is the cost for implementation 

on the legacy GIS middlewares.

Polygon = Node

Point= link

Figure 5: Network model 4. 

5.2.5 Conclusion 

Table 1 shows the result of comparison between the four models. 

Table 1: Comparison between the four models. 

Req. \ Model 1 2 3 4 

Cost of preparing network topology Bad Good Good Good 

Efficiency for searching and managing Good Normal Bad Good 

Ability of trajectory analysis for users Normal Bad Good Normal 

Usability of navigation information Normal Bad Normal Normal 

Cost of development Normal Good Good Bad 

 

According to this comparison, models 3 and 4 seem to have advantages over the others. 

Model 3 is easier on the legacy GIS middlewares to implement, so we adopted model 3 in 

this OWS-6 project. 

5.3 Interface Specification 

The Outdoor and Indoor 3D Routing Service interface supports two operations: 

1. GetCapabilities 

2. GetMap

6 CityGML data sets 

In DSS, the geographic content is provided and stored as CityGML data sets. 

 Background 
The building model described in above chapters is based on the OpenGIS CityGML 

Encoding Standard (OGC 08-007r1). 

The main purpose of this building model is to provide a geometric description of a 

building and its interior structures for other applications, e.g. indoor navigation. 

Therefore we generated this building model complying with the baseline of CityGML 

specifications while the most of non-geometric related information and features are 

intended to be vacant for further modifications by other applications. This information 

includes “creationDate”, “function” of building, “id” of building etc.  

Since the interior of a building can only be represented in the Level of Details 4 (LOD4), 

which is the highest level of resolution of the building model, this building model is 

generated as a LOD4 CityGML building model. 

 Data Source 
The raw data source of this building model is a set of 2D building plans in ESRI shape 

format, which are converted from a CAD data set, as shown in Figure 9.

respectively. Rooms are closed black polygons, and doors are light blue rectangles.  

 



OGC 09-067r2 

14 Copyright © 2008-2009 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 
 

The plans contain only two types of building parts, rooms and doors. A room is 

represented as a closed polygon, and a door as a small rectangle. Data of room and door 

are independent, and there is no link between them. The 2D coordinates of data are in 

Tokyo Datum coordinate system [1]. Unfortunately, the actual floor height is unavailable 

and we simply define a value (5 meters in this case) as the floor height in our building 

model.   

 Building Structure 
The building is a complex structure, as shown in Figure 9. There are three building parts 

in the plan of first floor (A). Part I is the main building with two wings and both of them 

are four-floor structures. Part II is a one-floor reception room. Part III is a five-floor 

building part. Part IV in floor plan (B) indicates two floors (the fifth and sixth) above Part 

I of the main building.  

 LOD4 3D Building Model 
A building could be represented as an aggregation of building parts in accordance with 

arbitrary, user-defined criteria. On the basis of the data source available, we represent our 

building as the aggregation of roofs, floors, walls, and doors. 

 Roofs and floors are represented as the horizontal planes that cover and separate 
floors. They are defined by using bldg:lod4MultiSurface. 

 Walls are represented as the vertical planes that separate rooms, and are defined 
by using bldg:lod4MultiSurface. To allow passage through, the polygons of 

doors are caved into walls to make holes in walls. 

 Doors and windows are represented as the class openings on walls and are 
defined by using bldg:lod4MultiSurface. Because doors and windows are not 

explicitly associated with walls in our data set, a dummy wall is created as a 

container to include all doors and windows. 

 Visualization of 3D Building Model 
Our 3D CityGML building model has been smoothly imported into Autodesk 

LandXplorer©[2] and Aristoteles CityGML viewer[3], and the screen snaps of 

visualization are shown in Figures10 to 13. 

 Summary 
A 3D CityGML building model in LOD4 is generated on the basis of a set of 2D building 

plans and is able to provide a reasonably good 3D interior building model for 

visualization and navigation applications.

 To support network topology for CityGML 
To manage indoor spatial data, there are some requirements from the application point of 

view. CityGML network topology capability is especially essential for indoor 

environment applications such as indoor/outdoor seamless routing, emergency evacuation, 

and autonomous mobile robots. 

As we mentioned in this ER, network topology for indoor environment should be 

different from that for outdoors. According to comparisons between the four models 

proposed in clause 5.2, models 3 and 4 seem to have some advantages over the others. As 

the current version of CityGML does not support network topology, our network 

topology is represented by our original manner in this OWS-6 project. We suggest that 

the next version of CityGML should support network topology for indoor environment 

applications. 

 Distribution of network topology for Indoor routing 
In this OWS-6 project, our system can be accessed by WMS interface, and we did not 

prepare the interface for distributing network topology. We extended WMS interface so 

that it can distribute the route information and the navigation information such as “arrow 

image” at the crossings on the indoor map. To handle the distribution of network 

topology, we suggest the following: 

 Support WFS for CityGML LOD4 and/or 

 OpenLS compatible 

 Location reference system for connecting different coordinate systems 
To seamlessly provide spatial service both in outdoor and indoor environments, the 

“connecting point (place)” between outdoor and indoor is important. Basically, the 

outdoor information provider and the indoor information provider are different, and the 

“connecting point” is managed in different location reference systems. So to define some 

specific place seamlessly, we should share some location reference systems. In Japan, 

mainly two reference system specifications are now being proposed: Place Identifier [5] 

is promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and ucode[6] is promoted 

by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. 

On the other hand, in the ITS field there are also specifications of a connecting point 

among different transportation systems such as cars, trains, buses, planes, and so on. 

ISO/TC 204 WG8 is now discussing Identification of Fixed Objects in Public Transport 

(IFOPT) [4] to solve this issue. 

Therefore, to share CityGML data both in outdoor and indoor environments seamlessly 

and regardless of domains, we need some location reference systems compatible with 

CityGML.
