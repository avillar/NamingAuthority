Preface 

An assessment of the maturity of implementations of OGC Sensor Web Enablement 
(SWE) standards is documented in this OGC Engineering Report (ER).   The assessment 
was conducted using the OGC Request for Information (RFI) process.  The RFI was 
supported by Envitia under contract by Defense Science and Technology Laboratory 
(DSTL), Advanced Geospatial information and Intelligence Services (AGIS) research 
program within Ministry of Defense (MoD). 

Successful implementations of SWE were identified in order to provide the UK Ministry 
of Defense (MoD) with a “state of the practice” and benefits of using SWE. While all 
implementations of SWE were of interest, of particular interest to the RFI were 
operational implementations of SWE in the defense and space community, with direct 
interest in Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR).   

Beginning in 2001, there have been numerous implementations based on the SWE 
standards.  Based on the contents of this Engineering Report, the current status of the 
maturity of SWE implementation can be summarized as: 

 SWE Version 1 standards are mature specifications with approved OGC 
compliance test suites and implementations. There are tens of independent 
implementations of the standards that have been deployed in operational systems.  
SWE version 1 is at Technology Readiness Level 9 – the highest level – and can 
confidently be mandated in system procurements. 

 SWE Version 2 standards are in-process to be approved in the first half of this 
year (2013).  Building upon Version 1, the Version 2 specs have improved 
designs and additional functionality.  Independent implementations have been 
developed and tested.  Compliance tests are being finalized.  SWE Version 2 is at 
Technology Readiness level 6 and has emerged for consideration in systems 
currently under development. 

 Enhancements and coordination of the SWE standards are in a variety of states.  
In the OGC Interoperability Program initiatives, SWE has been used as a basis for 
a variety of topics:  Workflows including SWE; Secure Sensor Web; Events and 
SWE; JPIP Streaming; Full Motion Video; Moving Object Indicators; GPS 
ephemeris/data, and more. 

The SWE framework provides significant benefits for supporting the integration and 
fusion of a wide variety of assets, and readily enables a system that is able to sense and 
react to threats or opportunities. Very capable software components exist for supporting 
development of SWE implementations.

3.1 Actuator 
A type of transducer that converts a signal to some real-world action or phenomenon.  

3.2 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) 
A spatial or temporal framework within which a position and/or time can be defined. 
According to ISO 19111, a coordinate system that is related to the real world by a 
datum. 

3.3 Feature 
Abstraction of real-world phenomena [ISO 19101:2002, definition 4.11] 

Note: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance should be 
used when only one is meant. 

3.4 Location 
A point or extent in space relative to a coordinate system. For point-based systems, this 
is typical expressed as a set of n-dimensional coordinates within the coordinate system. 
For bodies, this is typically expressed by relating the translation of the origin of an 
object’s local coordinate system with respect to the origin of an external reference 
coordinate system. 

3.5 Measurand 
Physical parameter or a characteristic of a phenomenon subject to a measurement, 
whose value is described using a Measure (ISO 19103). Subset of determinand or 
observable. [O&M] 

3.6 Measure (noun) 
Value described using a numeric amount with a scale or using a scalar reference system  
[ISO/TS 19103]. When used as a noun, measure is a synonym for physical quantity  

3.7 Measurement  
An observation whose result is a measure  

3.8 Observable, Observable Property 
A parameter or a characteristic of a phenomenon subject to observation.  Synonym for 
determinand. [O&M] 
 
A property of a phenomenon that can be observed and measured (e.g. temperature, 
gravitational force, position, chemical concentration, orientation, number-of-individuals, 
physical switch status, etc.), or a characteristic of one or more feature types, the value for 
which must be estimated by application of some procedure in an observation. It is thus a 
physical stimulus that can be sensed by a detector or created by an actuator.

3.9 Observation  
Act of observing a property or phenomenon (ISO/DIS 19156, definition 4.10) 
 

Note: The goal of an observation may be to measure, estimate or otherwise determine the 
value of a property. 
 
3.10 Position 
The location and orientation of an object relative to an external coordinate system. For 
body-based systems (in lieu of point-based systems) is typically expressed by relating the 
object’s local coordinate system to an external reference coordinate system. This 
definition is in contrast to some definitions (e.g. ISO 19107) which equate position to 
location.  

3.11 Sensor 
An entity capable of observing a phenomenon and returning an observed value. Type of 
observation procedure that provides the estimated value of an observed property at its output. 

Note: A sensor uses a combination of physical, chemical or biological means in order to estimate 
the underlying observed property. At the end of the measuring chain electronic devices often 
produce signals to be processed. 

3.12 Sensor Model 
In line with traditional definitions of the remote sensing community, a sensor model is a 
type of Location Model that allows one to georegister or co-register observations from a 
sensor (particularly remote sensors). The sensor model characterizes the sensor 
sufficiently to allow registration of observations with a defined accuracy. 

3.13 Transducer 
An entity that receives a signal as input and generates a modified signal as output. 
Includes detectors, actuators, and filters.

5 Process to assess SWE Implementation Maturity  

5.1 RFI process 

A Request for Information (RFI) was announced on 16 March 2013.  The RFI was 
announced to multiple OGC mailing lists with a total of 1225 distinct addresses. 

 OGC Conducted the RFI to support GEOCORE led by Envitia under contract by 
Defense Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), Advanced Geospatial 
information and Intelligence Services (AGIS) research program within Ministry 
of Defense (MoD) 

 OGC was seeking information about maturity of Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) 
Standards.  

 This RFI seeks asked for information about successful implementations of SWE 
to provide the UK Ministry of Defense (MoD) with a “state of the practice” and 
benefits of using SWE.  

 While all implementations of SWE were of interest, of particular interest to the 
RFI were operational implementations of SWE in the defense and space 
community, with direct interest in Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, 
and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) – See Figure 1.  
 

Information received by OGC was used in a webinar and Engineering Report (ER) for 
MoD stakeholders 

 Emphasis was on the maturity and benefits of SWE implementations.  
 This OGC Engineering Report was prepared to summarize the implementations, 

identifying the benefits, the most appropriate standards, and where research is 
needed and could be exploited. 
 

Responses to the RFI were due by 29 March 2013.

5.3 Stakeholders Webinar 

To convey the status of SWE implementations to the MoD Stakeholders, OGC conducted 
a webinar on 16 April 2013.  The agenda and content for the webinar (Table 1) was 
developed based on the responses to the RFI and additional information identified by 
OGC staff.  For example, the recent GEOSS Future Products Workshop4 provided 
relevant information and presentations. 

The stakeholders were represented in the webinar by individuals from these 
organizations:

6 OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) Standards 

6.1 SWE Overview 

The SWE standards framework is to sensor resources what the WWW is to general 
information sources—an infrastructure allowing users to easily share their sensor 
resources in a well-defined way. It hides the underlying layers, the network 
communication details, and heterogeneous sensor hardware from the applications built on 
top of it. As the number of sensors in our world increases exponentially, this 
infrastructure for innovation will affect everyone's lives, though most people won't know 
any more about SWE standards than they know about TCP/IP and XML. 

The SWE5 initiative standardizes web service interfaces and data encodings that can be 
used as building blocks for a Sensor Web.  Since 2001, the OGC has been engaged in 
developing a set of standards for web-enabling sensors and sensor observations. Versions 
1.0 of the SWE standards were approved and released in 2007. Versions 2.0 of these 
standards have either been approved, or will be approved by Spring 2013.   

Due to the large number of sensor manufacturers and differing accompanying protocols, 
integrating diverse sensors into observation systems is not straightforward. A coherent 
infrastructure is needed to treat sensors in an interoperable, platform-independent and 
uniform way. The concept of the Sensor Web reflects such a kind of infrastructure for 
sharing, finding, and accessing sensors and their data across different applications. A 
Sensor Web hides the heterogeneous sensor hardware and communication protocols from 
the applications built on top of it. 

A sensor network is a computer accessible network of many spatially distributed devices 
using sensors to monitor conditions at different locations, such as temperature, sound, 
vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants. A Sensor Web refers to Web accessible sensor 
networks and archived sensor data that can be discovered and accessed using standard 
protocols and service interfaces.

Figure 2. Sensor Web Enablement Framework (Source: M. Botts) 

 

The members of the OGC have collaborated to define and document a unique and 
revolutionary framework of open standards for exploiting Web-connected sensors and 
sensor systems of all types: flood gauges, air pollution monitors, stress gauges on bridges, 
mobile heart monitors, Webcams, airborne and satellite-borne earth imaging devices and 
countless other sensors and sensor systems. A driving requirement for this work is to ease 
the ability to integrate diverse sensors into an integrated system. Due to the large variety 
of sensor protocols and sensor interfaces, prior to the availability of SWE, most 
application developers were integrating sensor resources through proprietary mechanisms 
instead of building upon a well-defined and established integration layer. This manual 
bridging between sensor resources and applications leads to extensive adaption effort, 
and is a key cost factor in large-scale deployment scenarios.

6.2 SWE Standards 

The SWE standards baseline offers the following functionalities: 

 Description of sensor data to enable further processing. 
 Description of sensor metadata including properties and behavior of sensors, as 

well as correlating reliability and accuracy of collected measurements.  
 Discovery of and access to observations and sensor metadata based on 

standardized data formats and appropriate query and filter mechanisms. 
 Tasking of sensors for the acquisition of measurement data. 

The suite of standards currently comprising SWE includes XML encodings and web 
service interfaces. These standards support discovery of sensors, observations, and 
processes surrounding measurement, as well as the tasking of assets, access to 
observations and observation streams, publication and subscription of sensor alerts, and 
on-demand processing of sensor observations. The standards include:

SWE Encodings: 
 SWE Common – common data models and schema used by all SWE standards 
 SensorML – models and schema for describing sensor and actuator systems and 

processes surrounding measurement and the tasking of assets 
 Observations and Measurements (O&M) – models and schema for packaging 

observations 

SWE Services: 
 Sensor Observation Service (SOS) – standard web interface for accessing 

observations and subscribing to alerts 
 Sensor Planning Service (SPS) – standard web interface for tasking sensor 

system, models, and actuators 
 SWE Service Model - defines eight packages with data types for common use 

across OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) services. 
 PUCK - Defines a protocol to retrieve a SensorML description, sensor "driver" 

code, and other information from the device itself, thus enabling automatic sensor 
installation, configuration and operation. 

In the course of SWE development, OGC has addressed the need for event handling.  The 
Sensor Alert Service and Web Notification service were developed as part of the SWE 
version 1 developments and both were released as OGC Best Practices.  An event 
architecture, event notification service and sensor event service have been defined and in 
tested in both SWE threads and Aviation threads of in OWS-6 and OWS-7 Testbeds.  An 
outcome is that the SWE Service Model, version 2.0, OGC document 09-001, includes 
Event handling that can be applied to the SWE services.  

All of these standards are encoding and interface specifications for use by software 
developers. The standards are developed in an open process within the OGC governed by 
established policies and procedures. Many of the vendors and users who collaboratively 
develop them are influential industry "market makers." They have a stake in the SWE 
standards' widespread implementation and deployment, and thus the standards become 
"industry standards". 

6.3 OGC Sensor Web for IoT 

The Internet of Things (IoT) is “a dynamic global network infrastructure with self 
configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocols 
where physical and virtual ‘things’ have identities, physical attributes, and virtual 
personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the 
information network”7. The Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) latest developments 
aim to achieve the vision of an Open IoT.   Interoperability of IoT devices based on open 
standards will be required to meet the vision of IoT.  Based on a series of workshops,

OGC members chartered development of a Sensor Web for IoT standard.  OGC’s existing 
standards for location information and sensor observations are the basis for this work.  
OGC’s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) provides a rich basis for this new development. 
Two implementations from OGC members – TinySOS and SenseBox – provide 
implementation experience for this new standard.  The OGC Sensor Web for IoT will 
enable many IoT applications based on sensors. 

The Internet of Things (IoT) has moved from concept to initial deployment and will grow 
to 50 billion internet-connected sensors and devices8.  IoT has the potential to change the 
world, just as the Internet and WWW did. A huge variety of day-to-day objects will 
become IoT enabled. A plethora of applications from personal interest to environmental 
monitoring will emerge by mix-and-match of different sensors, mobile devices, and 
cloud-based resources.  Heterogeneity of devices and applications demands 
interoperability.  Interoperability based on open standards will be a key factor for the 
success of IoT. The primary recommendation from OGC IoT workshops was to form a 
Standards Working Group (SWG).  The new Sensor Web for IoT SWG9 is to develop one 
or more standards based on existing protocols while leveraging the existing and proven 
OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) family of standards.  

The OGC SWE initiative10 developed open standards to enable an interoperable access to 
sensors. SWE uses XML and robust Web service standards. For realizing an Open IoT, 
lightweight profiles of the established SWE standards are needed.  Two examples 
motivate the OGC approach: 

 TinySOS implemented the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) directly on a 
class-1 IoT device (i.e., devices with about 10 Kbytes of RAM and 100 Kbytes of 
code space). This way, a TinySOS IoT device is not only self-describable but also 
inherits the comprehensive SWE model and interoperates with existing SWE 
applications. 

 A similar approach takes the SenseBox project. However, while TinySOS keeps 
the XML communication of SOS, the SenseBox defines a new RESTful interface 
that allows communication through the more lightweight JSON protocol. The 
SenseBox is a generic hardware and software framework that can be setup for 
different use cases. In previous work, it has been evaluated e.g. as an air quality 
measurement station or to count cars in a Smart City environment based on an 
attached ultrasonic sensor 

 
Building on SWE, TinySOS, SenseBox and other IoT protocols, the OGC Sensor Web for 
IoT SWG is developing a standard that makes observations captured by IoT devices easily

accessible. This functionality is defined as lightweight RESTful web interface using 
CRUD (i.e., create, read, update, and delete) functions on IoT resources. While nearly 
complete, SWE-IoT is ongoing and OGC invites others to join the process to define an 
easy-to-use interface for sensors to realize the Open IoT vision. 

6.4 Benefits of using SWE 

SWE is the only open international standards suite that provides a comprehensive 
platform for publishing, discovering, assessing, accessing and using sensors and sensor 
systems of all kinds, and the standards are open. The standards documents are freely 
available on the web. The consensus process in which SWE standards are created and 
maintained is open to all who want to participate, and the process guards against future 
intellectual property claims that would compromise the standards' openness. The 
encodings and interfaces are based on fundamental, widely used and open Internet and 
Web standards and best programming practices. Their use requires no proprietary 
platform support of any kind, and yet they can be implemented on platforms other than 
the open Internet and Web. Specifically, they can also be implemented in secure and 
closed networks. 
 

 Sensor system agnostic - Virtually any sensor, actuator, or modeling system can 
be supported 

 Net-centric, SOA-based 
– Distributed architecture allows independent development of services but 

enables on-the-fly connectivity between resources 
 Semantically tied 

– Relies on online dictionaries and ontologies for semantics 
– Key to interoperability 

 Traceability (using SensorML) 
– Observation lineage 
– Quality of measurement support 

 Implementation flexibility 
– Wrap existing capabilities and sensors 
– Implement services and processing where it makes sense (e.g. near 

sensors, closer to user, or in-between) 
– Scalable from single, simple sensor to large sensor collections 

Another unique feature of SWE standards is that they were developed by the principal 
international industry standards development organization focused on geospatial 
standards, and therefore sensor location information is an integral part of communications 
that use these standards. In most applications, sensor location is an important sensor 
attribute. 

SWE incorporates models for describing sensor resources and sensor observations. 
Further, it defines web service interfaces leveraging the models and encodings to allow 
accessing sensor data, tasking of sensors, and alerting based on gathered sensor 
observations. One of the unique aspects of SWE standards is that they are being used for 



OGC 13-032 

14 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

simple applications, such as logging temperatures, as well as highly complex applications 
such as scheduling the motions and other exposure parameters of satellite-mounted 
imaging systems. One recent study explored and demonstrated the potential for 
supporting ALL data files and data streams within the GPS delivery system using the 
OGC SWE Common Data standard and also the ability to describe GPS processing 
workflows using the OGC Sensor Model Language (SensorML) standard. 

The SWE specifications provide the functionality to integrate sensors into just about any 
application or architecture. The integration of sensor assets into Spatial Data 
Infrastructures makes it possible to couple available sensor data with other spatio-
temporal resources (e.g., maps, raster as well as vector data) at the application level, 
which maximizes the sensors' value and effectiveness for decision support. Due to this 
integration, Sensor Webs and the geosensors they comprise represent a real-time link of 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) into the physical world. 

The OGC has pioneered open service interface standards in the geospatial domain and the 
sensor domain, and the pioneering continues because both of these domains are dynamic, 
requiring agile and innovative standards development. OGC members' diversity of 
interests and commitment to innovation causes both the geospatial standards effort and 
the SWE effort to stay abreast of IT industry advances such as the Semantic Web, data 
provenance, RESTful web services, non-SQL databases, Big Data and applications with 
challenging transaction rates that may involve updates and alerts. The cross-fertilization 
between "geo" and SWE advances sensor integration state of the art as industry experts in 
the OGC membership track and innovate in emerging fields such as the Internet of 
Things, chaining of analytical model inputs and outputs, and the convergence of location, 
imaging and Point Of Interest data in Augmented Reality.

7 Implementations of SWE  

SWE presents many opportunities for adding a real-time sensor dimension to the Internet 
and the Web. SWE standards have been implemented in hundreds of applications (from 
mobile to enterprise) in domains including disaster management, remote sensing (UAVs, 
satellites), environmental monitoring, transportation management, defense, security, 
public safety, meteorology, hydrology, alerting, and building monitoring systems.

7.2 US Geospatial-Intelligence Working Group 

The Geospatial Intelligence Standards Working Group (GWG) serves as a U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), Federal, and Civil 
community-based forum to advocate for IT standards and standardization activities 
related to geospatial intelligence (GEOINT).  The GWG supports the GEOINT 
Functional Manager for GEOINT architecture and standards (NSG Directive FM100- 
Appendix K, 06 May 11).   

The GWG conducts a Standards governance process by which it manages and votes 
GEOINT Standards Lifecycle.  Approved standards are cited in US DoD Information 
Technology Standards Registry (DISR). Most of the SWE 1.0 standards are already cited 
in the DISR, with the GWG currently reviewing the SWE 2.0 standards for projected 
endorsement in 2013. Standards

7.3 US DoD Joint C2 Objective Architecture  

It is planned that the SWE 2.0 standards will be part of the US DoD Joint C2 Objective 
Architecture to be defined later this year.   Parallel actions are being worked for the ISR 
side.  This is consistent with the NATO Maritime ISR way forward.  This is to support 
both military and military support to civil operations functions in classified and non-
classified environments.  This move is driven by the great work of OGC members who 
have been working with SWE into SWE 2.0.

7.4 US NASA SensorWeb11 

The main objective of the NASA SensorWeb activity is to create an interoperable 
environment for a diverse set of Earth observing satellite sensors via the use of software 
and the Internet. This capability can be used to better understand physical phenomena, 
such as volcanic eruptions, fires and floods. Furthermore, it facilitates science 
investigation since it becomes much easier to enlist existing satellite, airborne and ground 
sensors for required observations and then to easily create custom data products that can 
be delivered via Web 2.0 tools. Popular tools such as Google Earth can be used to create 
mashups in which data sets are superimposed for purposes of visualization or calibration. 
The end goal is to make discovery and access to sensors as easy as finding and using 
websites on the Internet. Figure 5 shows the use of OGC SWE in the NASA SensorWeb. 

 

 

Figure 5. NASA SensorWeb High Level Architecture 

Among its many features, is the GeoBliki service that allows NASA to task the EO-1 
satellite through SWE-based interfaces. The service has been used in a variety of 
applications including for example the 2007 wild fires in California12.

7.5 US IOOS 

The US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is leading the 
development of an Integrated Oceans Observing System (IOOSIOOS).  Central to the 
success of IOOS is the presence of a Data Management and Communication (DMAC)13 
system capable of delivering real-time, delayed-mode, and historical data for in-situ and 
remotely-sensed physical, chemical and biological observations.  DMAC Recommended 
Web Services and Data Encodings, including SWE standards, are shown in Figure 6.  

 

Figure 6 NOAA DMAC IOOS Recommended Web Services and Data Encodings 

 

Regional U.S. IOOS provide increased observations, distinctive knowledge, and critical 
technological abilities, and apply these towards the development of products to meet 
regional and local needs. The Mid-Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observing System 
(MARACOOS) spans the coastal states from Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras.  MARACOOS 
implementation of OGC SWE standards using a variety of clients (Figure 7) was 
demonstrated during the SWE Maturity Stakeholders Webinar14.

7.6 ESA SPS satellite tasking 

The European Space Agency (ESA) has implemented the SPS standard for tasking of 
satellite assets as part of ESA Heterogeneous Missions Accessibility (HMA) project15.   

HMA is the result of more than five years of coordination and harmonization efforts, 
under the auspices of and with the cooperation of the ESA Ground Segment Coordination 
Body in the critical area of ground segment interoperability 

The ESA HMA Feasibility Analysis Service is an extension of the OGC Sensor Planning 
Service (SPS). The OGC SPS provides a standard interface to task any kind of sensor to 
retrieve collection assets (i.e. sensors and other information-gathering assets). 
Furthermore, a client can either determine collection feasibility for a desired set of 
collection requests for one or more sensors/platforms, or submit collection requests 
directly to these sensors/platforms. Different kinds of assets with differing capabilities as 
well as different kinds of request processing systems are supported.

Figure 8. ESA HMA Feasibility Analysis Service implementation of SWE 

The EO-SPS application profile is flexible enough to handle the variety of programming 
needs of most EO satellite systems. This means in particular the ability to support 
different configurations to access the different stages of planning, scheduling, tasking, 
collection, processing, archiving and distribution of requests, and the resulting 
observation data.  The work culminated in open source implementations of the EO SPS 
extension v2.0 OGC 10-135 (extending SPS v2.0 OGC 09-000), as detailed at:

The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is a constellation of three synthetic-
aperture radar imaging satellites. RCM is being developed for the Canadian Space 
Agency (CSA) by an industrial team led by MDA Systems Ltd. The mission will be 
providing distributed and concurrent access to the ordering system through both a web-
based interface and an electronic-based interface. The electronic-based interface will be 
implemented based on a set of HMA standards for ordering SAR data acquisitions and 
SAR data products, and for browsing an archive of raw SAR data. RCM is plans to 
support a set of OGC standards.16

7.7 European Sensor Web Infrastructure Management (SWIMA) Project  

The Sensor Web Infrastructure Management (SWIMA) Project17 was a two-year project 
that started in September 2008 and partially funded by the UK Technology Strategy 
Board. The main goal was to research how an open, standards-based sensor web 
approach can provide the necessary capabilities to improve data gathering in complex 
natural environments such as rivers and lakes.  

The full members of the consortium are: QinetiQ, the Environment Agency of England 
and Wales; South West Water; 1Spatial Group Limited; YSI Hydrodata Limited and the 
University of Nottingham’s Centre for Geospatial Science. 

The project’s focus was on the provision of an innovative standards-based “middleware” 
layer between disparate sensor (and communication) networks and the associated control, 
management and user information services. The system was tested in a real-world 
environment by deploying a number of sensors for field trials between November 2009 
and September 2010. 

The main aim of the SWIMA project was to investigate the practical issues associated 
with the development of a generic Sensor-Web-based control and information system 
based on the use of SWE standards.  

The main objectives were to:  
 Investigate whether the standards are fit for purpose, i.e. whether they provide a 

viable and cost-effective solution for environmental monitoring systems;  
 Investigate any interoperability issues relating to the different implementations of 

the specifications;  
 Investigate the practical issues associated with a deployment of SWE enabled 

systems in a real environmental monitoring scenario.  

The Project developed a web-based software testbed to provide a framework for the 
testing of the SWE Standards and for the management and control of the field-deployed 
sensors.  gives an overview of the overall architecture.

Figure 9.  Overview of the UK SWIMA Architecture using SWE 

 

In general, the SWE standards have been successfully used to implement the desired 
environmental monitoring system. The standards (and the associated software tools) are 
sufficiently mature to support operational systems although the standards are still 
evolving and the available software may not support all defined features of the standards, 
and may be “buggy”. Implementing a system at this time may therefore have to overcome 
specification inconsistencies and software shortcomings. An example area where the 
client needed bespoke code to cope with differences in implementation of the standards 
was in the date & time format used in observations from different nodes. 

The project concluded that use of SWE standards is gaining momentum internationally 
with operational systems being developed in the USA, Australia and Europe. The 
standards and software tools should therefore continue to improve and become easier to 
use.

7.8 European Research Projects implementing SWE 

7.8.1 SANY 

As a major Integrated Project in the Sixth Framework Programme of the European 
Commission, SANY (stands for "Sensors Anywhere”) extends the interoperability 
advances into the domain of environmental sensor networks and standards-based sensor 
web enablement to support decision-making.  OGC SWE standards were applied in 
SANY to three innovative risk management applications involving air pollution, marine 
risks and geohazards. These efforts yielded valuable reference implementations of sensor 
web services and geospatial processing Web services for decision support and data 
fusion. 

SANY was the work of the SANY consortium, a group composed of 16 partners from 
seven EU member states (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Poland, United 
Kingdom) and one associated state (Switzerland). 

The SANY book18 provides an excellent introduction to OGC's Sensor Web Enablement 
(SWE) standards, which enable developers to make all types of sensors, transducers and 
sensor data repositories discoverable, accessible and useable via the Web. The book 
discusses in detail the approach and results of SANY.

7.8.2 GITEWS Project  

The GITEWS project (http://www.gitews.de/), an operational tsunami early warning 
system for the Indian Ocean, was developed as a Sensor Web infrastructure. The system 
integrates terrestrial observation networks of seismology and geodesy with marine 
measuring sensors, satellite technologies and pre-calculated simulation scenarios.  

Tsunami detection for Indonesia is challenging since there is an extremely short time 
window between tsunami generation (in most cases caused by an earthquake along the 
Sunda Arc) and the arrival time at the nearest Indonesian coastline. Hence, the GITEWS 
project uses the best sensor technologies available today to detect indicators for a tsunami 
and combines those information with up-to-date modeling techniques. To make the 
sensor data ad-hoc available, the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework plays 
a key role in the sensor data management of the GITEWS system. Based on SWE 
standards, other OGC Web services components are applied (e.g., Web Map Service) to 
display the current situation or communicate generated simulations.  

The sensor systems utilized within GITEWS are the following:  
 A continuous GPS System (CGPS) describes the seafloor deformation/rupture in 

(near) real-time based on highly accurate GPS measurements at smart land 
stations.  

 A Deep Ocean Observation System (DOOS) collects and processes sensor 
information transmitted from Ocean Bottom Units (OBUs, located on the seafloor 
underneath buoys) and buoys equipped with tsunami-detecting instruments.  

 A Tide Gauge System (TGS) collects and processes measurements of a network 
of tide gauges in order to detect sea level anomalies.  

Provision of observation data and sensor metadata is realized by the 52°North SOS 
implementation of version 1.0. Observation data is encoded using the O&M standard 1.0. 
Features are encoded as Geography Markup Language (GML) and also served via SOS 
(GetFeatureOfInterest operation). The SensorML standard is used to encode metadata of 
sensors. For performance reasons, there are several SOS instances setup and serving the 
different data sets.  

Several of the SWE software components utilized within GITEWS are based on the open 
source SWE Implementation Suite from 52°North (developed in a subcontract 
commissioned by the GITEWS partner DLR).

project (http://www.soknos.de/) was led by SAP and developed concepts to support 
governmental agencies, private companies, and other organizations in handling disastrous 
events. The SWE Implementation Suite from 52°North was used to integrate live sensor 
data into the situation map of a disaster management organization. Additionally, a 
concept for tasking mobile sensors and optimizing their coverage based on interpolation 
errors was developed (see figure below). A mobile sensor network was used to monitor 
air pollutants. The sensor nodes were provided by Scatterweb.

7.8.4 European Environment Agency SOS Project  

European Environment Agency (EEA) receives environmental data (e.g., air quality, 
noise, or biodiversity) from different organizations of its 32 member states. 
Heterogeneous data formats and data transfer mechanisms make the data collection and 
integration a difficult task for the EEA. Hence, SWE technology has been introduced to 
facilitate the interoperable exchange of environmental data on a large scale.  

As shown in the figure below, the data providing member state agencies are now in the 
process of changing to the standardized interface of the SOS to offer the data in the future 
to the EEA. On the side of the EEA, the member state data is collected, aggregated, and 
again offered via SOS interface. The data is encoded in O&M and metadata is given as

SensorML. The utilized SOS implementation from 52°North is based on ESRI’s ArcGIS 
Server.

7.8.5 The OSIRIS Project  

The OSIRIS project (http://www.osiris-fp6.eu/) has utilized SWE in multiple use cases:  
 forest fire fighting  
 air pollution monitoring and handling of accidents causing the release of air 

pollutants  
 water quality monitoring as well as coordination in case of hydrocarbon 

pollutions of drinking water  
 fire detection in industrial buildings  

In all of these scenarios a broad range of sensors needs to be deployed. These sensor 
systems range from meteorological sensors, pollution sensors (i.e. air and water 
pollutants) to very complex systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) taking 
aerial probes and images for situational awareness. As all of these sensor systems rely on 
their own protocols and interfaces their integration into a common decision support 
platform for risk monitoring and emergency management becomes a challenging task. 
Thus, to overcome this issue, the OGC Sensor Web Enablement framework was chosen 
by the OSIRIS project. Besides contributing to the advancement of the OGC SWE 
standards, the OSIRIS project has utilized the 52°North SWE Implementation Suite 
consisting of SOS, SPS, SAS/SES, and SIR to implement four different use cases.

7.8.6 Sensor Web for the German Federal Waterways Administration  

Together with the Service Centre Information Technology of the German Federal 
Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development at the Federal Waterways 
Engineering and Research Institute (DLZ-IT) and the Wupperverband, 52°North has 
conducted a project applying Sensor Web technology to hydrology.  

Both, the Wupperverband and the DLZ-IT are dealing in their daily business with a broad 
range of sensor data. However, the structure of these sensor networks is very 
heterogeneous which makes their integration into the internal spatial data infrastructures 
and application systems a cumbersome task. To overcome the difficulties created by this 
heterogeneity the decision was taken to use Sensor Web technology. Especially the 
following two use cases had to be solved:  

 Access to sensor data (i.e. time series data) and visualization of these data  
 Dispatching of notifications (via e-mail or SMS) if certain user-defined 

measurement value combinations occur  

For providing access to water level measurements, the 52°North Sensor Observation 
Service is coupled to the existing PEGELONLINE infrastructure of DLZ-IT. 
Furthermore, an additional generalization module speeds up the delivery of sensor data 
by reducing the amount of transmitted data.  

The filtering of incoming sensor data streams in order to notify subscribers in case of 
critical measurements is achieved through the 52°North Sensor Event Service.  

A Google Web Toolkit based web client application is available to display the water level 
data as diagrams and tables. Also a map view showing the sensor locations is included. 
Finally, the client allows users to flexibly define filter criteria describing measurement 
value constellations in which they would like to be notified.  
The project can be characterized through the following key facts:  

 Sensor Observation Service offering access to more than measurement stations 
(measuring multiple properties ranging from water level, conductivity to 
meteorological parameters)  

 Update rates: one update every minute to one update every 15 minutes  
 Client for time displaying series data (diagram and map views)  
 Notification component for near-real time filtering of measurements (SMS and e-

mail)  
 Deployment of OGC Sensor Web components in order to ensure interoperability

8 Software Implementations 

8.1 Certified and Registered Implementations 

OGC maintains a registry20 of publicly available implementations of the OGC Standards.  
The registry includes both 1) OGC Compliant implementations and 2) self-registered 
implementations.   There is no requirement to register with OGC and many products that 
implement OGC standards are not registered.  Vendors who have had their products 
passed the OGC compliance tests and who have obtained an OGC Trademark License 
may advertise their products as "OGC Compliant".   

Table 3 provides summary statistics for the SWE standards implementations registered in 
the registry.  The “n.a.” indicates that compliance certification is not yet possible as the 
compliance test suite has not yet been deployed for that standard.

8.2 The 52°North SWE Implementation Suite  

In response to the RFI, 52°North provided information about their implementation suite.  
52°North has implemented all OGC SWE services (server as well as client 
implementations) as open source software.  The 52°North suite has been used and 
customized in various projects by a variety of international clients (e.g., European 
Environment Agency (EEA), German Aerospace Agency, German Federal Waterways 
Administration, Rijkswaterstaat (part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the 
Environment), Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ), Global Runoff 
DataCentra (GRDC)).  

All relevant information on the 52°North SWE implementation projects can be found on 
the official website (http://52north.org/swe). Here, design descriptions, installation 
instructions, or code repositories are linked.

9 OGC Interoperability Program Implementations 

9.1 SWE in OGC IP Initiatives  

Development of the SWE suite of standards has been advanced by activities in the OGC 
Interoperability Program.  SWE has been implemented in nearly every OGC Web 
Services (OWS) Testbed.  OGC the (UAH) 

SWE was part of the first OWS testbed beginning in 2001.  Through a series of OWS-
1.1, OWS-1.2, OWS-3 and OWS-4 testbeds, the specifications were refined, 
implemented and demonstrated.  Extensive development by OGC members in OWS and 
outside of OWS initiatives culminated initiatives culminated in the adoption of SWE 
version 1.0 standards in 2007.  (Figure 17) 

  

 
Figure 17. OWS Testbeds support of SWE Version 1. (Source: M. Botts) 

Implementation of SWE continued after 2007 based on the version 1 standards.  The 
OGC IP Initiatives contributed to the refinement of the SWE standards eventually leading 
to version 2 and also contributed to the uptake of SWE into operational programs Figure 
18).  Experience gained in the OGC Empire Challenge Pilot contributed to development 
of the DoD/IC SensorWeb (See section 7.1).  Experience gained from two phases of the 
OGC Ocean Science Interoperability experiments contributed to development of the 
NOAA IOOS DMAC (See section 7.5).  Experience gained in the OWS-5 Testbed 
contributed to development of the NASA EO-1 SensorWeb (See section 7.4).

9.2 OWS-4 Testbed (2006) 

The OWS-4 Testbed21 contributed to the maturing implementation and testing of SWE 
components to support the adoption of SWE at the level of Version 1.0.  

In OWS-4 the Sensor Web subtask focused on maturing the existing set of SWE work 
items to enable the federation of sensors, platforms and management infrastructure into a 
single sensor enterprise.  This enterprise was envisioned to enable the discovery and 
tasking of sensors as well as the delivery of sensor measurements regardless of sensor 
type and controlling organization.  The ultimate vision was of a sensor market place 
where users can identify, evaluate, select and request a sensor collection regardless of 
sensor type, platform or owner. 

An objective in this testbed was to illustrate discovery, access to and fusing of disparate 
sensors (Figure 19).   The figure shows the Space Time Toolkit client accessing 
observations from several distributed services using OGC service interfaces: 

 SOS – in-situ radiation sensors  
 SOS – Doppler Radar 
 SOS – Lagrangian plume model

9.3 OWS-5 Testbed (2008) 

The OWS-5 Testbed24 focused on integrating the SWE interfaces and encodings into 
workflows to demonstrate the ability of SWE specifications to support operational needs. 

Emphasis for SWE during OWS-5 was on:

9.4 Empire Challenge (2008) 

The EC08 OGC Pilot examined the suitability and performance of SWE and OGC Web 
Service standards for providing open management of and access to sensors of varied 
types and Web service access by analysts to the resulting data and products. Several use 
cases and supporting workflows were provided to enable understanding of the design of 
the pilot. The use cases involved both sensor management and exploitation by a targeting 
analyst. Building upon a SensorWeb service oriented architecture that was demonstrated 
in EC 07, the goal in ’08 was to put new services and sensors into the defense-themed 
SensorWeb.  (See Section 7.1 for more about SensorWeb). 

OGC members participated in an OGC pilot activity in the Empire Challenge event in 
2008.  The OGC members demonstrated on-demand geolocation and display of HD video 
from Tigershark UAV.  As part of this pilot the Space Time Toolkit client was used to 
access a set of services using OGC interfaces: 

  SOS – Tigershark video and navigation  
  SOS – Troop Movement 
  SensorML – On-demand processing

9.5 Oceans Science IE (2007/2009) 

The Oceans Science Interoperability Experiments consolidated a portion of the Ocean-
Observing community on its understanding of various OGC specifications, solidified 
demonstrations for Ocean Science application areas, harden software implementations, 
and produce a candidate OGC Best Practices document that can be used to inform the 
broader ocean-observing community.  

In 2007, the Oceans IE phase 1 investigated use of OGC Web Feature Services (WFS) 
and SOS for representing and exchanging point data records from fixed in-situ marine 
platforms. The following topics for using SOS v1.1 were developed helping to improve 
existing standards and recommendations at OGC: 

 Requesting a latest observation 
 Encoding of OGC URNs when versioning is missing 
 Publishing of URIs by service providers 
 Using Semantic Web technologies to categorize SOS services 
 Publishing an SOS as an HTTP-Get service 
 Encoding vertical datums (Sea level based systems, geoid based systems and 

bottom based systems) in marine observations 
 
In 2009, the Oceans IE Phase 2 addressed the following tasks:  

 Automated metadata/software installation via PUCK protocol.  
 Offering of complex systems (e.g. observations systems containing other systems) 

such as collection of stations.  
 Linking data from SOS to out-of-band offerings.  
 Semantic Registry and Services.  
 Catalogue Service-Web Registry.  
 IEEE-1451/OGC-SWE harmonization  

 

9.6 OWS-6 Testbed (2009) 

The OWS-6 Testbed27 focused on integrating the SWE interfaces and encodings into 
cross-thread scenarios and workflows to demonstrate the ability of SWE specifications to

support operational needs. Among other security-focused demonstrations, the testbed 
included demonstrations of the use of the Common CBRN (Chemical, Biological, 
Radiological, Nuclear) Sensor Interface (CCSI). Emphasis for SWE during OWS-6 were: 

 Apply GeoRM and Trusted Services in the SWE environment 
 CCSI-Enabled CBRN Sensors into the SWE Environment 
 Sensor parameter adjustability and error propagation for georeferenceable 

imagery. Build on Georeferenceable imagery accomplishments of OWS-5 
 Harmonize SWE information models: SensorML, GML, UncertML 
 Events-based architecture including WNS 

Objectives in OWS-6 included illustrating dynamic query of SPS and showing on-
demand geolocation of JPIP stream using SensorML (Figure 21).  The figure shows the 
Space Time Toolkit client interacting with several distributed services using OGC service 
interfaces in order to request image acquisition by a SPOTIMAGE satellite.   Services 
included: 

 SPS – satellite imagery feasibility  
 WCS/JPIP server – streaming J2K image with CSM parameters encoded in 

SensorML  
 SensorML – on-demand geolocation

The OWS-6 Testbed developed the concept of Secure Sensor Web.30  The main purpose 
was to introduce standards-based security solutions for making the existing OGC Sensor 
Web Services ready towards the handling of sensors in the intelligence domain. This 
brings in the requirement for handling sensors that eventually produce classified 
information and the main objective of accreditation. In order to fulfill this, it would 
require a holistic security approach, but as this report is documenting the scientific 
findings under the OWS-6 initiative, it is limited to the given use case and its scenarios as 
well as the underlying architecture. 

The Engineering Report identified a firm set of requirements with the objective 
“classified information” and the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). 
The TCSEC (also called The Orange Book) defines the evaluation class “B” for trusted 
systems that are certified to handle classified information. In particular, the following 
requirements were considered in OWS-6 analysis:

 Mandatory Access Right Management 
 Authorization based on user identity and resource classification / user clearance 
 Integrity of the classification labels and its protection against modification 
 Tracking of actions 

 
For OWS-6,  the Internet Threat Model, as defined in RFC 3552, was assumed. As 
outlined in the “Internet Threat Model”, it was assumed that an insecure network and the 
capabilities of an adversary to gain control over the communication and exercise different 
attacks towards espionage and sabotage. This requires additional and more specific 
requirements under consideration, as stated in (all parts of) ISO 10181, “SECURITY 
FRAMEWORKS FOR OPEN SYSTEMS”. Basically, the distributed property of the 
Sensor Web System might not take affect, compared to a non-distributed system. But due 
to the distributed property, the implementation of requirements such as persistent 
protection of classified information needs to be ensured not only for a local system but 
also for multiple systems that are connected with each other over insecure 
communication channels. And even more complex for a Service Oriented Architecture, 
as it is the basis for the Sensor Web Services, the orchestration of services is dynamic 
which limits the applicability of network- or transport layer security.  
 
In order to propose a Secure Sensor Web, OWS-6 also analyzed the vulnerabilities and 
potential attacks that exist in the baseline and in the different ways of implementing the 
identified requirements. This was done for the baseline Sensor Web Services and the 
proposed security standards. Because this analysis is so exhausting the scope was limited 
to a given use case and its scenarios. 
 
9.7 OWS-7 Testbed (2010) 

The OWS-7 Testbed31 including a Sensor Fusion Enablement (SFE) Thread built on the 
SWE framework of standards that has achieved a degree of maturity through previous 
OWS interoperability initiatives and deployments worldwide.  SFE focused on 
integrating the SWE interfaces and encodings with workflow and web processing 
services to perform sensor fusion.  SFE continued the development of interoperability of 
SWE and the Common CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) Sensor 
Interface (CCSI). 

Emphasis for SFE during the OWS testbed was on the following: 
 Motion Video Fusion. Geo-location of motion video for display and processing. 

Change detection of motion video using Web Processing Service with rules. 
 Dynamic Sensor Tracking and Notification. Track sensors and notify users based 

on a geographic Area of Interest (AOI). The sensor and the user may be moving 
in space and time.

 CCSI-SWE Best Practice. Building on OWS-6, develop an ER to be considered 
by the OGC Technical Committee as a Best Practice. 
 

An objective in the OWS-7 testbed was to illustrate ability to use SWE services and 
encodings to support temporal differencing of ground-based video to (Figure 23).  The 
figure shows the Space Time Toolkit client interacting with several distributed services 
using OGC service interfaces in order to detect differences between video streams 
recorded at different times.   Services included: 

 SOS – video from vehicle-mounted camera 
 SOS – camera navigation data 
 WPS – Web Processing Service for change detection 
 SensorML – On-demand processing

9.8 OWS-8 Testbed (2011) 

The OWS-8 testbed33 developed use of SWE standards in the detection, tracking, and 
bookmarking of moving objects in video. The activities were: 

 In the context of OGC and ISO standards, provide an architectural viewpoint / 
information model for the usage of  

o video moving target indicator data (VMTI),  
o ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and  
o tracking information (NATO STANAGs 4607, 4609, 4676, MISB 

EG0903.03)  
 Provide traceability from a moving object back to the original base data through 

the use of a “bookmark” concept. 
 Implement OGC services and encodings, extended by the XML-Schema-based 

implementations; allow access to target information data and tracking data based 
on VMTI, GMTI, and STANAG 4676 information. 

 Identify any recommendations for enhancements to OGC, MISB, NATO 
standards supporting tracking architecture.

9.9 OWS-9 Testbed (2012) 

A GPS Study was conducted in OWS-9 to Investigate and prototype the capabilities of 
OGC standards to support GPS data product and message requirements to include 
definition of a new one-size-fits-all Variable Message Format (VMF) message capable of 
supporting all potential GPS ephemeris/data. 

The GPS study resulted in positive findings on the use of SWE to support GPS. SWE 
standards were found suitable for distributed post-processing of GPS information.  SWE 
Common Data 2.0 encodings were demonstrated to support an interoperable messaging 
description and encoding for the next generation GPS message streams into and out of the 
GPS navigation accuracy improvement services. The connection of SWE Common to 
SensorML 2.0 and the application of SensorML to describe the processing surrounding 
GPS navigation improvement were shown.

10 Implementation Maturity summary 

The different examples of listed projects within this document clearly show that the SWE 
standards help to realize various kinds of applications. In particular, they are instrumental 
for flexibly integrating various kinds of sensors and sensor data. The examples show the 
wide range of sensor information that can be provided via SWE services, from in-situ 
sensors (e.g. water gauges, weather stations) to  mobile sensors (e.g., in the OSIRIS 
project: tracked firemen, air quality sensors on busses, as well as UAVs), to remote 
sensors (satellites).  

One method to quantify the maturity is to assign Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) to 
the SWE standards.35    TRLs range from 1 to 9 with 9 being best.  Based on the 
information in this report, SWE Version 1 can be considered to be at TRL level 9, while 
SWE Version 2 is at level 6.  It is anticipated that implementations of SWE Version 2 
will rapidly advance its TRL to level 9.

The increased applications of SWE in commercial projects (e.g., projects with 
Wupperverband, EEA, Rijkswaterstaat, or DLZ-IT) demonstrate that SWE specifications 
are becoming more significant in practice. SWE enables the integration of (near) real-
time data into spatial data infrastructures and GIS systems. SWE facilitates the 
integration of various sensors by providing a unified and vendor independent interface.  

In conclusion, this study indicates that the OGC SWE specifications have reached a 
stable state and have been tested and operationally used in many applications and 
projects. Hence, the SWE specifications represent a meaningful and important extension 
to existing spatial data infrastructures, particularly, to flexibly and efficiently integrate 
sensor data and (near) real time data.

11 Future Work 

11.1 Further Development of SWE Standards 

After having SOS, SPS, O&M, as well as SWE Common models accepted as version 2.0 
standards, and SensorML 2.0 being close to the final voting, the next focus of the SWE 
working group is on the eventing and alerting technologies. Although the SES (and also 
the SAS) were successfully tested in various projects (e.g., OWS testbeds), neither of 
them has reached the status of an adopted standard yet. Currently, the Pub/Sub working 
group at OGC is working on the next iteration of an eventing specification. This forms 
the basis of a generic eventing service – not restricted to sensors – and is an important 
current working field.  

Further, the development of profiles for SWE specifications will be of relevance in the 
future. Through profiles, the applicability of specifications can be facilitated and their 
interoperability can be increased. An example profile is WaterML 2.0, an adopted 
standard which restricts and extends the O&M standard for the usage in the hydrology 
domain.  

11.2 SWE Clients 

As sensor assets are made available through the SWE services, it is important that they 
can immediately and readily be discovered, accessed, and integrated into visualization 
and analysis tools along with other sensor and Geospatial data.  To support SWE-enabled 
assets, client capabilities should include: 

 Enable web-service interface interaction with SOS and SPS 
 Enable ability to parse SWE encodings (e.g. SensorML, SWE Common, O&M) 
 Provide better support for handling highly-dynamic sensors and observations (for 

both real-time and archived modes) 
 Enable default and configurable portrayal of sensor data, including for example, 

time plots, trajectories, vertical profiles, geolocated imagery and video 
 Enable automatic and customized GUIs to support tasking of assets (SPS) and 

filtering of observations (SOS) 
 Enable on-demand processing of observations within the client (more advanced) 

 

Developing a SWE client that is able to accommodate various SOS server 
implementations remains very challenging. For some SWE implementations, the greatest 
technical challenges been encountered on the client side. The challenges are listed as 
follows. 

 In SOS 1.0, there is no basic profile of the SensorML, which dramatically 
increases the complexity of client programs when parsing SensorML documents 
from SOS services.

 Most data owners have difficulties to relate the feature of interests and procedures 
to their physical setup of sensor networks. Therefore training of data owners is 
required.  

 Sensor sampling frequency information is not defined in the SWE specifications 
(such as the Capabilities document). Sensors with high sampling rates can collect 
a large number of measurements in a short period of time. Without knowing the 
approximate data size to be requested from SOS servers, clients can be easily 
overwhelmed by very large responses from servers. Likewise, servers can also be 
overwhelmed by an unreasonable number of requests. Sensor sampling frequency 
information can help both clients and servers adapt to the capabilities of the other. 

Further refinements of the standards as well as maturing implementations are needed to 
address these client-side challenges. 

 

11.3 SWE Services Node 

Enabling sensor operators to quickly and easily deploy and web-enable sensors is one of 
the most critical capabilities for SWE implementation. OpenGeo has defined a SWE-
service node concept to support these needs.  OpenGeo is the geospatial division of 
OpenPlans, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that is the originator of the GeoServer 
open source application. OpenGeo is a member of the OGC.  

If properly designed, a SWE-service node would provide support for the discovery of 
dynamic assets and measurements, for access to real-time or archived observations, for 
tasking of sensors, models, or actuator systems, for publishing and subscribing to alerts, 
and for on-demand, on-board, configurable processing. In addition, such a node 
architecture would provide configurable security and plug-in-play modules to support an 
array of sensors and actuators. An architecture design is illustrated below. 

The following diagram depicts a small footprint server node that can be easily configured 
to support a wide variety of sensor and actuator assets, as well as meet ancillary 
requirements for security, database storage, and communication. In addition, an internal 
SensorML process execution engine will enable uploadable and configurable processing 
at the node. Such software could be used to rapidly deploy new assets, as well as to 
support legacy sensor deployments without interfering with existing operations. 

The diagram also illustrates interoperability of the SWE node with a larger Data Server 
perhaps built on OpenGeo GeoServer. In this approach, one can consider a large number 
of SWE node deployments providing access to lower-level assets, while the larger 
capacity Data Server could provide higher-level information based on integration and 
portrayal of these sensor data through a host of web services. 

The core of many of the software components for such a SWE node exists to some degree 
within the open-source software available on Google Code and at 52N. Integrating the

SWE node with other OpenGeo technology, such as GeoServer and PostGIS, could also 
provide many of the components.

11.4 SensorML Editor for Sensors and Processes 

SensorML provides the ability to fully describe sensor systems and others assets, as well 
as define the processes surrounding measurement and processing of observations. In 
such, it can be used to provide: 



OGC 13-032 

52 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 electronic spec sheets for sensor systems, specifying a wide range of 
characteristics and capabilities (e.g. sensitivity and operational limits), as well as 
position, contacts, references, history, and of course measured properties 

 a full mapping of components within a sensor system including explicit flow of 
data between the components 

 a complete description of the lineage or pedigree of an observation, including 
processes such as tasking request, sensor systems, processing, QA testing, and 
analysis 

 a explicitly defined process flow that can be executed to enable on-demand 
processing of observations or cross-queuing of sensor-actuator assets 

 

Currently, most SensorML descriptions are created in XML by using generic XML 
editors which can be a tedious and error-prone exercise, or by editing a previously-
defined SensorML template file which is limited to only those systems where templates 
have been created. Because of these complication and limitations, SensorML descriptions 
are often not created at all or do not use the full potential of SensorML. 

There is a strong need for SensorML editors that allow simple creation of sensor and 
process descriptions, as well as aggregate systems and processes. An initial open-source 
SensorML Process Editor was created at UAH but is in need of redesign, debugging, and 
refinement. This tool allows one to describe a single process or sensor component 
through a more human-friendly interface, and provides support for SensorML profiles 
defined in RelaxNG. 

A simple tool for creating descriptions of complex sensor systems and aggregate 
processes is also needed and should actually be simpler to develop than the individual 
process editor. 

In addition to editing, a very helpful tool is one that can parse a SensorML description 
and display the encoded information in a user-friendly view. Such a tool exists in the 
Open Source “Pretty View” tool developed at UAH and Botts-Inc., but it is in need of 
refinement and extension, and needs to be brought up to SensorML v2.0. It also needs to 
support a system or process network view that displays the components in an aggregate 
process, as well as the data flow between them. 

11.5 Development of SWE-based Web Processing Services (SWE-WPS) 

There is ongoing development of the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) that is 
expected to be very general in its design. There is a strong need for a SWE-specific 
profile that is highly compatible with the SWE services and encoding. In particular, a 
SWE-WPS would constrain its input and output to being SWE Common Data and would 
utilize SensorML to define the process. This effort should define such a profile and 
develop software to support easy configuration and deployment of SWE-WPS instances.

11.6 SWE Discovery Services 

The discovery capabilities for SWE need additional development to dealing with the 
dynamics and complexity of some sensor systems. Discovery in SWE can involve 
sensors and actuators, observations, alerts, processes, and of course the web services that 
enable these. 

Discovery of SWE assets and products may be more complicated than most typical 
geospatial data due to the following characteristics: 

 Sensor observations and tasking commands are typically highly dynamic and 
time-dependent, and thus vary on time frames as short as milliseconds. 

 Sensor and actuator assets, themselves, are often highly dynamic. They may 
change location, orientation, modes, calibration, and other measurement 
parameters on scales of milliseconds to years. Thus, within any 5-minute period, 
the sensors available to a user at a particular location may partially or completely 
change. 

 To be fully exploit a single observation, discovery requirements may include 
descriptions of the sensor and actuator assets involved, the set of tasking 
commands sent, related observation and alerts surrounding that measurement, the 
full lineage of that observation from tasking to measurement to processing to Q/A 
testing to analysis, and the availability of processes that can be applied to that 
observation in order to derive additional information. 

 A coarse-grained discovery solution (typical for most geospatial data) is not by 
itself capable of fully supporting the needs for SWE 

 

Discovery services for SWE may involve several technologies including: 

 Traditional registries for sensors and services 
 Tracking services that maintain a database of the state of all sensors 
 Peer-to-peer (P2P) capabilities for querying a very large numbers of deployed 

sensors and actuators 
 HTML-based textual discovery 
 Semantic Mediation 
 Other evolving technologies 

It is critical that an integrated architecture be developed that can meet the requirements 
outline above and that easily-deployed services be provided in the open-source 
community. Such an architecture will most likely consist of coarse-grained components 
that may reside at large data or control centers, augmented by smaller-footprint 
capabilities that reside nearer to the assets themselves.
