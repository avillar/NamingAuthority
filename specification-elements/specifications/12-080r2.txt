i. Abstract 

This standard describes the use cases, requirements and conceptual model for the 
OWS Context encoding standard. The goal of this standard is to provide a core 
model, which is extended and encoded as defined in extensions to this standard. A 
‘context document’ specifies a fully configured service set which can be exchanged 
(with a consistent interpretation)  among clients supporting the standard. 

The OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS Context) was created to allow a 
set of configured information resources (service set) to be passed between 
applications primarily as a collection of services. OWS Context is developed to 
support in-line content as well. The goal is to support use cases such as the 
distribution of search results, the exchange of a set of resources such as OGC Web 
Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), 
Web Coverage Service (WCS) and others in a ‘common operating picture’. 
Additionally OWS Context can deliver a set of configured processing services (Web 
Processing Service (WPS)) parameters to allow the processing to be reproduced on 
different nodes. 

OWS Context is aimed at replacing previous OGC attempts at providing such a 
capability (the Web Map Context WMC) which was reasonably successful but 
limited to WMS. Other work on the ‘Location Organizer Folder (LOF)’ was also 
taken into consideration. The concept of OWS Context, and the first prototype 
document was produced as part of OGC testbed OWS-7. See OGC 10-035r1, 
Information Sharing Engineering Report. In order to achieve mass market appeal, as 
well as being useful to a wider community, the use of OWS Context support to other 
existing standards was considered. Multiple encoding formats for OWS Context have 
been developed (ATOM, JSON). Each of these is described in a separate OWS 
Context Extensions to the Core model. 

This document concentrates on describing the OWS Context Model in abstract terms 
using UML. The document defines requirements and use cases. It also includes an 
abstract test suite to verify that encodings are compliant with the core specification. 
The intent of OWS Context is to allow many types of OGC Data Delivery service to 
be referenced and therefore exploited (for example, not just WMS but also WFS, 
WCS and WPS) but it does not explicitly define the encoding of these services in the 
core (only the general approach to be used for different types of service interface). 
Service explicit encodings are defined within the extension documents for ATOM 
and JSON. 

The abbreviation owc is used throughout this document for OWS Context.

1. Scope 

This document defines the conceptual model of the OWS Context document and the 
intended semantics of each element of the document. It also defines the requirements and 
the abstract test cases against which encoding specifications using specific carrier 
standards can be validated as compliant with OWS Context.  

2. Conformance 

This document defines a standardisation target for encodings which implement the OWS 
Context conceptual model in order to allow different encodings to have equivalent 
content and semantics so that they can be interoperable; it establishes a core requirements 
class: http://www.opengis.net/spec/owc/1.0/req/core with URI of 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/owc/1.0/req/core as well as a number of extensions, one per 
chosen service type. Requirements and conformance test URIs defined in this document 
are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/owc/1.0. All requirements in this specification 
are part of the core requirement stated above.  

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in 
Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for 
testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC 
Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site.  

In order to conform to this OGC® interface standard, an encoding standard shall choose to 
implement any one of the conformance levels specified in Annex A (normative). 

3. References 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this 
text, constitute provisions of this document. For dated references, subsequent 
amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated 
references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies.

4. Terms and Definitions 

The following terms and definitions are used throughout this document:  



OGC 12-080r2

4.1 Common Operating Picture  

A COP is a single identical display of relevant information shared by more than one 
command. A common operational picture facilitates collaborative planning and assists all 
echelons to achieve situational awareness.  

4.2 Context Document  

A context document is a document describing the set of resources  and their 
configuration, and ancillary information (area of interest, etc.) which defines the 
information representation of a common operating picture.  

4.3 Resource  

A resource is a configured set of information which is uniquely identifiable to a user. 
This can be realised as in-line or external content or by one or more configured web 
services.  

4.4 Area of Interest 

An area of interest is a geographic area which is significant to a user.  

5. Conventions 

This sections provides details and examples for any conventions used in the document. 
Examples of conventions are symbols, abbreviations, use of XML schema, or special 
notes regarding how to read the document. 

5.1 Abbreviated Terms  
 
owc - OGC Web Services Context  

5.2 UML notation  
 
Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagrams appearing in this 
specification are used as described in Sub clause 5.2 of OGC Web Service Common 
[OGC 06-121r9]. Further, the following conventions hold:  

 UML elements having a package name of “OWS Common” are those defined in 
the UML model of OWS Common [OGC 06-121r9].  
 

 UML elements having a package name of GML are those defined in the UML 
model of GML [OGC 07-036].  
 
 



OGC 12-080r2

 UML elements not qualified with a package name are those defined in this 
Standard.  
 

 UML data type Any is used here as an equivalence to XML’s xsd:any.  
 

5.3 Data dictionary tables  
 
The UML model data dictionary is specified herein in a series of tables. The contents of 
the columns in these tables are described in Sub clause 5.5 of [OGC 06-121r9]. The 
contents of these data dictionary tables are normative, including any table footnotes. For 
the reader’s convenience, table rows describing inherited components are shaded. 

5.4 Core and Extension Breakdown  
 
The OWS context standard follows the modular specification design pattern identified in 
REF 3. It was decided that the requirements would be split both on the basis of core and 
then specific service types (WMS, WFS etc.) and also on the basis of specific encoding 
of the document.

Figure 1 - OWS Context Requirement Class and Document Breakdown 

The core context document is largely agnostic of any particular  resource type, covering 
the basic structure and the extension model. A requirement class is then defined for each  
resource offering. This document covers all of the requirement classes for the conceptual 
model (the left grey box in figure 1 above).  These standardization target resources 
include services (WMS, WFS), encodings for in-line content (GML, GeoTiff) and storage 
for external content (GeoPackage). 

Various potential OWS Context encodings have been considered, in particular there are 
clear requirements for both an XML (Atom) encoding and a JSON Encoding. These are 
the subject of separate documents (Implementation Specifications).  

This standard recommends that any implementer of an application profile which defines 
an extensions conceptual model should define both an XML (Atom) and a JSON 
Encoding of the extension.

6. Use Cases and Requirements 

The Context Document goal is to support the exchange of a common operating picture or 
view between human users or applications such that the area of interest, time range, 
resources and their configuration is unambiguously exchanged between applications.  

6.1 Use Cases 

The OWS Context document is aimed at meeting a range of user context exchange 
requirements around shared situational awareness. Possible uses of the context document 
include: 

1. Exchange of a common view or common operating picture for shared situational 
awareness.  

2. Exchange of discovery results from various catalogue searches, to avoid 
duplication of effort.  

3. Exchange of configuration and/or results of an analysis or processing activity  

The exchange of a common operating picture is recognized as the most important usage 
of the OWS Context Document. As part of this there is the recognition that in some cases 
the services referenced may not be available.Therefore information outputs from services 
may be included as in-line content or referenced as external content in a  container such 
as a GeoPackage, andsome descriptive information (for example overlays or thumbnails) 
may need to be carried in the context document itself or alongside it.  

6.2 Overview of Key Requirements  

The above use cases lead to the following general requirements for an OWS Context 
document. All of these requirements are implicit in the core requirement class 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/owc/1.0/req/core shown (and detailed in section 7).

7. OWS Context Conceptual Model  

7.1 Overview 
This clause specifies the underlying OWS Context conceptual model for which an 
encoding can be created. It defines the mandatory requirements for context encoding and 
the necessary semantics of how that encoding should be interpreted. The conceptual 
model is broken down into various packages. These are shown in Figure 1 below.

a The rights described apply to the Context Document itself not to any of its contents. 
 

b These properties define the geographic area of interest and date/time interval of interest 
to the context user. They do not define the bounding extent (either in geographic area or 
time) of the referenced resources. The intention is not to provide the overall bounds or 
clipping extent but simply to indicate to a Context Document client the expected view of 
the information in area and time.

Requirement Txt: Implementations shall support the encoding of all of the mandatory and 
optional parameters of the Resource Class and meet all of the tabulated 
constraints and notes 

This class describes the resource elements which supply the information layers used in 
the Context Document. Resource, while it can be used bare, is typically classified by 
owc:MediaCode indicating the type of information encoded in the resource. The resource 
offers multiple ways to pass a configured resource, in-line content, by absolute URI and 
by service Content which needs to be interpreted by an intelligent client. While there may 
be limitations in the individual encoding, each of these types shall be semantically 
equivalent, i.e. alternative representations of the same information (they can for example 
have different resolutions but should not show fundamentally different information).

Table 6- StyleSet Class Properties 

 

Note: StyleSet cannot be derived from the service request, and it is a list of relevant styles 
which could be applied if the service supports dynamic styling, for example if the WMS 
is an FPS and supports SLD. The intention is that the client could visualize the layer 
using the getMap Call (which would have a defined styling) but could also offer the user 
a selection of alternative styles for the layer. These would be derived from the style list 
parameter.
