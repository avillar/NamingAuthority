Warning 

OGC offical documents use a triple decimal-dot notation (i.e. MM.xx.ss). This document 
may be identified as MM.xx (Major.minor) and may include increments to the third dot series 
(schema changes) without any modification to this document, or the version displayed on the 
document. This means, for example, that a document labeled with versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 or 
even 1.1.9 are exactly the same except for modifications to the official schemas that are 
maintained and perpetually located at: http://schemas.opengis.net/.  Note that corrections to 
the document are registered via corrigendums.  A corrigendum will change the base 
document and notice will be given by appending a c# to the version (where # specifies the 
corrigendum number).  In corrigendums that correct both the schemas and the base 
document, the third triplet of the document verion will increment and the ‘c1’ or subsequent 
identifier will be appended, however the schemas will only increase the third triplet of the 
version. 
 
Recipients of this document are invited to submit, with their comments, notification of 
any relevant patent rights of which they are aware and to provide supporting 
documentation.

i. Preface 

This is WCS version 1.1.1 c1, and builds on OWS Common version 1.1.0 [OGC06-121r3]. 
It also builds on WCS version 1.1.0 [OGC 06-083r8]. 

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r3], 
which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to 
indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this specification.

v. Revision history 

This WCS 1.1.1c1 is Corrigendum 1 of WCS 1.1.0, as documented in [OGC 07-066]. 
Briefly, the changes are: 

a) Fixed minor inconsistencies, spelling mistakes, and added some minor clarifications 

b) Aligned with OWS-Common version 1.1.0 

WCS 1.1.0 was almost a complete rewrite of WCS 1.0.0, with many editorial changes and 
detailed streamlining of schema files resulting from OWS Common conformance. However, 
the two versions of the specification share the same overall structure. WCS 1.1.0 introduced 
(only) the following functional changes: 

a) Use of GridCRS in coverage descriptions and requests 
(See 9.3.1.2, 10.2.1.1, 10.2.2, 10.3.4, 10.3.6, and Annexes F and G) 

b) Hierarchical coverage descriptions (See 8.3.4.4) 

c) Multiple fields per coverage 
(See 9.3.1.3, 9.3.2.1, 10.2.1.2, 10.2.2.1, 10.2.2.2, and Tables 18, 26-29) 

d) XML and (optionally) asynchronous GetCoverage responses (See 10.3.11) 

e) Different approach to coverage formats; reliance on encoding profiles (See 9.3.2.2) 

Many of the changes were the direct or indirect result of addressing written change proposals, 
as summarized in OGC 06-116. 

vi. Changes to the OGC Abstract Specification 

OGC® Abstract Specification Topic 6: The Coverage Type and its Subtypes (which includes 
ISO 19123) requires the following change to accommodate the technical contents of this 
document:  

Spatial interpolation needs to be a (repeatable) property of a single field in the range of a 
coverage, not a property of the coverage or of its range as a whole. Currently, the 
interpolationType is an attribute of the CV_ContinuousQuadrilateralGridCoverage class, 
which is associated to one CV_GridValuesMatrix. This CV_GridValuesMatrix contains a 
sequence of values of Record type, where each Record can contain multiple “fields”. 
However, different fields may require the use of different interpolation types; and more than 
one interpolation method may be associated with a single field.

vii. Future work 

Future versions of this WCS specification are expected to consider various expansions of the 
abilities specified herein, some adding abilities that were deliberately not included in Version 
1.1.0. Some of the possible expansions thus include: 

a) Expand supported coverage types beyond grid coverages. 

b) Expand ability to retrieve elevation subset of a coverage, beyond current regularly spaced 
(grid) elevations. 

c) Expand ability to retrieve spatial subset of a coverage, beyond current regularly spaced 
(grid) positions. 

d) Expand ability to store coverage outputs, for later retrieval. 

e) Add WSDL description of SOAP encodings 

f) Add ability to Retrieve multiple coverages in one GetCoverage operation request 

g) Add optional interface operation(s) to input new coverages and update existing coverages 
offered by a WCS server 

h) Expand Annex A to specify abstract test suites.

Foreword 

This version 1.1.1c1 of the Web Coverage Service (WCS) Specification supersedes previous 
version 1.1.0 [OGC 06-083r8]. Technical changes from the version 1.0 include building on 
the OGC Web Services Common Specification [OGC 06-121r3] and a substantially revised 
Capabilities schema; new schemas and syntax for operation requests (GetCoverage, 
DescribeCoverage); and integration with GML 3.1. The changes in WCS 1.1.1c1 from WCS 
1.1.0 are summarized in [OGC 07-066r2]. 

This document includes eight annexes; Annexes A, E, F, and H are normative, and Annexes 
B, C, D, and G are informative. 

Some elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial 
Consortium shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Introduction 

The Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic retrieval of geospatial data as 
"coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing space-varying 
phenomena. 

A WCS provides access to potentially detailed and rich sets of geospatial information, in 
forms that are useful for client-side rendering, multi-valued coverages, and input into 
scientific models and other clients. The WCS may be compared to the OGC Web Map 
Service (WMS) and the Web Feature Service (WFS); like them it allows clients to choose 
portions of a server's information holdings based on spatial constraints and other criteria. 

Unlike the WMS [OGC 06-042], which portrays spatial data to return static maps 
(rendered as pictures by the server), the Web Coverage Service provides available data 
together with their detailed descriptions; defines a rich syntax for requests against these 
data; and returns data with its original semantics (instead of pictures) which may be 
interpreted, extrapolated, etc. – and not just portrayed. 

Unlike WFS [OGC 04-094], which returns discrete geospatial features, the Web 
Coverage Service returns coverages representing space-varying phenomena that relate a 
spatio-temporal domain to a (possibly multidimensional) range of properties. 

The Web Coverage Service provides three operations: GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage, 
and GetCoverage. The GetCapabilities operation returns an XML document describing the 
service and brief descriptions of the coverages that clients may request. Clients would 
generally run the GetCapabilities operation and cache its result for use throughout a session, 
or reuse it for multiple sessions. When the GetCapabilities operation does not return such 
descriptions, then equivalent information must be available from a separate source, such as 
an image catalog. 

The DescribeCoverage operation lets clients request a full description of one or more 
coverages served by a particular WCS server. The server responds with an XML document 
that fully describes the identified coverages. 

The GetCoverage operation is normally run after GetCapabilities and DescribeCoverage 
operation responses have shown what requests are allowed and what data are available. The 
GetCoverage operation returns a coverage (that is, values or properties of a set of geographic 
locations), encoded in a well-known coverage format. Its syntax and semantics bear some 
resemblance to the WMS GetMap and WFS GetFeature requests, but several extensions 
support the retrieval of coverages rather than static maps or discrete features.

Web Coverage Service (WCS) Implementation Specification 

1 Scope 

This document specifies how a Web Coverage Service (WCS) describes and delivers multi-
dimensional coverage data over the World Wide Web. This version of the Web Coverage 
Service is limited to describing and requesting grid (or "simple”) coverages. 

Grid coverages have a domain comprised of regularly spaced locations along 0, 1, 2, or 3 
axes of a spatial coordinate reference system. Their domain may also have a time dimension, 
which may be regularly or irregularly spaced. A coverage defines, at each location in the 
domain, a set of fields that may be scalar-valued (such as elevation), or vector-valued (such 
as brightness values in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum). These fields (and 
their values) are known as the range of the coverage. 

The WCS interface, while limited in this version to regular grid coverages, is designed to 
extend in future versions to other coverage types defined in OGC Abstract Specification 
Topic 6, "The Coverage Type" [OGC 00-106].

6 WCS overview 

The specified Web Coverage Service (WCS) interface supports electronic retrieval of 
geospatial data as "coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing space-
varying phenomena. A WCS provides access to potentially detailed and rich sets of 
geospatial information, in forms that are useful for client-side rendering and input into 
scientific models and other clients. 

The WCS interface specifies three operations that may be requested by a WCS client and 
performed by a WCS server: 

a) GetCapabilities (required implementation by servers) – This operation allows a client to 
request the service metadata (or Capabilities) document. This XML document describes 
the abilities of the specific server implementation, usually including brief descriptions of 
the coverages available on the server. This operation also supports negotiation of the 
specification version being used for client-server interactions. Clients would generally 
request the GetCapabilities operation and cache its result for use throughout a session, or 
reuse it for multiple sessions. When the GetCapabilities operation does not return 
descriptions of its available coverages, that information must be available from a separate 
source, such as an image catalog. 

b) DescribeCoverage (required implementation by servers) – This operation allows a client 
to request full descriptions of one or more coverages served by a particular WCS server. 
The server responds with an XML document that fully describes the identified coverages. 

c) GetCoverage (required implementation by servers) – This operation allows a client to 
request a coverage comprised of selected range properties at a selected set of geographic 
locations. The server extracts the response data from the selected coverage, and encodes 
it in a known coverage format. The GetCoverage operation is normally run after 
GetCapabilities and DescribeCoverage operation responses have shown what requests 
are allowed and what data are available. 

Many of these interface aspects that are common with other OGC Web Services (OWSs) are 
specified in the OGC Web Services Common Specification [OGC 06-121r3]. These common 
aspects are normatively referenced herein, instead of being repeated in this specification. 

Figure 1 is a simple UML class diagram summarizing the WCS interface. This class diagram 
shows that the WebCoverageServer interface class inherits the getCapabilities operation from 
the OGCWebService interface class, and adds the getCoverage and describeCoverage 
operations. (This capitalization of names uses the OGC/ISO profile of UML.) A more 
complete UML model of the WCS interface is provided in Annex D (informative).

NOTE  In this UML diagram, the request and response for each operation is shown as a single parameter 
that is a data structure containing multiple lower-level parameters, which are discussed in subsequent clauses. 
The UML classes modeling these data structures are included in the complete UML model in Annex D. 

Each of the three operations is described in more detail in subsequent clauses. 

7 Shared aspects 

7.1 Introduction 

This clause specifies aspects of the WCS behavior that are independent of particular 
operations or are shared by several operations. 

7.2 Operation request encoding 

All WCS operation requests may use HTTP GET with KVP encoding or use HTTP POST 
with either XML or SOAP encoding, as specified in Clause 11 of [OGC 06-121r3].  

7.3 XML Schema notes 

The data type of many parameters is specified as “Character String type, not empty”. In the 
XML Schemas specified, these parameters are encoded with the xsd:string type, which does 
NOT require that these strings not be empty.  

7.4 Operation response encoding and reserved characters 

All operation responses shall comply with the XML syntax. In addition, several parameter 
values provided in CoverageSummary and CoverageDescription operation responses shall be 
usable literally (“as-is”) in subsequent DescribeCoverage and GetCoverage operation 
requests to the specific server, encoded in KVP or XML. Therefore, in stating values for 
these parameters, servers shall avoid, encode, or escape any “special” characters that could be 



OGC 07-067r2 

6 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

interpreted as part of either the XML markup (‘<’ ‘>’ ‘--’ ‘&’ etc.) or the KVP syntax (‘?’ 
‘=’ ‘&’ etc.) of subsequent requests. 

In particular, to support XML requests, operation responses shall avoid special characters, or 
encode or escape them using character or numeric entities (e.g., “&gt;” or “&#62;”in lieu of 
“>”) as defined in XML [W3C 2004]. To support KVP requests, operation responses shall 
avoid special characters, or URL-encode them (e.g., “%3F” for “?”) as defined in [RFC 
2396]. 

7.5 CRS definitions and references 

7.5.1 WCS use of CRSs 

WCS operation requests and responses frequently include references to a defined Coordinate 
Reference System (CRS), and sometimes include a CRS definition. A defined CRS is 
required for spatial referencing by coordinates, and is a coordinate system which is related to 
an object by a datum. This specification makes use of material in several other OGC 
documents that specify how to define and reference CRSs. 

In many cases, WCS operation requests and responses transfer only references to defined 
CRSs, not the actual CRS definitions. Each referenced CRS shall be defined somewhere, but 
that definition may not be electronically accessible or encoded in XML. Nonetheless, the 
referenced definitions often need to be used by WCS server software. 

7.5.2 CRS definitions 

OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2 “Geographic information — Spatial referencing by 
coordinates” [OGC 05-103], which contains ISO/DIS 19111, specifies how to define many 
types of CRSs, including the Datums and Coordinate Systems that define a CRS. Clause 7 of 
that document specifies the following types of CRSs, all of which might be used with a WCS 
grid coverage: 

a) GeodeticCRS (formerly GeographicCRS and GeocenticCRS) 
b) ProjectedCRS 
c) VerticalCRS 
d) CompoundCRS 
e) ImageCRS 
f) DerivedCRS 
g) EngineeringCRS 

Clause 12 of GML 3.1.1 [OGC 03-105r1] specifies how to XML encode the definitions of all 
these types of CRSs, based on an older version of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2 [OGC 
04-046r3]. Three GML 3.1.1 profiles extract the parts of GML 3.1.1 that appear useful to a 
WCS, namely: 

a) OGC 05-094r1, GML 3.1.1 CRS support profile, which is used by the following two 
profiles 



OGC 07-067r2 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  7 

b) OGC 05-095r1, GML 3.1.1 common CRSs profile, which covers GeographicCRS, 
ProjectedCRS, VerticalCRS, and CompoundCRS definitions 

c) OGC 05-096r1, GML 3.1.1 grid CRSs profile, which covers ImageCRS and 
DerivedCRS definitions 

Annex F in this document specifies how to XML encode a GridCRS definition, in a 
simplified manner that is loosely based on a DerivedCRS. 

7.5.3 CRS references 

Clause 10.3 of OWS Common [OGC 06-121r3] specifies how CRSs shall be referenced. A 
URL can be used to reference a definition that is available using this URL. When not in the 
same XML document, those definitions shall be electronically available using this URL. 
Alternately, a URN in the “ogc” URN namespace can be used, and often should be used, to 
reference a CRS definition identified in that “ogc” URN namespace. 

The format of URNs in the “ogc” namespace is recommended in Clause 7 of OGC Best 
Practices Paper [OGC 06-023r1], “Definition identifier URNs in OGC namespace”. Some 
recommended URN formats include parameter values that allow that URN to be used for an 
entire family of CRSs (such as different origins). 

Numerous specific URN values for CRSs and components are currently specified in:  

a) Clause 8 and Annex A of [OGC 06-023r1], “Definition identifier URNs in OGC 
namespace”, for numerous CRSs and components 

b) Clause 10 of OGC 05-096r1, GML 3.1.1 grid CRSs profile, for ImageCRSs, 
DerivedCRSs, and components (including URNs for most possible 2D ImageCRSs) 

c) Subclause F.3 in this document, for three specific OperationMethods (expected to be 
referenced by most 2D GridCRS definitions) 

7.6 BoundingBox use in WCS 

7.6.1 General terms 

This specification uses the BoundingBox and WGS84BoundingBox data structures, specified 
in Subclause 10.2 of OWS Common [OGC 06-121r3], to express the minimum rectangular 
bounding region around (available or requested) coverage data. In a Bounding Box data 
structure, the LowerCorner defines the edges of the (available or requested) region in the 
directions of decreasing coordinate values in a CRS (normally the algebraic minimum 
coordinates), and the UpperCorner defines the edges in the directions of increasing 
coordinate values (usually the algebraic maximum coordinates). For continuous 
(interpolatable) grid coverages, these values shall be computed from the areas of all the 
(available or requested) coverage grid cells with all corners at recorded grid points. 

NOTE 1 Inclusion of the areas of all grid cells is not necessarily the same as inclusion of all the grid points, 
when the grid coverage spans the antimeridian as discussed below. 



OGC 07-067r2 

8 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

In keeping with ISO 19123, WCS considers only grids whose points lie at the corners (not 
the centres) of the grid cells. This document thus primarily considers “continuous” grid 
coverages, not “discrete” grid coverages, as those terms are defined in ISO 19123. As 
illustrated in Figure 2 below, grid points (a, b, c, d) define a grid cell (U) and are surrounded 
by "sample spaces" (A, B, C, D) as those terms are used in Subclause 8.2.2 of ISO 19123. 

 

Figure 2 — Grid points, grid cells, and sample spaces 

NOTE 2  For these sample spaces, this document avoids using terms such as “sample grid” or “pixels”, 
although such terms are often used elsewhere. 

The following subclauses clarify the use of such a bounding box near discontinuities in a 
geographic CRS, and the handling of grid points at the edges of the coverage. 

7.6.2 Spanning the antimeridian of a geographic CRS 

In a geographic CRS, longitude values are often defined with a finite extent (e.g., from -180 
degrees to +180 degrees). The minimum and maximum longitude limits define a single line 
(on the ellipsoid, sphere, or cylinder), known as the antimeridian, across which longitude 
values are discontinuous: as this line is crossed, longitude changes abruptly (e.g., going West 
from a little more than -180 degrees to a little less than +180 degrees). This necessitates an 
“extended” interpretation of the Bounding Box definition: 

A Bounding Box defined in a geographic CRS (or a WGS84BoundingBox) 
whose LowerCorner longitude is greater than that of its UpperCorner shall 
describe a region that crosses the longitude discontinuity. 

EXAMPLE  A bounding region encompassing the Pacific Ocean could be described by a BoundingBox with 
a positive LowerCorner longitude and a negative UpperCorner longitude. 

NOTE Users and implementers may avoid using the above “extended” interpretation of the Bounding Box 
by EITHER (a) using a CRS whose value discontinuity lies outside the minimum bounding region (e.g., a 
geographic CRS with a different prime meridian); OR (b) treating longitude as unbounded but periodic (using the 
XML Schema strings “-INF” and “INF” to denote negative and positive infinity). (See also Subclause 10.2.5 of 
OWS Common [OGC 06-121r3].) 

If the data represented by the coverage is intended to be continuous (or interpolatable) 
across the antimeridian, then a server should perform spatial interpolation near and across the 
antimeridian just as it does elsewhere. 



OGC 07-067r2 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  9 

7.6.3 Treatment of edge grid points 

The spatial extent of a grid coverage extends only as far as the outermost grid points 
contained in the bounding box. It does NOT include any area (partial or whole grid cells or 
sample spaces) beyond those grid points. 

NOTE  This bounding box is NOT the extent sometimes considered, which also includes rectangular sample 
spaces (pixels) centered on the outermost grid points – as indicated in Subclause 7.3.3 6 of WMS 1.3 [OGC 04-
042]. Such pixel extents are often poor approximations of the sensor physics / grid data collection process. 

EXAMPLE The extent of a global data set in WGS84 geographic decimal degrees with a grid spacing of 
1.0 degree might be expressed as a WGS84BoundingBox with LowerCorner and UpperCorner longitudes of 
(respectively) -179.5 and +179.5, or -179.0 and +180.0, when that data set is not considered continuous 
(interpolatable) across the antimeridian at 180 degrees. When that data set is interpolatable across the 
antimeridian, the LowerCorner and UpperCorner longitudes (respectively) might be -180 and +180 (with 
redundant first and last columns of data), or –INF and INF. 

8 GetCapabilities operation (mandatory) 

8.1 Introduction 

The mandatory GetCapabilities operation allows WCS clients to retrieve service metadata 
from a WCS server. The response to a GetCapabilities request shall be an XML document 
containing service metadata about the server, usually including summary information about 
the data collections from which coverages may be requested. This clause specifies KVP and 
XML encoding of a GetCapabilities request and the XML document that a WCS server shall 
return to describe its capabilities. 

8.2 GetCapabilities operation request 

8.2.1 Request contents 

The GetCapabilities operation request shall be as specified in Subclauses 7.2.2 through 7.2.4 
of [OGC 06-121r3]. The value of the “service” parameter shall be “WCS”. The allowed set 
of service metadata (or Capabilities) XML document section names and meanings shall be as 
specified in Tables 6 and 10 in Subclauses 7.3.3 and 7.4.2 of [OGC 06-121r3]. 

The “Multiplicity and use” column in Table 3 of [OGC 06-121r3] specifies the optionality of 
each listed parameter in the GetCapabilities operation request. Table 1 specifies the 
implementation of those parameters by WCS clients and servers.

  <documentation>Request to a WCS to perform the GetCapabilities 
operation. This operation allows a client to retrieve a Capabilities XML 
document providing metadata for the specific WCS server. In this XML

8.2.4 SOAP encoding 

WCS servers may implement SOAP version 1.2 transfer of the GetCapabilities operation 
request as specified in Annex E, using the XML encoding specified above. 

8.3 GetCapabilities operation response 

8.3.1 Normal response 

The normal response to a GetCapabilities operation request shall be a service metadata (or 
Capabilities) document as specified in Subclause 7.4.2 of OWS common [OGC 06-121r3], 
and shown in the UML class diagram in Figure 3. The WCS service metadata document shall 
contain the four optional sections specified in Table 2. Depending on the values in the 
Sections parameter of the GetCapabilities operation request, any combination of these 
sections may be requested and returned.

server, as specified in Subclauses 8.3.5 and 8.3.6 below. 

 
In addition to these sections, each service metadata document shall include the mandatory 
“version” parameter. Each service metadata document may include the optional 
“updateSequence” parameter specified in Table 7 in Subclause 7.4.1 of [OGC 06-121r3]. 

8.3.2 OperationsMetadata section contents 

8.3.2.1 Overview 

The OperationsMetadata section provides metadata about the operations specified by this 
service and implemented by this server, including the URLs for operation requests. The 
contents and organization of this section shall be as specified in Subclauses 7.4.5, 7.4.8, and 
owsOperationsMetadata.xsd of [OGC 06-121r3]. 

The mandatory values of various (XML) attributes shall be as specified in Table 3. In Table 
3, the “Attribute name” column uses dot-separator notation to identify parts of a parent item. 
The “Attribute value” column references an operation parameter, in this case an operation 
name, and the meaning of including that value is listed in the right column. 

Table 3 — Required values of OperationsMetadata section attributes 

Attribute name Attribute value Meaning of attribute value 
GetCapabilities The GetCapabilities operation is implemented by this server. 
DescribeCoverage The DescribeCoverage operation is implemented by this server. 

Operation.name 

GetCoverage The GetCoverage operation is implemented by this server. 
 
In addition, there are many optional values of “name” attribute and “value” elements within 
optional Parameter and Constraint elements in the OperationsMetadata section, which may be 
included when considered useful. These Parameter and Constraint elements are for recording 
the domains of various parameters and quantities.

EXAMPLE 1 The domain of the “exceptionCode” parameter could record all the codes implemented for each 
operation by that specific server. Similarly, each of the GetCapabilities operation optional request parameters 
might have its domain recorded. 

EXAMPLE 2 The domain of the “Sections” parameter in the GetCapabilities operation request could record 
all the sections implemented by that specific server. 

8.3.2.2 Indicating allowed encodings 

All WCS servers shall specify the encodings that may be sent using HTTP POST transfer of 
operation requests. Specifically, an ows:Constraint element shall be included, with 
“PostEncoding” as the value of the “name” attribute and specifying different allowed values 
for each allowed encoding: 

a) The value “SOAP” shall indicate that SOAP encoding is allowed, as specified in Annex 
E. 

b) The value “XML” shall indicate that XML encoding is allowed (without SOAP message 
encapsulation). 

When the HTTP POST connect point URL is different for different encodings of the 
operation requests, this ows:Constraint element shall be included in each Post element. When 
the connect point URL is the same for all encodings of all operation requests, this 
ows:Constraint element shall be included in the OperationsMetadata element. 

8.3.2.3 Indicating support for the “store” parameter 

All WCS servers shall specify whether or not that server implements the “store” parameter in 
GetCoverage operation requests, doing this in an ows:Operation element for the GetCoverage 
operation. When this WCS server implements the “store” parameter, this shall be specified 
by including an ows:Parameter element with “store” as the “name” attribute value, and both 
“True” and “False” as allowed Values. When this WCS server does not implement the 
“store” parameter, this shall be specified by including an ows:Parameter element with “store” 
as the “name” attribute value, and only “False” as an allowed Value. 

8.3.3 Contents section 

8.3.3.1 Overview 

The Contents section shall contain and/or reference summary metadata about the coverages 
available. It shall be structured as shown in the UML class diagram in Figure 4. The 
attributes and associations of the two new classes shall include the data structure and 
parameters specified in Table 4. Table 5 lists the contents of the CoverageSummary data 
structure, allowing these summaries to be arranged in a hierarchy.

NOTE  The CoverageSummary and Other‌Source parts of the Contents section are not mutually exclusive, 
although we expect that only one will often be included. This document specifies no meaning to inclusion of both 
parts, with or without overlapping information. 

8.3.3.2 CoverageSummary 

The CoverageSummary provides a summary-level description of coverage data available 
from a WCS server. Clients may be able to formulate simple GetCoverage requests based 
only on this information. However, in order to make more finely tuned GetCoverage 
requests, clients will usually need to obtain further details about a particular coverage, using 
the DescribeCoverage operation (see Clause 9). Table 5 lists the contents of the 
CoverageSummary data structure, allowing these summaries to be arranged in a hierarchy.

are included, this shall be interpreted as the union (or combination) of the areas of these bounding boxes. Table 6 below specifies 
when a WGS84BoundingBox is needed.  Currently, this WCS specification provides no way for a server to specify the precision of a 
bounding box.

8.3.3.3 Reserved characters in CoverageSummary parameter values 

The following CoverageSummary parameter values shall be usable literally (“as-is”) in 
DescribeCoverage or GetCoverage operation requests to the originating server, encoded in 
KVP or XML: 

a) Identifier 

b) SupportedFormat 

In stating values for these parameters, servers shall avoid, encode, or escape certain special 
characters, as detailed in Subclause 7.4, to avoid misinterpreting them as part of the XML or 
KVP syntax of subsequent requests. 

8.3.3.4 CoverageSummary hierarchy 

The CoverageSummary data structures may form a hierarchical tree. When the 
CoverageSummaries form a tree, a subsidiary (child) CoverageSummary inherits some of the 
(optional) parameters from its higher level (parent) CoverageSummaries in the hierarchy. In 
this subclause, a “leaf” CoverageSummary is defined as one that has no subsidiary (child) 
CoverageSummary. Table 6 specifies the inheritance rules for the inherited parameters.

Not inherited 

a Although these parameters are not inherited by a subsidiary coverage, the values of these parameters for all higher levels in a 
hierarchy of coverages may be relevant and are available to clients. 
b A value for this mandatory parameter shall be provided at all levels in the hierarchy. 
c Values for these optional parameters may be provided at all levels in the hierarchy. 
d When no value is provided for a coverage, any value recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of coverages shall apply to this 
coverage. When a value is provided for a coverage, it overrides any value recorded for a higher level in a hierarchy of coverages. 
e For each ”leaf” CoverageSummary, at least one WGS84BoundingBox shall be either recorded or inherited, for each georectified 
or georeferenced coverage. (This WGS84BoundingBox is included to simplify searching for coverages that might overlap a specified 
region.) 
f The full list of CRSs supported by a coverage shall be the union of the CoverageSummary’s own supportedCRSs and those 
supported by its parent CoverageSummaries. These SupportedCRSs can be referenced as the baseCRS of a GridCRS specified in the 
Ouput part of a GetCoverage request. In addition, the GetCoverage operation response can be expressed in the ImageCRS of each 
offered coverage, which shall not be referenced here. These SupportedCRSs can also be referenced in the BoundingBox in the 
DomainSubset part of a GetCoverage request.  
g The full list of formats supported by a coverage shall be the union of the CoverageSummary’s own supportedFormats and those 
supported by its parent CoverageSummaries. 
h There can be a dependency of SupportedCRS values on SupportedFormat values, as described in Subclause 10.3.5. 

 
NOTE 1 This specification supports a CoverageSummary hierarchy only as a means to simplify and shorten 
the Capabilities document. No other possible meanings and uses of a CoverageSummary hierarchy are specified 
here.  

A “leaf” CoverageSummary shall have an Identifier parameter; a non-leaf CoverageSummary 
may have an Identifier. A WCS server that supplies a CoverageSummary containing an 
Identifier element shall accept that Identifier value in DescribeCoverage and GetCoverage 
operation requests. A client shall not issue a DescribeCoverage or GetCoverage request for a 
coverage whose CoverageSummary has no Identifier parameter.  

NOTE 2 This specification does not organize CoverageDescription data structures into a hierarchy, and the 
CoverageSummary hierarchy is not encoded in the CoverageDescription. A CoverageDescription  provides all of 
the information necessary to request a coverage using the GetCoverage operation, and to correctly interpret the 
results from that GetCoverage operation. A coverage with a non-leaf CoverageSummary, when it has an 
Identifier, is described via DescribeCoverage, and requested via GetCoverage, in the same way as one with a leaf 
CoverageSummary. 

NOTE 3 This subclause implies that only coverages which satisfy all the requirements to be correctly called a 
grid coverage, as specified in ISO 19123, can have an Identifier. Such an offered coverage may be a “virtual” 
coverage, which is not stored but is assembled (in an unspecified way) by the server in response to a 
GetCoverage operation.    



OGC 07-067r2 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  19 

8.3.3.5 OtherSource 

The optional OtherSource parameter references a catalogue server from which coverage 
metadata is available. This ability is expected to be used by servers with thousands or 
millions of coverages, for which searching a catalogue is more feasible than retrieving and 
then searching a very large Capabilities XML document. When no CoverageSummary items 
are included, and one or more catalogue servers are referenced, this set of catalogues shall 
contain current metadata summaries for all the coverages currently available from this WCS 
server, with the metadata for each such coverage referencing this WCS server. 

NOTE There is no requirement that all the coverages available from a specific WCS be listed in the 
Capabilities document (so that a catalogue may harvest them). For example, a server may need to serve on the 
order of (~) 10,000,000 distinct coverages with ~10,000 new coverages per day! In that case, this OtherSource 
may point to one or more catalogues that may be searched. For each catalogued coverage, that catalogue shall list 
the WCS server(s) that offer(s) that coverage, and the coverage identifier(s) used. 

Any catalogue servers that are referenced should implement one of the interfaces specified in 
the OGC Catalogue Services Specification [OGC 04-021r3], preferably using the CSW 
protocol binding specified in Clause 10 of [OGC 04-021r3]. For any OGC catalogue protocol 
binding, an Application Profile for cataloging WCS coverages should be formally specified. 
Similarly, when no CoverageSummary items are included, a WCS Application Profile should 
be formally specified. 

8.3.3.6 Implementation requirements 

The “Multiplicity and use” columns in Table 9 through Table 17 in [OGC 06-121r3], and in 
Table 4 and Table 5 of this document, specify the optionality of each listed parameter and 
data structure in the GetCapabilities operation response. All the “mandatory” parameters and 
data structures shall be implemented by all WCS servers, using a specified value(s). 

Implementation by WCS servers of the “updateSequence” parameter defined in Table 9 of 
[OGC 06-121r3] is optional. As indicated in Table 1 of this document, the “updateSequence” 
parameter may be implemented by each WCS server, and then shall also be required in the 
operation response. 

All other “optional” parameters and data structures, in the GetCapabilities operation 
response, should be implemented by all WCS servers using specified values, whenever and 
wherever each is considered useful metadata for that server. 

8.3.3.7 XML encoding 

The Contents section of the Capabilities document shall be XML encoded. The XML Schema 
Document that specifies the Contents section for the WCS is built upon the owsContents.xsd 
schema, is named wcsContents.xsd, and is attached. 

8.3.4 Capabilities document XML encoding 

The XML Schema fragment for a WCS service metadata document extends the 
ows:CapabilitiesBaseType in owsGetCapabilities.xsd from [OGC 06-121r3]:  

<element name="Capabilities"> 
 <complexType> 
  <complexContent> 



OGC 07-067r2 

20 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

   <extension base="ows:CapabilitiesBaseType"> 
    <sequence> 
     <element ref="wcs:Contents" minOccurs="0"/> 
    </sequence> 
   </extension> 
  </complexContent> 
 </complexType> 
</element> 
 

8.3.5 GetCapabilities document SOAP encoding 

WCS servers that implement SOAP version 1.2 transfer of GetCoverage operation requests 
shall also implement SOAP transfer of the corresponding GetCoverage operation responses. 
These operation responses shall be encoded as specified in Annex E, using the XML 
encoding referenced above. 

8.3.6 Exceptions 

When a WCS server encounters an error while performing a GetCapabilities operation, it 
shall return an exception report message as specified in Clause 8 of [OGC 06-121r3]. The 
allowed exception codes shall include those listed in Table 8 of Subclause 7.4.1 of [OGC 06-
121r3] when the updateSequence parameter is implemented by the server. 

8.4 GetCapabilities operation examples 

To request a Capabilities document, a client could issue the following GetCapabilities 
minimal operation request encoded as KVP: 

http://hostname:port/path? 
service=WCS&request=GetCapabilities 

 
The corresponding minimum request encoded in XML is: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<GetCapabilities xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1 
../wcsGetCapabilities.xsd"  
service="WCS"/> 
 

In response to such a GetCapabilities request, the WCS server might generate a document 
that looks like the examples given in Subclause C.2: a top-level Capabilities element with all 
four child elements present – ServiceIdentification, ServiceProvider, OperationsMetadata, 
and Contents. 

Next is a more detailed GetCapabilities operation request, requesting just the Contents 
section – first in KVP encoding: 

http://hostname:port/path? 
Service=WCS&request=GetCapabilities& 
updateSequence=XYZ123& 
AcceptVersions=1.1.1,1.0.0& 
Sections=Contents& 
AcceptFormats=text/xml 
 

And in XML: 



OGC 07-067r2 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  21 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<GetCapabilities xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1"  
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1 
../wcsGetCapabilities.xsd"  
service="WCS" updateSequence="XYZ123"> 
 <ows:AcceptVersions> 
  <ows:Version>1.0.0</ows:Version> 
  <ows:Version>1.1.1</ows:Version> 
 </ows:AcceptVersions> 
 <ows:Sections> 
  <ows:Section>Contents</ows:Section> 
 </ows:Sections> 
 <ows:AcceptFormats> 
  <ows:OutputFormat>text/xml</ows:OutputFormat> 
 </ows:AcceptFormats> 
</GetCapabilities> 

 
The response to such a request would be an XML file with a top-level Capabilities element – 
as illustrated in Subclause C.2, but with ONLY the Contents section (omitting 
ServiceIdentification, ServiceProvider, and OperationsMetadata). 

9 DescribeCoverage operation (mandatory) 

9.1 Introduction 

Once a client has obtained summary descriptions of a WCS server’s available coverages, it 
may be able to make simple GetCoverage requests. However, in most cases the client will 
need to issue a DescribeCoverage request to obtain a full description of one or more 
coverages available. The server responds to such a request with an XML document 
describing one or more coverages served by that WCS. Each WCS server shall implement the 
DescribeCoverage operation. 

9.2 DescribeCoverage operation request 

9.2.1 DescribeCoverage request parameters 

A DescribeCoverage operation request lists one or more coverages to be described, each 
identified by an identifier parameter. A request to perform the DescribeCoverage operation 
shall use the data structure shown in the UML diagram in Figure 5. The attributes of the new 
class shall include the parameters listed and defined in Table 7.

See Subclause 8.3.3.1. 

 
The “Multiplicity and use” column in Table 7 specifies the optionality of each listed 
parameter in the DescribeCoverage operation request. All parameters in the operation request 
are mandatory. That is, WCS clients shall implement all parameters, using the specified 



OGC 07-067r2

values, and WCS servers shall accept all parameters of the DescribeCoverage operation 
request, checking that each parameter contains the specified value. 

9.2.2 DescribeCoverage request KVP encoding 

WCS servers may implement KVP encoding for HTTP GET transfer of DescribeCoverage 
operation requests. Table 10 below specifies the DescribeCoverage request in KVP encoded 
form.

9.2.3 DescribeCoverage request XML encoding 

WCS servers may implement XML encoding for HTTP POST transfer of DescribeCoverage 
operation requests. The schema fragment that specifies the contents and structure of a 
DescribeCoverage operation request encoded in XML shall be as specified in the early part 
of the attached wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd file 

9.2.4 DescribeCoverage request SOAP encoding 

WCS servers may implement SOAP version 1.2 transfer of the DescribeCoverage operation 
request as specified in Annex E, using the XML encoding referenced above. 

9.3 DescribeCoverage operation response 

9.3.1 Normal response parameters 

9.3.1.1 Coverage descriptions 

The normal response to a valid DescribeCoverage operation request shall describe each 
coverage requested. More precisely, the response from a DescribeCoverage operation shall 
use the CoverageDescriptions data structure shown in the UML diagram in Figure 6, which 
uses the Domain and Range data structures shown in the UML diagrams in Figure 7 through 
Figure 9. The attributes and associations of the new classes shall include the parameters and 
data structures listed and defined in Table 9 through Table 19.

b The first bounding box shall exactly specify the spatial domain of the (one offered) CRS of the offered coverage, thus specifying 
the available grid row and column indices. For a georectified coverage (that has a GridCRS), this bounding box shall specify the spatial 
domain in that GridCRS. For an image that is not georectified, this bounding box shall specify the spatial domain in the ImageCRS of 
that image, whether or not that image is georeferenced. 
Additional bounding boxes, if any, shall specify the spatial domain in other CRSs. These additional bounding boxes may be 
approximate, but should be as accurate as practical. One bounding box could simply duplicate the information in the 
ows:WGS84BoundingBox in the CoverageSummary; but the intent is to describe the spatial domain in more detail (e.g., in several 
different CRSs, or several rectangular areas instead of one overall bounding box). Multiple bounding boxes with the same CRS shall be 
interpreted as an unordered list of bounding boxes whose union covers spatial domain of this coverage. WCS use of this BoundingBox 
is further specified in specification Subclause 7.6. 
c This GridCRS shall be included in the SpatialDomain when the offered coverage is georectified and thus has a GridCRS.  This 
GridCRS applies to this offered coverage, and specifies its spatial resolution. 
d This CoordinateOperation can be a Transformation or a ConcatenatedOperation that includes at least one Transformation. 
e A Transformation that is a georeferencing coordinate transformation for an unrectified offered coverage should be included in the 
SpatialDomain when available and the coverage is georeferenced but not georectified. When included, this Transformation will specify 
the variable spatial resolution of this non-georectified image. To support use cases 4, 5, 9, or 10 specified in Annex G, a WCS server 
needs to use a georeferencing coordinate transformation for a coverage that is georeferenced but not georectified. However, a WCS 
server may opt not to support those use cases, or to use other means (such as a linked metadata file) to convey the georeferencing 
transformation, or not to make that transformation available to clients at all. Conversely, a client may opt to ignore any Transformation 
and to treat such a coverage as a non-georeferenced coverage (or to obtain the transformation by some other means). 
f The imageCRS shall be referenced in the SpatialDomain when the coverage is an image.  This imageCRS applies to this offered 
coverage, but does not (normally) specify its spatial resolution. 
g Polygons are particularly useful for areas that are poorly approximated by an ows:BoundingBox (such as satellite image swaths, 
island groups, other non-convex areas).

9.3.2 Supporting information 

9.3.2.1 Scalar and vector fields 

The fields in a coverage range record may be scalar-valued or vector-valued. A scalar-valued 
field associates a single number (or other “atomic” value) to each location in the domain.  

EXAMPLE 1 A scalar-valued field would be useful for terrain elevation or panchromatic (full-spectrum) 
brightness of a landscape. 

A vector-valued field in a coverage range conveys multiple identically defined observations 
(measuring the same phenomenon and expressing it in same reference system) at each 
location, recorded for different values (“keys”) of one or more control variables (“axes”). 
Clients may request subsets of such a field by selecting a subset of these keys.  

EXAMPLE 2 The range of a hyperspectral image coverage would usually have a single vector-valued field, 
representing brightness values at different points along the electromagnetic spectrum. The axis of such a field 
would be the set of spectral bands, or the wavelengths, for which a sensor has recorded brightness values. A 
client might retrieve the near-infrared portions of a hyperspectral image by requesting only certain keys on an 
axis named “wavelength.” 

For a vector field, the Axis data structure describes the nature of each control variable, and 
indicates (as Keys) the constraint values available for selecting field subsets. The Key values 
shall be textual names, which can be numbers encoded as character strings. The axes of a 
field span a multi-dimensional array of values, as depicted in Figure 10 below.  

 

Figure 10 — Example vector fields 

Figure 10 shows two example vector fields, one with two axes, and the other with one axis. 
These define rectangular arrays: that is, for all Keys along each Axis, the corresponding 
"slices" through the array have the same size. 

NOTE 1 If a set of recorded observations has any semantic variation (including any differences in the 
measurement process or the reference system in which quantities are expressed), then the different observations 
belong in different fields or possibly different coverages. For instance, atmospheric pressure, water temperature, 



OGC 07-067r2 

34 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

and land ownership would require distinct fields in a coverage range. Distinct fields would also be needed for a 
multispectral image in which some bands represent emissive radiance, and others reflective radiance.  

NOTE 2 When a WCS service offers two sets of data for one area but with different spatial resolutions, then 
they need to be described as two separate coverages because they cannot share a common domain description. 

9.3.2.2 SupportedFormat 

The required SupportedFormat element(s) advertises an output format in which a coverage 
may be requested from a WCS server. Formats are identified by a MIME type string. Any 
coverage format that can adequately convey the domain and range of the requested coverage 
is acceptable. The following formats have been used to convey certain kinds of coverages: 

• GeoTIFF <http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/geotiff.html> 
• HDF-EOS <http://www.hdfeos.org> 
• NITF <http://www.ismc.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/1999.html> 
• CF-NetCDF <http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata> 

NOTE This specification deprecates the privileged status given to some of the above formats in WCS 1.0. 
The above formats are cited merely as examples, with no normative intent.  

However, for improved interoperability, clients and servers should use formats defined in 
WCS encoding profiles adopted by the OGC. These encoding profiles shall contain the 
following information: 

a) MIME type(s) and brief description: a concise overview of the encoding format, 
including the MIME type string(s) used to refer to it, the files required (e.g. header, 
dictionary, georeferencing, etc.), and the “role” values in the Xlink references in the 
GetCoverage response (see Subclauses 10.3.11.2 and I.3.2). 

b) Pointers to documentation for the encoding format. This documentation shall clarify how 
the encoding convention represents locations, times, and physical quantities represented 
in the dataset. 

c) Data model mapping to the Coverage Abstract Specification. This should include 
conventions for representing the spatio-temporal domain, and for representing the 
dimensions in the range. It should also describe limitations of the format for encoding 
complex coverages, and limitations of the coverage model for representing complex data 
structures encoded in the format. 

d) Metadata mapping and encoding. Mapping of the coverage metadata to the data 
format encoding's metadata representation, if any. This mapping may address as 
many of the GetCoverage response metadata items as expressible in the format. 

e) Examples: A set of examples of the encoding format, and of corresponding Coverages 
XML response documents (see Subclauses 10.3.11.2 and I.3). 

f) Pointers to implementing software for the encoding format. Providers of this software 
may license it in source code or executable form. 

g) Compliance Testing: Pointers to mechanisms for testing whether resulting WCS 
coverages conform to the encoding format. 



OGC 07-067r2 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  35 

The titles of these encoding profiles shall follow the following pattern: 

WCS 1.1 Application Profile for [Format] [formatVersion] encoding, 
[profileVersion] 
 

EXAMPLE  WCS 1.1 Application Profile for GeoTIFF 6.0 encoding, 0.9 

9.3.2.3 Reserved characters in CoverageDescription parameter values 

The following CoverageDescription parameter values shall be usable literally (“as-is”) in 
subsequent GetCoverage operation requests to the originating server, encoded in KVP or 
XML: 

a)  “Identifier” parameter in CoverageDescription 

b) “SupportedFormat” parameter in CoverageDescription 

c) “Identifier” parameter in Field 

d) “InterpolationMethod” parameters in InterpolationMethods in Field 

e)  “Identifier” parameter in Axis 

f) “Key” parameters in AvailableKeys in Axis 

In stating values for these parameters, servers shall avoid, encode, or escape certain special 
characters, as detailed in Subclause 7.4, to avoid misinterpreting them as part of the XML or 
KVP syntax of subsequent requests.   

In addition, when the WCS server supports KVP GetCoverage requests, the identifiers for 
Field, Axis, Key, and InterpolationMethod shall be usable literally within a RangeSubset 
parameter (see 10.2.2.2 below). This requires avoiding, encoding, or escaping any characters 
(‘[’ ‘]‘ ‘:’ ‘;’ ‘,’) that are meaningful to the RangeSubset syntax. Servers may use any scheme 
for encoding or escaping these characters. 

NOTE The method for encoding or escaping special characters for RangeSubset is not specified. This is 
because clients will present the resulting identifier strings only to the originating server. 

9.3.2.4 Summary of ISO 8601 syntax for time positions and time periods 

The [ISO 8601:2000] syntax for dates and times may be summarized by the following 
template (see Annex D of the OGC Web Map Service [OGC 06-042]): 

ccyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ 

Where 

“ccyy-mm-dd” is the date (a four-digit year, and a two-digit month and day); 

“T” is a separator between the data and time strings; 

“hh:mm:ss.sss” is the time (a two-digit hour and minute, and fractional seconds); 

“Z” represents the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC or “zulu”) time zone.

ISO 8601:2000 allows (i) up to a 14-digit year, with a negative sign, to denote the distant 
past; (ii) omitting less-significant numbers in the template to reduce the precision of the date 
and time; and (iii) use of other time zones, denoted as in Subclause 5.3.4.1 of ISO 8601:2000. 
Here a few examples: 

EXAMPLE 1 2006 The year 2006 
EXAMPLE 2 2006-09 September 2006 
EXAMPLE 3 2006-09-27T10:00Z 10 o’clock (Universal Time) on 27 September, 2006 

ISO 8601:2000 also provides a syntax for expressing time periods: the designator P, followed 
by a number of years Y, months M, days D, a time designator T, number of hours H, minutes 
M, and seconds S. Unneeded elements may be omitted. Here are a few examples: 

EXAMPLE 4 P1Y 1 year 
EXAMPLE 5 P1M10D 1 month plus 10 days 
EXAMPLE 6 PT2H 2 hours 

The WCS GetCoverage KVP syntax (defined in 10.2.2) extends ISO 8601:2000 with a 
syntax for time lists and ranges, as specified in Annex D of [OGC 06-042]. Some examples 
follow: 

EXAMPLE 7 2000-06-23T20:07:48.11Z (A single moment) 
EXAMPLE 8 1999-01-01,1999-04-01,1999-07-01,1999-10-01 (A list of four dates) 
EXAMPLE 9 1995-04-22T12:00Z/2000-06-21T12:00Z/P1D  

(Daily (“P1D”) between 12 noon on April 22 1995 and 12 noon on June 21, 2000) 

9.3.3 Normal response XML encoding 

The XML Schema fragment that specifies the contents and structure of a DescribeCoverage 
operation response shall be as specified in the latter part of the attached 
wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd file. 

9.3.4 Normal response SOAP encoding 

WCS servers that implement SOAP version 1.2 transfer of DescribeCoverage operation 
requests shall also implement SOAP transfer of the corresponding GetCoverage operation 
responses. These operation responses shall be encoded as specified in Annex E, using the 
XML encoding referenced above. 

9.4 DescribeCoverage exceptions 

When a WCS server encounters an error while performing a DescribeCoverage operation, it 
shall return an exception report message as specified in Subclause 7.4 of [OGC 06-121r3]. 
The allowed standard exception codes shall include those listed in Table 20. For each listed 
exceptionCode, the contents of the “locator” parameter value shall be as specified in the right 
column of Table 20.

9.5 DescribeCoverage operation examples 

The following example requests a description of a single coverage – first in KVP: 

http://server_address/path/script?service=WCS 
&request=DescribeCoverage&version=1.1.1 
&identifiers=SPVIEW_530_274 

And in XML: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<DescribeCoverage xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1" 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1 
../wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd"  
service="WCS" version="1.1.1"> 
 <Identifier>SPVIEW_530_274</Identifier> 
</DescribeCoverage> 

 
In response to such a request, the WCS server might generate a document like the following: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<CoverageDescriptions xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"

Clients may request descriptions of several coverages at once, in KVP:  

http://server_address/path/script?service=WCS 
&request=DescribeCoverage&version=1.1.0 
&identifiers=Cov1,Cov2,Cov3 

Or equivalently, in XML: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<DescribeCoverage xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

service="WCS" version="1.1.1"> 
 <Identifier>Landsat_TM_Mosaic</Identifier> 
 <Identifier>WMO_Daily_Temps</Identifier> 
 <Identifier>Census_population_tables</Identifier> 
</DescribeCoverage> 
 

The corresponding response would have multiple CoverageDescription elements under the 
top-level CoverageDescriptions. 

10 GetCoverage operation (mandatory) 

10.1 Introduction 

The mandatory GetCoverage operation allows retrieval of subsets of coverages. A WCS 
server processes a GetCoverage operation request and returns a response to the client that 
either contains or references the requested coverage(s). The GetCoverage operation shall be 
implemented by all WCS servers and clients.

b Axis identifier shall be an Axis listed for the requested coverage field in the DescribeCoverage operation response. 
c Keys shall be ones listed for this Axis of this Field in the CoverageDescription.  
d To request field values for all keys on an Axis, omit the Axis from the FieldSubset. 

 
The range subset of the output coverage shall be a set of fields taken from the range fields of 
the requested coverage. Each range field shall occur at most once in the RangeSubset list of 
Fields. Each Field data structure selects a field from the original coverage, optionally selects 
components of this field, and optionally chooses an interpolation method to be used for this 
field (and all of its components, if any). 

The InterpolationType parameter selects, for each range field, the interpolation method to be 
applied (if needed) in resampling operations. The InterpolationType value shall be one of 
those listed for the requested coverage Field in the DescribeCoverage operation response. 
One and the same interpolation method shall be used by a server for all values in a given 
(scalar or vector) Field. However, different Fields may employ different interpolation 
methods. When the GetCoverage request specifies no interpolation method for a Field, then 
the server shall apply the default interpolation method listed in the coverage's 
CoverageDescription. 

For a vector field, each AxisSubset data structure shall consist of a nonempty subset of the 
Keys defined for this Axis. Each AxisSubset selects subsets of this field constrained by the 
given set of Keys. When an Axis Subset is absent, the Field Subset shall be unconstrained 
along that Axis, with its values delivered in the Axis and Key sequence given in the 
CoverageDescription. Thus, when no AxisSubset is present for a vector field, the entire field 
shall be delivered. 

NOTE 2 Subclause 10.3.6 details the effect of the RangeSubset parameter on the result coverage. 

10.2.1.3  Implementation requirements 

The “Multiplicity and use” columns in Table 21 through Table 26 specify the optionality of 
each listed parameter and data structure in the GetCoverage operation request. All the 
“mandatory” parameters and data structures shall be implemented by all WCS clients, using a 
specified value(s). Similarly, all the “mandatory” parameters and data structures shall be 
implemented by all WCS servers, checking that each request parameter or data structure is 
received with any specified value(s). 

Implementation of the “store” parameter in the GetCoverage operation request is optional for 
both clients and servers. When a WCS server that does not implement the “store” parameter 
receives the “store” parameter with the “False” value, it shall not send an exception report 
message and shall not store the result coverage. When a WCS server that does not implement 



OGC 07-067r2 

44 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

the “store” parameter receives the “store” parameter with the “True” value, it shall return an 
exception report message with the InvalidParameterValue value of the exceptionCode and 
“store” as the value of the “locator”. Whether or not a WCS server implements the “store” 
parameter shall be specified in the OperationsMetadata section of the Capabilities document, 
as specified in Subclause 8.3.2 above. 

All WCS servers shall, and all WCS clients should, implement the other “optional” 
parameters and data structures in the GetCoverage operation request, where appropriate. 

10.2.2 GetCoverage request KVP encoding 

10.2.2.1  Overview 

WCS servers may use KVP encoding for HTTP GET transfer of GetCoverage operation 
requests. The KVP encoding of the GetCoverage operation request shall be as specified in 
Table 27. The parameters listed in Table 27 shall be as specified in Table 21 through Table 
26 above.

f This GridOrigin may be omitted when the GridBaseCRS is 2D, in which case the default value shall be “0.0 0.0”. 
g When the GridType is “urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs”, there shall be four values in this GridOffsets. The center 
two of these offsets will be zero when the GridCRS is not rotated or skewed in the GridBaseCRS. 
h These GridCRS parameters, except for defaulted parameters, shall be included to request output in a CRS other than the 
ImageCRS or GridCRS of the offered coverage. To request no interpolation, these parameters should be omitted. 

 
10.2.2.2  RangeSubset KVP syntax 

The syntax of the KVP RangeSubset parameter shall conform to the following grammar 
(using EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) notation [IETF RFC 2396]): 

 RangeSubset = FieldSubset *( “;” FieldSubset ) 
 FieldSubset = FieldId [ “:” Interpolation ] [ “[” AxisSubsets “]” ] 
 AxisSubsets = AxisSubset *( “,” AxisSubset ) 
 AxisSubset = AxisId “[” Keys “]”  
 Keys = Key *( “,” Key ) 
 FieldId = <field identifier, as defined in Subclause 9.3.1.3 and Table 17> 
 AxisId = <axis identifier, as defined in Subclause 9.3.1.3 and Table 18> 
 Key = <key, as defined in Subclause 9.3.1.3 and Table 19> 
 Interpolation = <interpolation type identifier, as defined in Table I.7> 
 
NOTE No extra whitespace is allowed in a RangeSubset string – any whitespace is always considered part 
of an adjacent identifier. 

EXAMPLES 
 rangeSubset=radiance;temperature 
 rangeSubset=radiance:linear;temperature:nearest 
 rangeSubset=radiance:linear[wavelengths[L1,L2],forecastTimes[T1];‌tem

perature:nearest[forecastTimes[T1]] 
 
When the WCS server supports KVP GetCoverage requests, the identifiers for FieldID, 
AxisID, Key, and InterpolationMethod given in the CoverageDescription shall be used 
literally (“as-is”) in the RangeSubset parameter, with no additional character encoding or 
escaping. (See 9.3.2.3 above.) 

10.2.3 GetCoverage request XML encoding 

WCS servers may implement XML encoding for HTTP Post transfer of GetCoverage 
operation requests. The XML Schema fragment for the GetCoverage operation request shall 
be as specified in the attached wcsGetCoverage.xsd file. 

10.2.4 GetCoverage request SOAP encoding 

WCS servers may implement SOAP version 1.2 transfer of the GetCoverage operation 
request as specified in Annex E, using the XML encoding referenced above.

10.3 GetCoverage operation response 

10.3.1 Introduction 

The normal response to a valid GetCoverage operation request shall be a single coverage 
extracted from the coverage requested, with the specified spatial reference system, bounding 
box, size, format, and range subset.  

10.3.2 GetCoverage exceptions 

When a WCS server encounters an error while performing a GetCoverage operation, it shall 
return an exception report message as specified in Subclause 7.4 of [OGC 06-121r3]. The 
allowed standard exception codes shall include those listed in Table 28. For each listed 
exceptionCode, the contents of the “locator” parameter value shall be as specified in the right 
column of Table 28. 

NOTE  To reduce the need for readers to refer to other documents, the first three values listed below are 
copied from Table 25 in Subclause 8.3 of [OGC 06-121r3].

10.3.3 Coverage processing 

The WCS GetCoverage request invokes some or all of a set of six basic operations: 

a) domain subsetting 

b) range subsetting 

c) resampling 

d) data format encoding 

e) result file delivery

Processing a GetCoverage request can conceptually be understood as executing the operation 
sequence shown in Figure 13. Depending on the particular request, some steps may be 
skipped. While a concrete implementation may choose a different evaluation strategy it shall 
ensure that the result is identical to the one achieved by the sequence depicted in Figure 13.

spatial scaling, into target CRS using resampling

Figure 13 — Conceptual GetCoverage request evaluation sequence 

10.3.4 Output coverage CRS 

Each output coverage from a GetCoverage operation shall be in the GridCRS that is specified 
in the Output data structure within the GetCoverage operation request, when such a GridCRS 
is specified there. When no GridCRS is included, the output coverage shall use the 
ImageCRS or GridCRS of the offered coverage, normally with the origin at a different grid 
point. The offered coverage will use a GridCRS when it is georectified, or an ImageCRS 
when it is an image that has not been georectified. An image that has not been georectified 
may be georeferenced or not. 

When included, this GridCRS specifies the desired grid for the output coverage, including the 
desired grid spacings, one of many possible origin locations, optional rotation, and optional 
skewing (angle between the axes) in a base CRS. However, this GridCRS is NOT required or 
expected to specify the actual position of the origin in the GetCoverage operation output. The 
position of the origin in the GetCoverage operation output shall be as directly or indirectly 
specified by the BoundingBox in the DomainSubset in the GetCoverage operation request. 

10.3.5 SupportedFormat and SupportedCRS dependencies 

Some formats require that the data be stored in a specific CRS, or the CRS must be chosen 
from a small list of CRSes. The dependency between CRSes and formats can not be 
expressed in this specification. When a WCS server receives a request where the requested 
output format and the requested output CRS are incompatible then the server shall return an 
UnsupportedCombination exception, see Table 28. 



OGC 07-067r2

10.3.6 Output coverage spatial extent 

The spatial extent of each output coverage shall be a rectangle in the CRS of that output 
coverage, using null values for any grid points whose values cannot be interpolated (when 
allowed) from grid point values included in the offered coverage. The BoundingBox of this 
spatial extent shall be computed, in the CRS of that output coverage, from the DomainSubset 
BoundingBox in the GetCoverage operation request. The specified extent may be skewed 
with curved edges in the desired output coverage CRS, although it is rectangular in the CRS 
of the DomainSubset BoundingBox. This will usually occur when a GridCRS is defined as 
the output coverage CRS, and this GridCRS (not the baseCRS of this GridCRS) is different 
from the CRS used in the DomainSubset BoundingBox. Such a skewed and curved extent in 
the desired resampled output coverage shall be interpreted as the minimum extent desired. 

NOTE 1 WCS use of BoundingBoxes is further specified in specification Subclause 7.6. 

When the specified extent is skewed/curved in the desired output coverage CRS, the server 
shall extend this extent to the minimum rectangle surrounding that skewed/curved extent. 
And the server shall extend this minimum rectangle to the next grid point rows and columns 
in the output coverage GridCRS or ImageCRS. 

NOTE 2 Computing the minimum surrounding rectangle may be done by considering a polygon with vertices 
at the four corner points of the specified bounding box and at least the center points in each side of that bounding 
box. The positions of these eight or more polygon vertices may be transformed from the CRS of the 
DomainSubset BoundingBox to the desired output coverage GridCRS (not the baseCRS of this GridCRS). The 
minimum rectangle surrounding all these polygon vertex positions can then be computed, followed by extending 
each side to the next row or column of grid point positions. 

The transformed and squared-off extent will often be skewed with curved edges in the 
georectified offered coverage, although it is rectangular in the output coverage CRS. When 
the transformed skewed/curved extent does not lie wholly within the offered coverage, 
padding with null values shall be applied to all output grid points falling outside the offered 
coverage. 

10.3.7 Output coverage temporal extent 

The temporal extent of the output coverage shall be the time instance(s) or period(s) 
requested in the GetCoverage request. For a particular time instance or interval, when the 
server cannot supply coverage values, it shall substitute null values. When the GetCoverage 
request specifies no temporal subset, then the returned coverage shall return values for all 
times in the domain of the requested Coverage. 

NOTE  The WCS currently does not allow interpolation of coverage values along the time dimension. 

10.3.8 Output coverage range 

The range of a result coverage is controlled by the RangeSubset data structure. The output 
coverage range shall consist of all and only the fields specified in the RangeSubset of the 
GetCoverage request, ordered as they appear there. When the GetCoverage request has no 
RangeSubset data structure, the result coverage range shall contain all fields of the original 
coverage, in the sequence defined in the CoverageDescription, and with the default 
interpolation method(s) applied whenever interpolation is required. 



OGC 07-067r2 

50 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

In the case of a vector field, the output coverage field shall be limited to the values 
corresponding to keys in the AxisSubset structure in the GetCoverage FieldSubset. The 
absence of an AxisSubset on a FieldSubset shall be equivalent to requesting field values for 
all keys of that Axis. (Thus, the absence of any AxisSubset at all for a field shall be 
equivalent to requesting the field in its entirety.) 

The InterpolationType parameter selects, for each range field, the interpolation method to be 
applied whenever spatial interpolation is used during resampling. A server shall use the same 
interpolation method for all values in a field. However, it may use different interpolation 
methods for different fields. When the getCoverage request does not specify an interpolation 
method for a field, then the server shall apply the default interpolation method listed for that 
field in the CoverageDescription. 

EXAMPLE 1 Assume a coverage with two fields, radiance and temperature. radiance has two Axes, 
“waveLength” with three keys(“0.6”, “0.7”, and “0.9”) and “forecastTime” with four keys (“08:00”, “14:00”, 
“20:00”, “02:00”). The field temperature has the Axis “forecastTimes”, with keys “06:00”, “12:00”, “18:00”, 
“00:00”. Both fields are assumed to support interpolation methods “linear” and “cubic”. Then, the following 
RangeSubset clause selects radiance at waveLength keys 0.6 and 0.9 and forecastTime keys 08:00 and 14:00, and 
temperature at all forecast times. When spatial interpolation is needed, it requests linear interpolation for radiance 
and the (server-defined) default interpolation method for temperature. 

RangeSubset=radiance:linear[waveLength[0.6,0.9],forecastTime[08:00,14:00]];‌tempe
rature 

10.3.9 Output coverage metadata 

The metadata listed in Table 29, or the equivalent information, shall be included with each 
WCS output coverage. Equivalent metadata may be encoded with the coverage data in some 
possible coverage formats, as specified by a WCS Application Profile document (see 9.3.2.2 
above). Such metadata may be XML encoded using the XML data type listed in Table 29. A 
WCS Application Profile document may specify encoding equivalent metadata both within a 
specialized coverage format and outside that format, but such duplication is discouraged to 
avoid consistency issues. When any metadata is encoded both with and outside the coverage 
data, that duplicated metadata shall be as consistent as possible.

10.3.10 Output coverage formats 

A WCS server shall serve coverages in any of the formats listed as a SupportedFormat for the 
requested coverage (see 9.3.2.2 above). For most possible formats, more information is 
required to specify how a WCS output coverage shall (or can) be encoded using that format. 
That specific information should be specified in a WCS Application Profile document (see 
9.3.2.2 above). 

NOTE Encoding may reduce the coverage’s range accuracy when the format chosen does not support the 
coverage’s accuracy in terms of range types. For example, GIF can only represent 256 color values, hence a GIF 
converter will approximate colors while determining a best-match color map. Encoding a result coverage in 
JPEG (with quality less than 1.0) will incur range value approximation. In all of these cases the pixels’ 
radiometry will be inaccurate. 

Regardless of the coverage format, the GetCoverage response shall be encoded as a 
Coverages XML document that references one or more files, which may be bundled with it or 
accessible separately via URL(s), as detailed in 10.3.11 below. 

10.3.11 Response encodings 

10.3.11.1 Overview 

The encoding of the GetCoverage response consists of a Coverages XML document (see 
10.3.11.2 below), packaged and bundled according to the request encoding and the value of 
the “store” parameter (see Table 23). WCS servers shall implement response encodings 
according to Table 30. 

Table 30 — GetCoverage response encodings 

Request 
encoding store=true

 a store=false (default) 

KVP or 
XML 

Coverages alone 
(see 10.3.11.2) 

Coverages in a MIME Multipart 
message 
(see 10.3.11.3) 

SOAP 
Coverages alone in a SOAP 

envelope 
(see 10.3.11.4) 

Coverages in a SOAP envelope 
with Attachments 
(see 10.3.11.5) 

a Applies only when the server supports the “store” parameter (see Subclause 8.3.2.3). 
 
If the “store” parameter has the value “true”, the server shall store the result file(s) at URL-
addressable location(s) of its choosing, and return only the Coverages data structure (within a 
SOAP envelope in the case of a SOAP request) with references to the other files as indicated 
in 10.3.11.2 and 10.3.11.4 below. 

When the “store” parameter is absent or has the value “false”, the server shall transfer the 
complete GetCoverage response to the client, either as a MIME multipart message (for KVP 
or XML requests) or as a SOAP message with attachments (for SOAP requests). The 
Coverages shall reference the other parts of the MIME multi-part message (or SOAP 
attachments) as indicated in 10.3.11.3 below. 



OGC 07-067r2 

52 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

10.3.11.2 Coverages data structure 

The GetCoverage operation response shall be XML encoded using the Coverages data 
structure specified in Annex H.2. This Coverages data structure allows the response to 
reference multiple files, and shall be output even when the GetCoverage operation response 
would otherwise contain only one file. 

As shown in the UML diagram in Figure I.2, this Coverages object contains one or more 
Coverage reference group objects, each of which includes one or more Reference elements. 
A Coverages class in a GetCoverage operation response shall reference all the data files for 
one output coverage, including the coverage values and any associated metadata. 

EXAMPLE  An example XML document using the Coverages element is: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<Coverages xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
 xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows"  
 xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"  
 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
 xmlns:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1

../../../ows/1.1.0/owsAll.xsd">

  <Reference xlink:href="http://my.server.com/coverage/metadata.xml" 
xlink:role="urn:ogc:def:role:WCS:1.1:metadata"/> 
 </Coverage> 
</Coverages> 
 
 

NOTE The URN values used for Reference “role” attributes are to be specified in encoding profiles. 

10.3.11.3 MIME multipart response 

GetCoverage responses transferred using MIME multipart shall be encoded according to 
[IETF RFC 2387], with the first part containing an XML encoded Coverages element. Every 
part of the multipart message shall have a content-id. The part containing the Coverages 
element shall have a content-id equal to “urn:ogc:wcs:1.1:coverages”; other parts may have 
any content-id values. The Coverages element shall reference other parts of the multipart 
message by their content-id values, prefixed by “cid:”. 

EXAMPLE 1 If a multipart message contains a part with “content-id:ottawa_temp.tiff”, then the 
Coverage element would reference that part with the following XML fragment: 

<Reference xlink:href="cid:ottawa_temp.tiff"/> 

NOTE Using prefixes other than “cid:”, the Coverages element can (but normally should not) reference 
resources external to the MIME multipart message. 



OGC 07-067r2 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  53 

10.3.11.4  SOAP response 

WCS servers that implement SOAP transfer of GetCoverage operation requests shall also 
implement SOAP version 1.2 transfer of the corresponding GetCoverage operation 
responses. These operation responses shall be encoded as specified in Annex E. When the 
“store” parameter has the value “true”, the body of the SOAP envelope shall contain one 
XML encoded Coverages element with one or more references to URLs of files containing 
coverage content and metadata. 

10.3.11.5  SOAP with Attachments response 

When the “store” parameter is absent or has the value “false”, responses to GetCoverage 
SOAP requests shall be encoded as SOAP with Attachments as defined in [W3C Note] (but 
using SOAP 1.2 rather than SOAP 1.1). These responses shall consist of MIME multipart 
messages, as specified in 10.3.11.3, with the Coverages element contained within a SOAP 
1.2 envelope, encoded as specified in Annex E. 

10.3.12 Coverages XML encoding 

Application Profiles should be written for all formats, as specified in Subclause 9.3.2.2. 
These Profiles shall specify how any of the coverage metadata specified in Subclause 10.3.9 
shall be included in the same file as the coverage grid values. XML encoding is not expected 
to be used for the coverage grid values part of that file. 

For each coverage, XML encoding should be used for the required coverage metadata 
specified in Subclause 10.3.9, when not included in the same file as the coverage grid values. 
It is also possible for an Application Profile to specify use of XML encoding for some of the 
metadata that is included in the same file as the coverage grid values. When XML encoding 
is used in the same file, the XML encoding referenced in Subclause 10.3.9 shall be used. 

EXAMPLE  The GML in JPEG 2000 encoding specification [OGC 05-047r3] could be adapted to encode 
both coverage grid values and associated metadata. 

10.4 GetCoverage operation examples 

10.4.1 A minimal GetCoverage request 

A client might issue the following GetCoverage operation request with minimum contents – 
encoded in KVP: 

 http://my.service.org/path/script? 
service=WCS 
&version=1.1.1 
&request=GetCoverage 
&identifier=Cov123 
&BoundingBox=-71,47,-66,51,urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:2:84 
&format=image/netcdf 

 
This corresponds to the following minimum request encoded in XML: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<GetCoverage xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1"  



OGC 07-067r2 

54 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1 
../wcsGetCoverage.xsd"  
service="WCS" version="1.1.1"> 
 <ows:Identifier>Cov123</ows:Identifier> 
 <DomainSubset> 
  <ows:BoundingBox crs="urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:2:84"> 
   <ows:LowerCorner>-71 47</ows:LowerCorner> 
   <ows:UpperCorner>-66 51</ows:UpperCorner> 
  </ows:BoundingBox> 
 </DomainSubset> 
 <Output format="image/netcdf"/> 
</GetCoverage> 
 

This would request the portion of coverage “Cov123” falling within the given longitude and 
latitude bounds, with output encoded according to the “image/netcdf” convention for WCS 
(as specified in a separate profile). This request omits the following parameters: 

a) TimeSequence (thus requesting coverage values for all available times) 

b) RangeSubset (thus requesting all fields of “Cov123” in their entirety); 

c) Output CRS parameters: GridBaseCRS, GridType, GridCS, GridOrigin, GridOffsets. 
This requests output expressed in the CRS of the offered coverage “Cov123”. 

d) Store (thus requesting the coverage in-line rather than posted to a URL) 

10.4.2 A longer GetCoverage request 

The following adds a simple range subset and a simple 2D output GridCRS to the previous 
example. It also asks the server to store the result rather than deliver it inline: 

http://my.service.org/path/script? 
service=WCS&version=1.1.1&request=GetCoverage 
&identifier=Cov123&format=image/netcdf 
&BoundingBox=-71,47,-66,51,urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:2:84 
&RangeSubset=radiance[waveLength[0.6,0.9]];temperature:cubic 
&GridBaseCRS=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:32618 
&GridOffsets=10,10 
&store=true 

 
The above KVP request is identical to the previous one except that it requests  

a) a subset of the coverage range (only radiance for wavelength values 0.6 and 0.9, with the 
default spatial interpolation for this field; and temperature with bicubic interpolation); 

b) an output grid with 10x10 meter pixels aligned with the northing/easting axes of WGS 84 
UTM meters, Zone 18 north (EPSG 32618). 

This corresponds to the following XML request: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<GetCoverage xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1"

   <GridCS>urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS</GridCS> 
  </GridCRS> 
 </Output> 
</GetCoverage> 
 

The request (whether in KVP or XML) implicitly uses default values for the following 
GridCRS parameters: 

a) GridType: default is “urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dSimpleGrid” 
(This GridType disallows rotation or skew relative to the GridBaseCRS – therefore 
GridOffsets has only two numbers.) 

b) GridCS: default is “urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS” 

c) GridOrigin: default is “0,0” (KVP) or “0 0” (XML). 

10.4.3 Another GetCoverage request 

The following request adds a time constraint and non-default gridCRS parameters for the 
output coverage. 

http://my.service.org/path/script? 
service=WCS&version=1.1.1&request=GetCoverage 
&identifier=Cov123&format=image/netcdf 
&TimeSequence=2006-08-01/2006-09-01/P1D 
&GridBaseCRS=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:32618 
&GridType=urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridin2dCrs 
&GridCS=urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS 
&GridOrigin=3000,4000 
&GridOffsets=8.0,6.0,-6.0,8.0 
 

The TimeSequence KVP parameter provides the time constraint: daily (“P1D”) between Aug. 
1 and Sept. 1, 2006, inclusive. As before, the requested output grid is defined relative to 
WGS 84 UTM meters, Zone 18 North (EPSG 32618) – but rotated relative to the 
northing/easting lines: the two pairs of offsets in GridOffsets form 3-4-5 right triangles, for a 



OGC 07-067r2 

56 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

10x10 meter grid spacing and a counter-clockwise rotation of about 37 degrees. The output 
grid has its origin at (3000,4000) rather than (0,0). 

This corresponds to the following XML request: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Annex A 
(normative) 

 
Conformance 

Specific conformance tests for a Web Coverage Service will be added in a future revision of 
this specification. At the moment, a WCS implementation must satisfy the following system 
characteristics to be minimally conformant with this specification: 

a) WCS Clients and servers must support the GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage, and 
GetCoverage operations. 

b) WCS clients must issue GetCapabilities requests in Key-Value Pair (KVP), XML, or 
SOAP form. GetCapabilities KVP requests must conform to Subclause 8.2.2. 
GetCapabilities XML requests must conform to Subclause 8.2.3, and must be valid 
against the XML Schema definition in wcsGetCapabilities.xsd. GetCapabilities SOAP 
requests must conform to Subclause 8.2.4. 

c) WCS servers must respond to a GetCapabilities KVP or XML request with an XML 
document that conforms to Subclause 8.3, and is valid against the XML Schema 
definition in wcsGetCapabilities.xsd and wcsContents.xsd. The response to a 
GetCapabilities SOAP request shall encapsulate this XML document in the body of a 
SOAP envelope, as specified in Annex E. 

d) WCS clients must issue DescribeCoverage requests in Key-Value Pair (KVP) or XML 
form. DescribeCoverage KVP requests must conform to Subclause 9.2.2. 
DescribeCoverage XML requests must conform to Subclause 9.2.3, and must be valid 
against the XML Schema definition in wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd. DescribeCoverage 
SOAP requests must conform to Subclause 9.2.4. 

e) WCS servers must respond to a DescribeCoverage KVP or XML request with an XML 
document that conforms to Subclause 9.3, and is valid against the XML Schema 
definition in wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd. The response to a DescribeCoverage SOAP 
request shall encapsulate this XML document in the body of a SOAP envelope, as 
specified in Annex E. 

f) WCS clients must issue GetCoverage requests in Key-Value Pair (KVP) or XML form. 
GetCoverage KVP requests must conform to Subclause 10.2.2. GetCoverage XML 
requests must conform to Subclause 10.2.3, and must be valid against the XML Schema 
definition in wcsGetCoverage.xsd. GetCoverage SOAP requests must conform to 
Subclause 10.2.4. 

g) WCS servers must be able to respond to a GetCoverage KVP or XML operation with an 
XML document that conforms to Subclause 10.3.11. The response to a GetCoverage 
SOAP request shall encapsulate this XML document in the body of a SOAP envelope, as 
specified in Subclause 10.3.11 and Annex E.

Annex B 
(informative) 

 
WCS XML Schemas 

In addition to this document, this specification includes normative XML Schema Document 
files. The WCS-specific XML Schema Documents are posted online at the URL 
http://schemas.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1. These XML Schema Documents are also bundled with 
the present document. In the event of a discrepancy between the bundled and online versions 
of the XML Schema files, the online files shall be considered authoritative. 

The WCS abilities specified in this document use nine specified XML Schema Documents 
included in the zip file with this document, which are named: 

a) wcsGetCapabilities.xsd 
b) wcsDescribeCoverage.xsd 
c) wcsGetCoverage.xsd 
d) wcsContents.xsd 
e) wcsCommon.xsd 
f) wcsAll.xsd 
g) wcs:GridCRS.xsd (specified in Annex F) 
h) wcsCoverages.xsd (specified in Subclause I.2) 
i) wcsInterpolationMethod.xsd (specified in Subclause I.3) 

The wcsInterpolationMethod.xsd XML Schema Document references an XML document that 
specifies some values and meanings of the InterpolationType specified in Subclause I.4. That 
XML document is named interpolationMethods.xml, and is referenced at 
http://schemas.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.0/interpolationMethods.xml. 

These XML Schema Documents use and build on the OWS Common XML Schema 
Documents listed in Annex B of [OGC 06-121r3], specified in the “ows” namespace. 

All these XML Schemas contain documentation of the meaning of each element and 
attribute, and this documentation is considered normative as specified in Subclause 11.6.3 of 
[OGC 06-121r3].

Annex C 
(informative) 

 
XML document examples 

C.1 Introduction 

As an aid to understanding and a guide for implementation, this annex contains more 
example XML documents which are valid according to the XML schemas referenced in 
Annex B. 

C.2 GetCapabilities operation XML encoding examples 

To request a Capabilities document, a client could issue the following GetCapabilities 
minimal operation request encoded as KVP: 

 http://hostname:port/path&service=WCS&request=GetCapabilities 
 
The corresponding minimum request encoded in XML is: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<GetCapabilities xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1 
../wcsGetCapabilities.xsd"  
service="WCS"/> 

 
In response to such a GetCapabilities operation request, a WCS server might generate a 
document that looks like the following: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<Capabilities xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wcs/1.1.1"  
xmlns:ows="http://www.opengis.net/ows/1.1"

         <ows:Abstract>This image was generated from digital data bases 
of seafloor and land elevations on a 2-minute latitude/longitude grid (1 
minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile, or 1.852 km). Assumed illumination 
is from the west; shading is computed as a function of the east-west 
slope of the surface with a nonlinear exaggeration favoring low-relief 
areas. A Cylindrical Equidistant projection was used for the world 
image, which spans 360 degrees of of longitude from 180 West eastward to 
180 East; latitude coverage is from 90 degrees North to 90 degrees 
South. The resolution of the gridded data varies from true 2-minute for 
the Atlantic, Pacific, andIndian Ocean floors and all land masses to 5

Annex D 
(informative) 

 
UML model 

D.1 Introduction 

This annex provides a UML model of the WCS interface, using the OGC/ISO profile of 
UML summarized in Subclause 5.2 of the OWS Common [OGC 06-121r3]. 

Figure D.1 is a UML diagram summarizing the WCS interface. This class diagram shows that 
the WebCoverageService class inherits the getCapabilities operation from the abstract 
OGCWebService class, which is common to all OGC Web Services. The 
WebCoverageService class adds the getCoverage and describeCoverage operations. (The 
capitalization of class, operation, and data type names uses the OGC/ISO profile of UML.) 

OGCWebService

+ getCapabilities(request : GetCapabilities) : ServiceMetadata

(from OWS Common)

<<Interface>>

Each server instance normally instantiates only one object of this 
class, and this object always exists while server is available.

WebCoverageServer

+ describeCoverage(request : DescribeCoverage) : CoverageDescriptions
+ getCoverage(request : GetCoverage) : Coverages

 

Figure D.1 — WCS interface UML class diagram 

Each of the three operations uses a request and a response data type, each of which is  
defined by one or more additional UML classes. The following subclauses provide a more 
complete UML model of the WCS interface, adding UML classes defining the operation 
request and response data types. 

D.2 UML packages 

The WCS interface UML model is organized in nine packages, as shown in the package 
diagram in Figure D.2. These nine WCS-specific packages make use of most OGC Web 
Service Common (OWS Common) packages, some ISO 19111 packages and the ISO 19108 
package. Only the packages used directly are shown, without listing the classes in the OWS

Annex E 
(normative) 

 
SOAP transfer 

All compliant WCS servers may implement SOAP 1.2 transfer of all WCS operation requests 
and responses, using the XML encodings specified in the body of this document. When 
SOAP is implemented, the SOAP Request-Response message exchange pattern shall be used 
with the HTTP POST binding. 

For SOAP transfer, each XML-encoded operation request shall be encapsulated in the body 
of a SOAP envelope, which shall contain only a body and only this request in that body. 
Similarly, each XML-encoded operation response shall be encapsulated in the body of a 
SOAP envelope, which shall contain only a body and only this response in that body. A WCS 
server shall return operation responses and error messages using only SOAP transfer when 
the operation request is sent using SOAP. 

All compliant WCS servers shall specify the URLs to which SOAP operation requests may 
be sent, within the OperationsMetadata section of a service metadata (Capabilities) XML 
document, as specified in Subclause 8.3.2.  

When an error is detected while processing an operation request encoded in a SOAP 
envelope, the WCS server shall generate a SOAP response message where the content of the 
Body element is a Fault element containing an ExceptionReport element. This shall be done 
using the following XML fragment:  

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope"> 
 <soap:Body> 
  <soap:Fault> 
   <soap:Code> 
    <soap:Value>soap:Server</soap:Value> 
   </soap:Code> 
   <soap:Reason> 
    <soap:Text>A server exception was encountered.<soap:Text> 
   </soap:Reason> 
   <soap:Detail> 
    <ows:ExceptionReport> 
     ... 
    </ows:ExceptionReport> 
   </soap:Detail> 
  </soap:Fault> 
 </soap:Body> 
</soap:Envelope> 

 
The Code element shall have the Value “soap:server” indicating that this is a server 
exception. The Reason element shall have the Text “Server exception was encountered.” This 
fixed string is used since the details of the exception shall be specified in the Detail element 
using an ows:ExceptionReport element as specified in OWS Common [OGC 06-121r3].

Annex F 
(normative) 

 
GridCRS 

F.1 Introduction 

This annex specifies a GridCRS data structure for encoding the definitions of rectangular 
grids defined within another CRS. This annex also specifies three instances of the 
gml:OperationMethod element that specify rectangular grids (more precisely, parallelogram 
grids in the other CRS). Such a gml:OperationMethod is referenced by the GridType that is 
included in the specified GridCRS data structure. 

NOTE  This GridCRS data structure is specified here because it is now only used in WCS. However, this 
GridCRS is likely to be useful in other OWS specifications as well, such as the draft Web Coordinate 
Transformation Service (WCTS) [OGC 05-013]. When or before this GridCRS is used elsewhere, the GridCRS 
specification in this annex should be moved into a separate OGC Implementation Specification. 

F.2 GridCRS 

F.2.1 GridCRS contents 

This subclause specifies a GridCRS data structure for encoding the definition of a rectangular 
grid that is specified within another CRS, called the GridBaseCRS. This GridCRS data 
structure is simplified from the DerivedCRS element that is defined in GML 3.1.1, to define 
such a rectangular grid in the GridBaseCRS. 

NOTE 1 The GridCRS XML element can be referenced remotely as the source or target CRS of a 
CoordinateOperation element. However, it is NOT defined by a GML Application Schema, because such a 
definition would be too complex for use in WCS. This GridCRS element is thus NOT in the gml:_CRS 
substitutionGroup, and so it cannot be included as the baseCRS of a DerivedCRS, or included in a GML 
dictionary. However, this GridCRS element does use a few parts of GML, which are included in the approved 
GML 3.1.1 CRS support profile [OGC 05-094r1]. 

The parameters contained in the GridCRS data structure are described in Figure F.1 and 
specified in Table F.1.

gml:VerticalCRS, as specified in the GML 3.1.1 common CRSs profile [OGC 05-095r1]. This GridBaseCRS can alternately be a 2D 
or 3D gml:ImageCRS or another wcs:GridCRS. The two axes of a gml:GeographicCRS are usually named geodetic latitude and 
geodetic longitude, with coordinates listed in that order and with both latitude and longitude values given in decimal degrees. The 
two axes of a gml:ProjectedCRS are often named Easting and Northing, not always in that order, with values often given in metres. 

 
In this GridCRS, the GridType remotely references one of several fixed XML documents that 
each specifies an OperationMethod object. There are many OperationMethod objects that 
might be referenced, three of which are specified in Subclause F.3. 

F.2.2 Default values 

As indicated above, the definition of a GridCRS contains five primary parts. However, two of 
these parts will often have the same values. Those same values will be the values needed for 
the most common case, namely a 2D grid defined in a 2D CRS, without grid rotation or 
skewing. Furthermore, when included in the output part of a GetCoverage operation request, 
a third part will often have the same value, namely a “0.0 0.0” origin position. Default values 
are thus specified for these three parts, to allow omission of specific values for these parts in 
the most common cases. These default values are as specified in Table F.2.

b This URN and its meaning are specified in Subclause 10.4 of OGC Best Practices Paper [OGC 05-096r1]. 
 
F.2.3 XML encoding 

The definition of a GridCRS will often be encoded in XML. This XML encoding shall use 
the XML Schema fragment specified in wcs:GridCRS.xsd. 

EXAMPLE 1 An example XML fragment defining a 2D GridCRS without grid rotation or skewing is: 
<GridCRS> 
 <gml:srsName>2D Grid CRS Example 1</gml:srsName> 
 <GridBaseCRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405</GridBaseCRS> 
 <GridType>urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs</GridType > 
 <GridOrigin>1.0 2.0</GridOrigin> 
 <GridOffsets>0.1 0 0 0.2</GridOffsets> 
 <GridCS>urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS</GridCS > 
</GridCRS> 

 
NOTE 1 In the above example, the center two Offsets values are zero because there is no grid rotation or 
skewing relative to the underlying CRS axes (meridians and parallels). These offset values define a grid with a 
point spacing of 0.1 x 0.2 degree (latitude x longitude, as defined by EPSG 63266405) 
EXAMPLE 2 An example XML fragment defining a 2D GridCRS with rotation (but no skewing) in the 
baseCRS is: 

<GridCRS> 
 <gml:srsName>2D Grid CRS Example 2</gml:srsName> 
 <GridBaseCRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:32618</GridBaseCRS > 
 <GridType>urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs</GridType> 
 <GridOrigin>1.0 2.0</GridOrigin> 
 <GridOffsets>0.0707 -0.0707 0.1414 0.1414</GridOffsets> 
 <GridCS>urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS</GridCS> 
</GridCRS> 

 
NOTE 2 In the above example, the center two Offsets values are non-zero because there is 45 degrees grid 
rotation clockwise relative to the easting/northing axes of the GridBaseCRS (WGS84 UTM meters, Zone 18N – 
denoted EPSG 32618). The grid defined by these offsets has a point spacing of 0.1x0.2 meter. 
NOTE 3 These two example XML fragments reference the fixed XML document that specifies the 
2dGridIn2dCrs given in Subclause F.3.2. 

F.2.4 KVP encoding 

This GridCRS may be KVP encoded in a GetCoverage operation request. That KVP 
encoding shall be as specified in Table F.3.

b This GridType may be omitted when the GridBaseCRS is 2D and the grid is not rotated or skewed in the GridBaseCRS, in 
which case the default value shall be “urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dSimpleGrid”. 

c This GridCS may be omitted when the GridBaseCRS is 2D (in a 2D or 3D GridBaseCRS), in which case the default value 
shall be “urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS”. 

d This GridOrigin may be omitted when the GridBaseCRS is 2D, in which case the default value shall be “0.0 0.0”. 
e When the GridType is “urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs”, there shall be four values in this GridOffsets. The 

center two of these offsets will be zero when the GridCRS is not rotated or skewed in the GridBaseCRS. 
 
NOTE 1 This KVP encoding does not include the srsName of the GridCRS, since KVP encoding is only used 
in the Output part of a GetCoverage operation request, and any GridCRS defined there is never referenced. 

EXAMPLE 1 Here is an example 2D GridCRS definition without grid rotation or skewing, defined using 
KVP encoding: 
 GridBaseCRS=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405& 
 GridType=urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dSimpleGrid& 
 GridCS=urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS& 
 GridOrigin=0,0& 
 GridOffsets=0.1,0.2& 
 
NOTE 2 This example and the next define a grid in the EPSG:63266405 CRS, that is, WGS84 latitude and 
longitude expressed in decimal degrees. The grid spacing is 0.1 degree of latitude and 0.2 degree of longitude. 

EXAMPLE 2 Here is the same example GridCRS definition, taking advantage of all three applicable defaults: 
 GridBaseCRS=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405& 
 GridOffsets=0.1,0.2& 

 
EXAMPLE 3 Here is an example 2D GridCRS with 45 degrees clockwise rotation (but no skewing) in the 
GridBaseCRS, defined using KVP encoding:

 GridType=urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs& 
 GridCS=urn:ogc:def:cs:OGC:0.0:Grid2dSquareCS& 
 GridOrigin=0,0 
 GridOffsets=0.0707,-0.0707,0.1414,0.1414& 

 
NOTE 3 This example and the next define a grid in the EPSG:32618 CRS, that is, WGS84 UTM Zone 18 
North easting and northing expressed in meters. The grid spacing is 0.1m (NW-SE) and 0.2m (SW-NE) 

EXAMPLE 4 Here is the same GridCRS definition, taking advantage of the two applicable defaults:

F.3 Operation methods for rectangular grids 

F.3.1 Introduction 

This subclause specifies instances of the gml:OperationMethod element that specify 
rectangular grids in a manner similar to the gml:RectifiedGrid element. As previously stated, 
such a gml:OperationMethod is expected to normally be used by the GridType that is used by 
the specified GridCRS element. However, neither these gml:OperationMethods nor the 
GridCRSs using them define the extent of the grid (e.g., by extending gml:Grid as 
gml:RectifiedGrid does). 

F.3.2 2D grid in 2D CRS (urn:ogc:def:method:WCS:1.1:2dGridIn2dCrs)

east / north meters in the British National Grid, and vertical meters relative to the Ordnance Survey Datum). The

NOTE  This 2D simple grid method uses a GridOffsets (KVP or XML) parameter containing only two 
values: the grid spacing along each of its axes, expressed in the units and the order given by the underlying CRS 
(in this case, degrees of latitude and longitude, in that order). Those two values correspond to the RESX and 
RESY parameters used in the GetCoverage request KVP encoding in WCS 1.0.

Annex G 
(informative) 

 
GetCoverage use cases 

G.1 Introduction 

This annex describes a set of use cases for WCS GetCoverage operation requests and 
responses, followed by descriptions of how this WCS version can be used to satisfy these use 
cases. These use cases were developed and used by the WCS 1.1 RWG, and consider 
requesting spatial subsets of grid coverages, but do not discuss temporal subsets.  

G.2 Use cases 

G.2.1 Overview 

These use cases are based on three conditions affecting what a server is required to do to 
respond to a GetCoverage operation request. These conditions may or may not be significant 
to the client. These three conditions are: 

a) Is resampling of the offered coverage needed? 

b) Is the offered coverage georectified or unrectified? 

c) Is the desired spatial subset extent defined in ground (or object) or image coordinates? 

These 10 use cases are summarized in Table G.1, assigning case numbers for all possible 
combinations of these three conditions.

a The extent cannot be defined in a ground CRS for an unrectified and un-georeferenced coverage. 
These use cases also apply when the georeferencing coordinate transformation(s) are not available to the 
server, cannot be used by the server, or are not needed to satisfy the GetCoverage request. 

 
In order to allow a client to not know anything more than whether it is defining the extent in 
a ground or image CRS, the GetCoverage request design for these use cases should use the

same request data structures for ALL supported use cases. For example, the GetCoverage 
request design should allow including either a ground or image CRS, of one subtype or 
another, in exactly the same places for ALL supported use cases. 

In all these use cases, the server is required to be able to output metadata with the coverage, 
where all georeferencing information included within an image file is considered to be 
metadata. 

The following subclauses further describe each use case. 

G.2.2 Use case 1: No resampling of georectified coverage, defining extent in ground CRS 

The GetCoverage request asks a server for an un-resampled subsection of a georectified 
image or other georectified grid coverage, defining the desired extent in a 2D ground CRS 
(GeographicCRS or ProjectedCRS). Notice that the specified extent could be skewed and 
with curved edges in the offered coverage. When such a skewed/curved extent is allowed in 
the offered coverage, the WCS server should interpret this extent as the minimum extent 
desired, and should extend that extent to the minimum rectangle surrounding that desired 
skewed/curved extent. 

The needed response from the GetCoverage operation includes all: 

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values 

b) CRS of output coverage 

c) Extent of output coverage 

G.2.3 Use case 2: No resampling of georectified image, defining extent in image CRS 

The GetCoverage request asks a server for an un-resampled subsection of a georectified 
image, defining the desired extent in an ImageCRS. Notice that the specified extent could be 
skewed and with curved edges in the offered coverage. When such a skewed/curved extent is 
allowed in the offered coverage, the WCS server should interpret this extent as the minimum 
extent desired, and should extend that extent to the minimum rectangle surrounding that 
desired skewed/curved extent. 

The needed response from the GetCoverage operation includes all: 

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values 

b) CRS of output coverage 

c) Extent of output coverage 

G.2.4 Use case 3: No resampling of unrectified and un-georeferenced image 

 NOTE  This use case also applies when the georeferencing coordinate transformation(s) are not available to 
the server, cannot be used by the server, or are not needed to satisfy the GetCoverage request. 

The GetCoverage request asks a server for an un-resampled subsection of an unrectified and 
un-georeferenced image, defining the desired extent in an ImageCRS.

for unrectified offered image 

G.2.6 Use case 5: No resampling of unrectified but georeferenced image, defining extent in 
ground CRS 

The GetCoverage request asks a server for an un-resampled subsection of an unrectified but 
georeferenced image, defining the desired extent in some 2D or 3D ground CRS 
(GeographicCRS, ProjectedCRS, or either compounded with a VerticalCRS). Notice that the 
specified extent could be skewed and with curved edges in the offered coverage. When such 
a skewed/curved extent is allowed in the offered coverage, the WCS server should interpret 
this extent as the minimum extent desired, and should extend that extent to the minimum 
rectangle surrounding that desired skewed/curved extent. 

The needed response from the GetCoverage operation includes all: 

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values

G.2.12 Addition A  

The following addition applies to uses cases 6 through 10 listed above 

The “differently georectified” or “rectified” or “resampled” output grid requested must be 
able to be resampled into a client-defined grid that is rotated and skewed, with client-defined 
grid spacings and origin position, with respect to the ground base CRS for that grid. This 
client-defined grid in a 3D ground base CRS could be specified by a rectified grid as 
specified in Figure 14 and CV_RectifiedGrid in Clause 8 of ISO 19123. Figure 14 in ISO 
19123 represents a quadrilateral (a parallelogram in general, not necessarily a square or 
rectangle) grid in a plane within the 3D XYZ space, where the axes of the grid can be at any 
angles in the 3D XYZ space. A 2D version of that Figure 14 is shown in Figure G.1. 

 

Figure G.1 — Parallelogram grid within a 2D X-Y space 

NOTE  This client-defined grid in a 2D ground base CRS could be specified by EPSG coordinate operation 
method code 9623, which is specified in Subclause 2.4.2.2 and Figure 8 in EPSG Guidance Note 7.

Notice that the specified extent will often be skewed with curved edges in the desired 
resampled output coverage. A specified skewed and curved extent in the desired resampled 
output coverage should be interpreted as the minimum extent desired, and the server should 
extend this extent to the minimum rectangle surrounding that desired skewed/curved extent. 

The squared-off or original rectangle can be transformed into the corresponding extent in the 
georectified offered coverage. Notice that the transformed extent will often be skewed with 
curved edges in the georectified offered coverage. When the transformed skewed/curved 
extent does not lie wholly within the georectified offered coverage, padding with null values 
is required at all output grid points falling outside the georectified offered coverage. 

G.3 Handling of use cases

The following subclauses further describe how each use case can be handled. 

G.3.2 Use case 1: No resampling of georectified coverage, defining extent in ground CRS 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing a ground CRS (not necessarily the 
base CRS of georectified offered coverage). Any ground CRS can be used that the server can 
transform into the baseCRS of both the offered coverage and the desired output coverage. 
Notice that this DomainSubset BoundingBox extent can be rotated and skewed, without 
curved edges, in the georectified offered coverage. 

NOTE 1 The two specified corners of this BoundingBox are not required to fall exactly on offered coverage 
pixels in order to avoid resampling, since the Output part of the GetCoverage request specifies (or implies) the 
desired wcs:GridCRS of the output coverage. 

The corners of this BoundingBox are first transformed into positions in the georectified 
offered coverage, which in this use case is the same as the wcs:GridCRS of the desired output 
coverage. When that extent is rotated and/or skewed (without curved edges) in the 
georectified offered coverage, a server interprets this extent as the minimum extent desired, 
and next extends that extent to the minimum rectangle surrounding that desired 
rotated/skewed extent. After that transformation and possible extension, the corners of this 
modified BoundingBox are extended to the next grid position in the georectified offered 
coverage. The actual output coverage uses the cell values from the source coverage (when 
they exist). 

EXAMPLE 1 DomainSubset XML fragment (2D): 
<DomainSubset> 
 <ows:BoundingBox crs="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405" dimension="2"> 
  <ows:LowerCorner>30.25 110.15</ows:LowerCorner> 
  <ows:UpperCorner>30.75 110.65</ows:UpperCorner>

BoundingBox=30.25,110.15,30.75,110.65,urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405& 
 
For this use case, the Output part of the GetCoverage request can specify either no CRS or 
the wcs:GridCRS of the georectified offered coverage (not the same CRS as referenced in the 
DomainSubset BoundingBox). When no output grid is specified, this is interpreted by servers 
as requesting the grid of georectified offered coverage. 

Note: The origin of this wcs:GridCRS is NOT required or expected to be the actual position of the origin in the 
GetCoverage operation output, since that origin position is indirectly specified by the OWS BoundingBox in the 
DomainSubset.

19123. The modified wcs:GridCRS origin is at (589, 172). 

G.3.3 Use case 2: No resampling of georectified image, defining extent in image CRS 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing the ImageCRS of the georectified 
offered coverage. Notice that this extent cannot be skewed or with curved edges in the 
georectified offered coverage.

For this use case, the Output part of the GetCoverage request can specify either no CRS or 
the wcs:GridCRS of the georectified offered coverage (not the same CRS as referenced in the 
DomainSubset BoundingBox). When no output grid is specified, this is interpreted by servers 
as requesting the grid of georectified offered coverage.

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values 
b) ows:BoundingBox, referencing the wcs:GridCRS for the output coverage that references 

the ground CRS of the georectified offered coverage (required unless all this information 
is included in the coverage format used)

NOTE  In this example, the LowerCorner is the (0, 0) origin of this output grid, in compliance with ISO 
19123. 

G.3.4 Use case 3: No resampling of unrectified and un-georeferenced image 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing the ImageCRS of the unrectified 
offered coverage. Notice that this extent cannot be skewed or with curved edges in the 
unrectified offered coverage. 

EXAMPLE 1 DomainSubset XML fragment (2D):

BoundingBox=1000,2000,1511,2511,urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:0.0:ImageCRSpixelCenter:Image
CrsID& 

 
For this use case, the Output part of the GetCoverage request does not specify any 
wcs:GridCRS. The CRS used by the actual output coverage will be the ImageCRS of the 
offered image usually with different origin point or pixel. 

For this use case, the GetCoverage response contains: 

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values 
b) ows:BoundingBox (XML encoded), referencing the ImageCRS for output image 

(required unless all this information is included in the coverage format used) 

EXAMPLE 5 XML fragment (2D): (when XML encoded)

NOTE  In this example, the LowerCorner is the (0, 0) origin of this output grid, in compliance with ISO 
19123. The wcs:GridCRS origin is at (1000, 2000). 

G.3.5 Use case 4: No resampling of unrectified but georeferenced image, defining extent in 
image CRS 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing the ImageCRS of the georectified 
offered coverage. Notice that this extent cannot be skewed or with curved edges in the 
unrectified offered image.

For this use case, the Output part of the GetCoverage request does not specify any 
wcs:GridCRS. The CRS used by the actual output coverage will be the ImageCRS of the 
offered image, usually with different origin point or pixel. 

For this use case, the GetCoverage response contains: 

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values 

b) ows:BoundingBox (XML encoded), referencing the ImageCRS of output image (required 
unless all this information is included in the coverage format used) 

c) Mandatory georeferencing coordinate Transformation(s), referencing the ImageCRS of 
the output image (this Transformation(s) might be included in the coverage format used) 

EXAMPLE 3 XML fragment (2D): (when XML encoded)

NOTE  In this example, the LowerCorner is the (0, 0) origin of this output grid, in compliance with ISO 
19123. 

G.3.6 Use case 5: No resampling of unrectified but georeferenced image, defining extent in 
ground CRS 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing a ground CRS (not necessarily the 
base CRS of the georeferencing Transformations). Any ground CRS can be used that the 
server can transform into the baseCRS of both the offered coverage and the desired re-

rectified output coverage. Notice that this extent can be skewed with curved edges in the 
offered coverage. 

NOTE 1 The two specified corners of this BoundingBox are not required to fall exactly on offered coverage 
pixels in order to avoid resampling, since the Output part of the GetCoverage request implies the ImageCRS of 
the offered image. 

EXAMPLE 1 DomainSubset XML fragment (2D): 
<DomainSubset> 
 <ows:BoundingBox crs="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405" dimension="2">

BoundingBox=30.25,110.15,30.75,110.65,urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:63266405& 
 
For this use case, the Output part of the GetCoverage request does not specify any 
wcs:GridCRS. The CRS used by the actual output coverage will be the ImageCRS of the 
offered image, usually with different origin point or pixel. 

For this use case, the GetCoverage response contains: 

a) Array of output coverage grid/pixel values 
b) ows:BoundingBox (XML encoded), referencing the ImageCRS of output image (required 

unless all this information is included in the coverage format used) 

c) Mandatory georeferencing coordinate Transformation(s), referencing the ImageCRS of 
the output image (this Transformation(s) might be included in the coverage format used)

<ows:BoundingBox crs="imageCRSofOutputCoverage" dimension="2"> 
 <ows:LowerCorner>0 0</ows:LowerCorner> 
 <ows:UpperCorner>7 7</ows:UpperCorner> 
</ows:BoundingBox> 

 
NOTE 2 In this example, the LowerCorner is the (0, 0) origin of this output grid, in compliance with ISO 
19123. The wcs:GridCRS origin is at (589, 172). 

G.3.7 Use case 6: Resampling of georectified coverage, defining extent in ground CRS 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing a ground CRS (not necessarily the 
base of desired re-rectified output coverage) Any ground CRS can be used that the server can 
transform into the baseCRS of both the offered coverage and the desired re-rectified output 
coverage. Notice that this extent can be skewed with curved edges in the georectified offered 
coverage and in the desired output image.

For this use case, the Output part of the GetCoverage request can specify any wcs:GridCRS 
that does not specify the same grid points as the wcs:GridCRS of the georectified offered 
coverage. This wcs:GridCRS is the desired CRS of the output coverage. The baseCRS of this 
wcs:GridCRS (roughly) corresponds to the old ResponseCRS. This wcs:GridCRS contains 
additional information, including the information corresponding to the WCS 1.0 RESX, 
RESY, and RESZ. The baseCRS of this wcs:GridCRS can be any ground CRS, either the 
same as or different from the georectified offered coverage. 

NOTE 1 If only the origin in this output wcs:GridCRS is different from the GridCRS of the georectified 
offered coverage, but that origin is at a different grid point in the GridCRS of the georectified offered coverage, 
then this output GridCRS specifies the same grid positions and no resampling is needed, see use case 1

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing the ImageCRS of the georectified 
offered coverage. Notice that this extent cannot be skewed or with curved edges in the 
unrectified offered coverage. However, this extent can be skewed with curved edges in the 
desired output image.

G.3.9 Use case 8: Resampling of unrectified and un-georeferenced image 

For this use case, the GetCoverage request can specify a DomainSubset that includes an 
OWS BoundingBox (XML or KVP encoded) referencing the ImageCRS of unrectified 
offered coverage. Notice that this extent cannot be skewed or with curved edges in the 
unrectified offered coverage. However, this extent can be skewed with straight edges in the

Annex H 
(normative) 

 
Other data structures 

H.1 Overview 

This annex specifies the Coverages data structure that is used by this WCS, with the Manifest 
data structure that it uses. This annex also specifies the InterpolationMethods data structure. 

NOTE  Although discussed here as parts of WCS, the Coverages and InterpolationMethods might be placed 
in a separate document specifying aspects specific to coverages that are used by multiple Implementation 
specifications. 

H.2 Coverages data structure 

H.2.1 Introduction 

In some cases, an operation response can consist of a group of coverages where each 
coverage uses essentially the same contents as the ReferenceGroup specified in Subclause 
13.3 of OWS Common [OGC 06-121r3]. Similarly, part of an operation request can contain a 
group of coverages using essentially the same contents. That is, this “Coverages” data 
structure is similar to a Manifest data straucture which can contain multiple coverages, where 
each coverage can be a group of related data items. In this use, all of these data items might 
be contained in one package that is transferred as the operation response or in the operation 
request mesage, or some of these data items might be stored elsewhere for subsequent 
retrieval. 

EXAMPLE 1 Some responses to a WCS GetCoverage operation can contain multiple groups of related data 
items, where each group contains an output coverage with its metadata. 

EXAMPLE 2 The request for a WCS Transaction operation will contain multiple groups of related data 
items, where each group is an input coverage with its metadata. 

This subclause thus defines a Coverages class, and corresponding element, which may be 
used by specific OWSs. This Coverages class uses the ReferenceGroup class renamed 
Coverage. These classes are included in the Coverages package UML class diagram in Figure 
H.1. 

For Coverages used as an operation input, each Coverage may include data items that are 
accessible from another OGC or other web service using an operation. If this operation 
request is KVP encoded, that complete operation request shall be encoded as a URL value, in 
the xlink:href attribute in the AbstractReferenceBaseType. However, if this operation request 
is XML encoded, a XML encoded operation request must be sent to the other web server 
whose operation URL is referenced by the xlink:href attribute. Each Coverage may thus use 
the ServiceReference (class and element) as specified in Subclause 13.5 of [OGC 06-121r3]. 
This class is a subclass of the Reference class, which adds a UML attribute that either

contains or references the XML encoded operation request needed to retrieve this input data 
from the other web server.

H.3 Interpolation methods 

H.3.1 Interpolation methods contents 

The InterpolationMethods data structure lists one or more spatial interpolation methods, 
which can each be used for interpolation of a range record field in a continuous grid 
coverage. The InterpolationMethods shall use the data structure described in Figure H.2 and 
specified in Tables H.1 through Table H.4.

InterpolationMethods has a mandatory Default parameter that identifies the spatial 
interpolation method used for GetCoverage requests that don’t specify one. 
InterpolationMethods may also have zero or more InterpolationMethod parameters whose 
values identify other spatial interpolation methods that the server can use for this coverage 
range field. When the only listed (default) interpolation method is “none”, clients may only 
retrieve subsets of this offered coverage in its offered CRS and at its offered resolution.

For a continuous grid coverage, the normal spatial interpolation types are listed in Table 
H.3 and in the attached default InterpolationMethods.xml dictionary. Compared to ISO 
19123, WCS does not distinguish linear from bilinear, quadratic from biquadratic, and 
cubic from bicubic interpolation. For WCS, the linear, quadratic, and cubic interpolation 
methods shall be applicable to coverages of any number of spatial dimensions. Servers 
may implement and list other interpolation methods, defined in dictionaries other than the 
default. 

NOTE 1 The interpolation methods "lost area" and "barycentric" are not applicable to grid coverages, hence 
they are not included in this version of WCS.

These are defined in ISO 19123 (Schema for Coverage 
Geometry and Functions), Annex B. 

none None No interpolation is available; requests must be for 
locations that are among the original domain locations. 

a ISO 19123 specifies two-dimensional bilinear, biquadratic, and bicubic interpolation types. When also interpolating in 
the elevation dimension of a 3D CRS, the 3D extensions of these interpolation types shall be used. 

 
Each InterpolationMethod element has an optional nullResistance summarizing how the 
server treats null-valued points in interpolation. The normal values for this parameter are 
listed in Table H.4 and in the default InterpolationMethods.xml dictionary. 

NOTE 2 These nullResistance values are sent from a server to a client, to summarize how the server treats 
null-valued points. These nullResistance values are NOT sent from a client to a server (to indicate how the client 
wants null-valued points treated). 

Table H.4 — Effect of null values in spatial interpolation 

nullResistance Description 
full Nulls in the input grid(s) have no effect on interpolated value; resampling uses 

only non-null valued cells. 
none Interpolated value is Null when any one input value is Null. 
half Interpolated value is Null when half or more input values are Null. 
other Resampling treats nulls differently than any method described above 
 
H.3.2 Interpolation methods XML encoding 

A set of interpolation methods can be XML encoded, in each Field in the Range part of each 
CoverageDescription. The XML encoding of InterpolationMethods shall use the XML 
Schema fragment in the attached wcsInterpolationMethod.xsd file. The InterpolationType 
and nullResistance are UML <CodeList> stereotyped classes, which are thus converted into 
XML Schema following the GML pattern for XML encoding of <CodeList> classes. 

That is, in wcsInterpolationMethod.xsd, the normal values of InterpolationType and 
nullResistance are NOT encoded in the XML Schema, but in the default-referenced GML 
Dictionary. That Dictionary document is named interpolationMethods.xml and also attached 
to this document. This approach is used since not all useful values of these quantities are 
currently known, and this approach allows additional values to be more easily specified and 
used.  

EXAMPLE  Here is an example InterpolationMethods data structure encoded in XML. It lists four 
interpolation methods: the first three (“cubic,” “linear,” “quadratic”) are defined in the default codespace 
dictionary; the fourth (“sinusoidal”) is defined at the URL given in the codeSpace attribute. 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

H.3.3 Interpolation method KVP encoding 

One selected interpolation method can be KVP encoded for each range field in a 
GetCoverage operation request as specified in Subclause 10.2.2.
