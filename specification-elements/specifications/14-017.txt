1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

The National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) is a US government programme 
commissioned to facilitate the exchange of data between multiple and different 
Communities of Interest (CoI) at all levels of government. CoI are groups of practitioners 
and technical representatives who authoritatively represent their respective domains and 
thus have a stake in NIEM information exchanges. Among components of the initiative is 
the NIEM data model, which provides the reference vocabulary for consistent and 
reusable intra- and interdomain information exchanges. The NIEM data model is 
represented as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema in order to provide a 
common framework for data exchange between different information systems. In order to 
facilitate reusability, NIEM adopts different namespaces for codelists from different 
authoritative sources. The Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD) are 
collections of artefacts that define and describe the structure and content of an 
Information Exchange Package (IEP), which itself is the real data and metadata 
transmitted during exchange. One important source of motivation for the development of 
NIEM is the need for shared situational awareness when federal agencies respond to 
incidents. 

Shared Situational Awareness is typically achieved through provision of a Common 
Operating Picture (COP), which refers to a single representation of relevant information, 
within an area of interest, tailored to the user’s requirements and based on common data 
and information that could be shared across service command centres during a multi-
agency response [6]. The term Request for Information (RFI) is used to describe the 
format in which an information need is specified and passed between different agencies, 
allowing the responding agencies to provide information to the requestor that addresses 
the specified information need. To facilitate shared situational awareness between the 
requestor and the agency responding to the RFI it can be beneficial to provide a COP that 
is accessible to both the requestor and responder. 

This engineering report aims to describe an approach for encoding a NIEM RFI IEPD 
with an OGC Web Services Context (OWS Context) document embedded inside the 
IEPD. The OGC Web Services Context Document (OWS Context) standard has been 
developed to facilitate configuration of a set information resources that are to be passed 
between applications. The information resources are typically services but may also be 
in-line content. The goal of OWS Context is to support use cases such as the distribution 
of search results, the exchange of collections of resources such as OGC Web Feature 
Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), Web 
Coverage Service (WCS) and others. OWS Context can therefore be considered to 
provide the ability to specify a COP such that the area of interest, time range, resources 
and their configuration is unambiguously exchanged between applications. This

capability makes OWS Context a potential enabler of operations across different federal 
agencies and COI, hence the requirement to investigate the possibility to wrap OWS 
Context documents in NIEM RFI IEPDs. 

To achieve the aim of this engineering report, the following objectives have been 
identified: 

1. Review the findings of the Geo4NIEM interoperability experiment 

2. Identify the relevant rules in the NIEM Naming and Design Rules 

3. Design solution options 

4. Produce sample encodings 

5. Discuss and document findings

5 Background Information 

This section presents a review of relevant recent works and standards. 

5.1 Review of the Geo4NIEM Engineering Report 

The Geo4NIEM interoperability experiment was commissioned by the US Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS), NIEM Program Management Office and the Office of the 
Program Manager for the ISE (PM-ISE) to enhance interoperability with respect to the 
handling of geospatial information based on OGC standards and NIEM-conformant 
information exchanges. A primary goal of the interoperability experiment was to improve 
understanding of strategies for including or embedding data conforming to one 
framework into another. Another goal was to assess the feasibility of the various 
approaches through software demonstrations, including through the use of OGC web 
services. 

The Geo4NIEM interoperability experiment observed that version 1.3 of the NIEM 
Naming and Design Rules (NDR) document specifies rules and principles for developing 
conforming data components and schemas [5]. Section 7 of the NDR specifies the rules 
for the creating and using external adaptor types. “The adapter mechanism is the only 
means of incorporating content from an external namespace into NIEM-conformant 
schemas” [4]. In considering support for GML within NIEM, the Geo4NIEM 
interoperability experiment focused on the extensibility offered by creation and use of 
external adapter types. 

The interoperability experiment recommended that the reference schema in NIEM should 
define geometry adapters that cover the basic geometry types allowed by the GML 
Simple Features Profile. Other recommendations most relevant to this OGC Testbed 10  
included the definition of a generic feature adapter, definition of a general purpose 
geometry adapter, removal of adapters for curve segments and deprecation of adapters of 
specific GML elements.

5.2 Review of Naming and Design Rules 

The following rules from Section 7 of the NDR are relevant to Testbed 10. As the rules 
relate to NIEM 2.1, this engineering report identifies key changes observed in NIEM 3.0 
that should be considered in future applications of the NDR. Whereas NIEM 3.0 schemas 
have been published, revisions of the NDR were still pending at the time of writing this 
engineering report. Therefore, changes discussed in this section were identified through 
examination of the schemas. 

 Rule 7-61: Within the schema, an element xsd:import that imports a namespace 
defined by an external schema MUST have the application information 
appinfo:ConformantIndicator, with a value of false. None of the NIEM 3.0 
external adapters were observed to include the ConformantIndicator elements. 
This suggests that use of the element is now deprecated, however, should be 
confirmed when the NIEM NDR revision is published. 

 Rule 7-62: Within the schema, an element xsd:import that imports a namespace 
defined by an external schema MUST be a documented component. 

 Rule 7-63: Within the schema, an adapter type MUST have application 
information appinfo:ExternalAdapterTypeIndicator with a value of true. A type 
that is not an adapter type SHALL NOT contain that indicator. Testbed 10 
participants observed that in NIEM 3.0, the attribute name is in lowerCamelCase 
i.e. appinfo:externalAdapterTypeIndicator. 

 Rule 7-64: Within the schema, an adapter type MUST be an immediate extension 
of type structures:ComplexObjectType. Testbed 10 participants observed that 
structures:ComplexObjectType is not available within NIEM 3.0, presumably due 
to deprecation, and has been replaced with structures:ObjectType. 

 Rule 7-65: Within the schema, an adapter type MUST be composed of only 
elements and attributes from an external standard. 

 Rule 7-66: Within the schema, an element reference used in an adapter type 
definition MUST be a documented component. 

 Rule 7-67: Within the schema, an attribute reference used in an adapter type 
definition MUST be a documented component. 

 Rule 7-68: Within the schema, an adapter type MUST NOT be extended or 
restricted.

5.3 Review of IEPDs 

A review of the NIEM IEPD clearinghouse on January 5th 2014 showed that there were 
192 shared IEPDs registered, none of which had been registered after the date of release 
of NIEM 3.0. This suggests that NIEM 2.0 is still the more widely implemented version. 

In the intelligence domain, Requests for Information (RFI) are mechanisms through 
which analysts and other operators can request and receive relevant information for 
processing and analysis. The Geo4NIEM interoperability experiment extended the DHS 
RFI IEPD to explore the conversion of NIEM exchange messages to GML feature type 
instances. This suggests that extension of an RFI IEPD to include Classes that have 
properties to hold OWS Context objects would be consistent with the approach adopted 
by Geo4NIEM. 

The participants of the testbed reviewed a selection of IEPDs offered by the NIEM 
clearinghouse and observed that the Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU)/Controlled 
Unclassified Information (CUI) Secure Federated Search IEPD used by Law 
Enforcement agencies imports an extension of an Atom feed to include external content 
that uses NIEM types [7]. The SBU/CUI Secure Federated Search (SFS) has been 
developed to help establish a nationwide secure federated search that allows authorized 
law enforcement and homeland security personnel to search across domains, retrieving 
structured and unstructured data. Some of the content exchanged in the Federated Search 
system is encoded as Atom-formatted content, with restrictions as specified in the 
modified Atom schema. This suggests that development of Atom-encoded OWS Context 
documents that can also hold external (non-OGC) content would be consistent with the 
Federated Search IEPD. 

6 Use Cases 

A number of possible uses of an OWS Context document are identified in the standard, 
these include: 

 UC1. Exchange of a common view or common operating picture for shared 
situational awareness. 

 UC2. Exchange of discovery results from various catalogue searches, to avoid 
duplication of effort. 

 UC3. Exchange of configuration and/or results of an analysis or processing 
activity. 

Of the above listed use cases, the first is most applicable to RFI. Indeed, the OWS 
Context standard acknowledges that the exchange of a COP is recognized as the most 
important usage of the OWS Context Document. As illustrated in Table 1, the use case 
may involve, for example, the agency issuing the RFI also sharing its operating picture 
with the agency responding to the RFI.

Table 1. Use Case UC1 – Exchange of a common view or common operating picture 

Title UC1. Exchange of a common view or common operating picture 
for shared situational awareness. 

Actors Requesting Agency, Providing Agency, System 

Pre-condition 

 

The Requesting Agency has a need for information collected by the 
Providing Agency but does not currently have access to the 
required information 

Trigger An incident occurs requiring resources from multiple agencies 

Basic Flow 1. Requesting Agency creates a NIEM RFI with an embedded 
OWS Context document that gives detailed background 
information about the requested information 

2. Requesting Agency sends the enhanced NIEM RFI to the 
Providing Agency 

3. Providing Agency processes the RFI 

4. Providing Agency returns the requested information 

Post-condition The information needs of the Requesting Agency have been met 

 

The second use case may be applicable in situations where, for example, there is a need 
to share catalogue inventories or their subsets in order to avoid duplication of effort. 
Where some of the resources cannot be directly accessed, an RFI could be embedded to 
identify specific information resources and their publishing organisations. 

Table 2. Use Case UC2 – Exchange of discovery results from various catalogue searches 

Title UC2. Exchange of discovery results from various catalogue 
searches, to avoid duplication of effort. 

Actors Client application, Federated Search System 

Pre-condition A user(e.g. analyst) has an information need that requires searching 
multiple catalogue services from different agencies 

Trigger A user initiates a search through a client application 

Basic Flow 1. Client application sends a distributed search request to the 
federation of catalogue services 



OGC 14-017 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium. 9 
 

2. Client application receives discovery results, from the 
catalogue services, encoded as OWS Context documents 

3. Client application removes duplicate resources from the 
discovery results 

4. Client application presents the processed discovery results 

Post-condition The user’s information needs have been met 

 

The third use may be applicable to situations where information is sought in relation to 
results of an analysis or processing activity. An RFI could for example include a context 
document that retrieves the latest calculations from a plume modelling web processing 
service. 

Table 3. Use Case UC3 – Exchange of configuration and/or results of an analysis or processing 
activity 

Title UC3. Exchange of configuration and/or results of an analysis or 
processing activity. 

Actors Analyst 1, Analyst 2 

Pre-condition 

 

A collection of services have been made available to different 
analysts working on the same data but from the perspective of 
different domains (e.g. in a MULTI-INT environment). 

Trigger An incident occurs requiring resources from multiple agencies 

Basic Flow 1. Analyst 1 configures an analysis process and invokes it. 

2. Upon completion of the analysis process, Analyst 1 
generates an OWS Context document with the configuration 
of the analysis 

3. Analyst 1 publishes the configuration to Analyst 2 

4. Analyst 2 uses the configuration to initiate his own 
analytical process. 

Post-condition Analyst 2 has an analysis configuration that resembles that of 
Analyst 1

7 Solution Options 

This section presents a number of solution options for integrating OWS Context in 
NIEM. 

7.1 Option 1 

Options 1 involves creating an RFIRequestContextType, which then contains both a DHS 
RFIRequestType and an Atom encoded OWS Context document. An alternative could be 
to wrap a representation of the OWS Context conceptual model however, the Atom 
encoding of OWS Context is favoured due to the potential mass uptake by Atom readers.

7.2 Option 2 

Options 2 involves using OWS Context, without any modifications, to contain a DHS 
RFIRequestType. Effectively this would be a profile of OWS Context. It should be noted 
that an OWS Context ContentType type could be modelled to accept types from the 
NIEM structures:ObjectType substitution group (or structures:ComplexObjectType for 
NIEM 2.1). Use of a substitution group would allow the OWS Context ContentType to 
hold the RFIRequestType and other types from the substitution group

8 Discussion 

The testbed considered the possibility of extending the DHS RFI type in order to 
encapsulate an OWS Context document. Such an approach would however violate NDR 
rule 7-68, which requires that an adapter should not be extended or restricted. The testbed 
therefore modelled the solution options as presented in the previous sections. 

Solution Option 1 has the advantage of allowing any number of DHS RFI elements to be 
associated with any number of OWS Context documents. In relation to the use cases 
presented in Section 1, the ability to associate any number of RFI elements with any 
number of OWS Context documents could allow a single RFI to support multiple 
common operating pictures tailored for different emergency services. For example, a 
single RFI on the state of roads could support separate OWS Context documents 
designed to support law enforcement and emergency medical services. Solution Option 1 
also has the advantage of not requiring any profiling of neither the RFI nor OWS Context 
documents. This means that once the elements are extracted from the root element, they 
can be handled by current applications as-is. The solution option has the disadvantage 
that the root element would be from a new and non-NIEM type, which may require 
current applications to be modified in order to support the new type. 

Solution Option 2 has the advantage of explicitly associating an RFI with the OWS 
Context document that contains it. The solution option also has the advantage that the 
root element is an Atom feed, which is widely supported in both the geo and non-geo 
domains. Wrapping content in an Atom feed would also be consistent with existing 
NIEM IEPDs such as the Secure Federated Search IEPD [7]. Conversely, solution option 
2 has the disadvantage that as the RFI is embedded inside the OWS Context document, it 
is not possible for a single RFI document to reference multiple OWS Context documents. 
The same RFI would need to be repeated for it to support multiple OWS context 
offerings.

9 Conclusions 

This report has presented an approach for integrating OWS Context documents in NIEM. 
The report offers different solution options for modeling an enhancement of the DHS RFI 
IEPD and provides a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the different 
solution options. The report also provided an overview of NIEM Naming and Definition 
Rules, identifying those rules that have most impact on the integration of OWS Context 
in NIEM. The report also presented an overview of possible use cases. 

The report concludes that it is possible to integrate OWS Context and NIEM. There are 
several potential benefits of such integration but most of all the ability to distribute 
common operating pictures and improve shared situational awareness. 

10 Recommendations 

The following recommendations have been identified. 

10.1 Integrate OWS Context into more IEPDs 

The findings of this OGC testbed provide a means for integrating OWS Context in RFI 
IEPDs. The solution options presented are generic enough to be applied to a variety of 
IEPDs. It is therefore recommended that OWS Context be integrated into other IEPDs. 

10.2 Update of the NIEM Naming and Definition Rules 

The current version of the NDR is based on previous version of NIEM. There are 
therefore references to complexTypes that are not present in version 3.0 of NIEM. It is 
therefore recommended that the NDR be updated to be inline with NIEM 3.0. 

10.3 Update of IEPDs to use NIEM 3.0 

Several existing IEPDs were found to have been published prior to the release of NIEM 
3.0. Therefore producers of those IEPDs should be encouraged to upgrade their 
implementations to NIEM 3.0. It is therefore updated that existing IEPDs be updated to 
adopt NIEM 3.0.
