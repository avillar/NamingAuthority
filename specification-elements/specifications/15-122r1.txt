iii. Preface 
The	GeoPackage	Standards	Working	Group	(SWG)	has	identified	a	need	to	encode	
vector	feature	presentation-related	information	within	a	GeoPackage.	This	
document	describes	multiple	use	cases	for	the	conveyance	of	feature	presentation

these	use	cases	and	to	discuss	the	constraints,	implications,	limitations	and	
justification	of	each	use	case.	The	result	of	the	discussion	paper	will	provide	one	or	
more	prioritized	recommendations	for	supporting	symbology	in	GeoPackage	
containers.		

Attention	is	drawn	to	the	possibility	that	some	of	the	elements	of	this	document	may

1. Scope 

The members of the GeoPackage Standards Working Group (SWG) have identified a 
need for the ability to exchange symbology-encoded features. This capability will be used 
to support various use cases, such as the following: 

 Visualization 
o 2D and 3D presentation of symbology 

 Analysis 
 2D, 3D and nD analysis of features1 

Ideally this capability will be relatively easy to implement and will be suitable for a wide 
variety of computing environments including mobile/handheld. As a practical matter, 
each of the use cases discuss herein presupposes one or more operational constraints, or 
imposes operational limitations on producers or consumers of GeoPackages containing 
symbology. 

2. References 

2.1 Normative References 
The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this 
text, constitute provisions of this document. For dated references, subsequent 
amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated 
references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies. 

                                                
1 Analysis is referenced to highlight the separation between feature geometry and presentation rendering 
primitives. The encoding of symbology presentation information must not negatively impact the ability of 
consumers of GeoPackage to perform analysis. Specifically, decomposition of complex symbols (e.g., 
geodetic ellipses, n-sided polygons, or spirals) into simple elements for the purpose of rendering MUST 
NOT negatively impact the ability of systems to perform analysis of features.

3. Terms and Definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is 
based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 
to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard. 

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply. 

3.1  
military symbology 
Pictographic representations of features, movements or events on a map or other 
geospatial display context that convey information visually, particularly as it pertains to 
military arts (e.g. MILSTD-2525, NATO-APP6). 

3.2  
technical symbology 
Pictographic representations of features, movements or events on a map or other 
geospatial display context that convey information visually, particularly as it pertains to 
technical or scientific arts, such as weather symbols, emergency management symbols, 
aviation, geology, agriculture or any specialized fields that uses pictorial representations 
of ground, air, or water features (e.g. Homeland Security Working Group Emergency 
Response Symbology).

3.3  
symbol identifier (symbol ID) 
Each unique symbol within a symbology set is assigned a unique identifier within the 
symbology set. Each symbology set defines a set of rules for the composition of symbol 
components that are assembled from a decomposition of the symbol ID. For the purpose 
of this discussion, the symbol is modeled as an opaque resource string of indeterminate 
length, as it is beyond the scope of this document to detail symbol ID composition rules, 
which vary by symbology set, revision and even among change notices.  
 
For the purpose of this discussion, the symbol ID is modeled as an opaque resource string 
of indeterminate length, as it is beyond the scope of this document to detail symbol ID 
composition rules, which vary by symbology set, revision and even among change 
notices. 

3.4  
symbology set 
A collection of pictograms or glyphs that are used to visually depict features. A 
symbology set may also include an explicit set of rules for the composition and rendering 
of symbol. A symbology set may also rely on implicit rules for rendering a symbol, 
consisting of a single PNG or SVG renderable object for each unique symbol ID. A 
symbology set identifier is a opaque resource string of indeterminate length that uniquely 
identifies the symbology set. It is beyond the scope of this document to document the 
details of the symbology set identifier  (E.g. MIL-STD-2525B-CN1, NATO-APP6(B), or 
HSWG-ERS-2.0) 

3.5  
extended symbol ID 
The concatenation of the symbology set identifier and the symbol identifier is collectively 
referred to the extended symbol ID for the purpose of this document. The extended 
symbol ID uniquely identifies a symbol across all possible symbol sets. 

3.6  
symbol modifier 
Military symbology specifications (MIL-STD-2525 and NATO APP-6) allow the 
addition of text and graphic modifiers to be applied to a base symbol. For the purpose of 
this discussion, these modifiers further extend the extended symbol ID to define the 
symbol instance resource identifier. The symbol instance resource identifier must 
uniquely identify the symbol instance and the binding of a specific feature. 

3.7  
feature geometry 
Refers to the geospatial positions that define a simple feature, such as a point, line, 
polyline or polygon. Feature geometries are typically expressed in absolute spatial 
coordinates, and are bound by simple feature topology rules. 



OGC 15-122r1

3.8  
symbol geometry 
Refers to the drawing primitive geometry that is required to render a symbol at the 
location designated by the feature geometry. Symbol geometry is typically expressed in 
coordinates relative to the feature geometry. 

3.9  
control point geometry 
Refers to the geospatial positions that define the parametric control points for a symbol. 
Control point geometry is expressed in absolute spatial coordinates, which often 
corresponds exactly with the feature geometry, but are not bound to topology rules. 
Within the scope of this discussion, control points refer to the corresponding control 
points within the symbol definition, including point ordinality restrictions. 

3.10  
delineation 
Refers to the geometric dimension associated with the spatial attribute used to portray a 
feature. 

4. Process 

The SWG developed this approach by leveraging a series of interactions between October 
2012 and November 2015, as part of Army Technical Working Groups Common Overlay 
and Single Shared Geospatial Foundation (SSGF). The Common Overlay Working 
Group, sponsored by Army Geospatial Center, and the GeoPackage SWG email list and 
teleconferences were the primary means of discussion and decision-making leading this 
discussion paper.  

5. Discussion 

Several use cases have been identified to highlight a need to support Symbology 
exchange within GeoPackage.  The following discussion details these use cases and 
explores the implications and limitations of symbology support options for GeoPackage. 
The use cases fall into two broad categories: internal symbol references and external 
symbol references.  

This discussion paper also draws attention to three distinct types of geometry identified 
as relevant to symbology. These geometry types are feature geometry, symbol geometry, 
and control point geometry, which are defined in section 3, Terms and Definitions. 

A recommendation to decouple the symbology encoding effort from the GeoPackage 
charter has been proposed within the GeoPackage SWG. The rationale for this 
recommendation is due to the broader applicability of an updated symbology encoding 
standard to all users of Simple Features. Instead of incorporating the symbology encoding 



OGC 15-122r1 

10 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

as an extension within GeoPackage specification, it should serve to drive or incubate this 
vital capability and validate the resulting symbology expression standard. 

As web mapping technology evolves, so must the standards that support mapping and 
symbology. Recent efforts such as CartoCSS and YSLD are gaining favor in the web 
map application community over XML-based standards such as OGC Style Layer 
Description (SLD), OGC Style Encoding Standard (SES) and NATO Vector Graphics 
(NVG). 

CartoCSS and YSLD eschew the overhead of XML parsing for a CSS-style encoding of 
cartographic style information. NVG borrows heavily from the rendering primitive 
approach of SVG, defining geospatial primitives that include simple features as well as 
more complex primitives such as multi-point, rectangles, arrows, circles, ellipses, 
corridors, arcs and orbits, as well as composition operations.  

A recommendation has been forwarded to the NVG governing body to separate the NVG 
symbol model from the encoding syntax (XML), as well as separating the services 
definition from the model. Similarly, YSLD proposes to retain the SLD model and 
substitute a browser-friendly encoding for XML2. 

6. Symbol/Style References 

6.1 External Symbol/Style References 
External symbol/style references provide a linkage between a vector feature instance and 
a symbol/style lookup mechanism that is external to the GeoPackage, hereafter referred 
to as in external symbol reference. External symbol references refer to resources that 
require additional external resources or mechanisms to fully resolve symbol references. 

Examples of external references include the use of symbol libraries and rendering 
algorithms required to draw MIL-STD-2525 symbology, modifiers and amplification 
text.  

6.1.1 USE CASE #1 Military Symbology Set (UC1) 
Military symbologies are characterized by highly structured, hierarchical symbology-
lookup schemes. Symbology presentation consists of a symbology set identifier (such as 
MIL-STD-2525-B-CN13), a Symbol ID, zero or more modifiers that affect the graphic or 
text, annotation text, and control point geometries that determine the position, orientation 
and/or scale of the military symbol. Due to the complex rendering rules and standards 
define for military symbology, the rendering rules are difficult to express without the use 
of rendering heuristics found within rendering libraries. Thus UC1 would typically

3 MIL-STD-2525-B-CN1 Refers to MIL-STD-2525 Revision B, Change Notice 1. 



OGC 15-122r1 

11 
Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

require an external style reference. A special case of UC1, which is restricted to a single 
control point geometry, could be expressed as an internal reference symbol, but the need 
to encode text and graphic modifiers requires a one-to-one relationship between feature 
instance and symbol instance resource (i.e. one sprite per feature), resulting in significant 
storage overhead. 

The following information must be encoded within a feature instance attribute record to 
express the symbol rendering information for an external symbol reference: 

 Symbology Set Designation or URI 
 Symbol ID 
 Text Modifier(s) 
 Graphic Modifier(s) 
 Control Point Geometry 

 1 Point 
 2 Points 
 3+ Points 

 
Rendering rules for military symbology will sometimes contain guidance to support 
symbol clustering and multiscale rendering. Such libraries require rendering context 
information that extends to the entire renderable footprint, and the scale of the rendering 
surface in order to satisfy specific rendering standard guidance, such as Army Doctrine 
Reference Publication (ADRP 1-02), Terms and Military Symbols. 

6.1.1.1 UC1 Implications 
The use of external military symbology support libraries introduces external 
dependencies, thereby eliminating self-contained symbology approaches. Even if the 
SVG symbol library files where carried as payload within GeoPackage file, the business 
rules required to compose military symbology to each feature would also need to be 
encoded with the symbol extension. No rule language has been identified that could meet 
this functional requirement.   

Although open source rendering libraries such as Mission Command mil-sym project 
(Java, Javascript, Android), Spatial Illusions, and FalconView Library exist, each 
implementation invokes a language-specific dependency, and no single implementation 
support all revisions and change notices of MIL-STD-2525 or NATO APP6 symbology 
standards. 

A GeoPackage extension would be required to encode the symbol set ID, symbol ID, 
modifiers, and control point geometry in the primary feature attribute tables, or a 
secondary attribute table. 

The use of an external library eliminates implied or expressed responsibility of rendering 
consistency, placing this responsibility solely within the external rendering library. This 
approach maintains the exchange-based model of the GeoPackage standard, which 
hitherto does not address rendering or style.

6.1.2 USE CASE #2 Feature Styling Set – External (UC2)  
Feature styling is characterized by feature rendering heuristics or rules that depend on 
rendering context such as scale and feature conflict areas. Styling presentation consists of 
a styling set identifier (such as GeoSym V5), a Feature code (e.g. FACC4), and the 
feature geometry that serves as input to the feature styling rule. 

 Feature Set Designation 
 Feature Code 
 Feature Geometry 

 
Rendering rules for feature styling may contain guidance to support feature clustering and 
multiscale rendering or Level of Detail (LOD) management. LOD management includes 
selective rendering and deconfliction. Such capabilities require sophisticated rendering 
business rules and rendering context information that extends to the entire renderable 
footprint, and the scale of the rendering surface in order to satisfy specific rendering 
standard guidance. Examples include such as Geospatial Symbols for Digital Displays 
(GeoSym) that used feature geometry and feature codes to support sophisticated 
multiscale rendering. 

Potential components of Feature Styles: 

 GeoPackage Vectors with Style ID 
– Vector attributes specify a Style ID 
– Style ID refers to a Style “table” that contains 

 Line Style (Color, Width, Transparency, Dash, Miter, End, …) 
information (i.e. Symbology Encoding Standard) 

 Fill Style (Pattern, Transparency) 
– Styles may be shared or feature unique 
– Style rules are identified by numeric or alphanumeric identifier  

6.1.2.1 UC2 Implications 
The use of rendering rules, leveraging rendering context such as scale and feature 
deconfliction requires external business logical that is difficult to encode within a feature 
record in any practical manner. Even if the necessary drawing library files where carried 
as payload within GeoPackage file, the business rules required to handle rendering scale 
and context such as deconfliction would likely preclude any practical self-contained 
encoding.   

There is historical precedent for Use Case #2. Systems supporting Vector Product Format 
(VPF) data using FACC and external GeoSym libraries have successfully addressed this 
use case. If the symbology library, the attribute rules were contained within GeoPackage 
extensions, UC2 would be achievable.

OGC 15-122r1

Copyright © 2016 Open Geospatial Consortium 

This use case could also support a self-contained, internal reference (see section 6.2.3).  

6.2 Internal Symbol/Style References 
Internal symbol/style references provide a linkage between a vector feature instance and a 
symbol/style map lookup stored within the GeoPackage, hereafter referred to as in 
internal symbol reference. Internal symbol references refer to resources that are entirely 
self-contained within the GeoPackage and Symbology Extensions. 

Examples of internal references include the use of symbol tables containing sprites and 
SVG rendering instructions within a table that is distinct from the feature table containing 
geospatial position geometry. 

6.2.1 USE CASE #3 Technical Symbology Set (UC3) 
Technical symbologies are characterized by structured symbology lookup schemes that 
may or may not represent a hierarchical structure. Symbology presentation consists of a 
symbology set identifier (such as HSWG-2.0), a Symbol ID and a single control point 
that determines the position of the symbol.  

 Symbology Set Designation 
 Symbol ID 
 Control Point Geometry 

 1 Point 
 

A symbol table consisting of relative position rendering instructions (e.g. PNG or SVG) 
added to the GeoPackage, using a feature table foreign key reference should be adequate 
to meet the requirements of UC3.  

6.2.1.1 UC3 Implications 
The use of external technical symbology libraries introduces external dependencies, but 
does not necessarily eliminate self-contained symbology approaches. If the SVG symbol 
library files where carried as payload within GeoPackage file, and a simple lookup rule is 
applied, self-contained symbology encoding is possible.   

Although open source symbol libraries such as Homeland Security Working Group 
Emergency Response Symbology exist, there is no universal agreement on resource 
identification, or symbol encoding format, although symbol libraries are often expressed 
as PNG image files, SVG files, or font files. 

A GeoPackage extension would be required to encode the symbol set ID and symbol ID 
and associate a feature to a symbol ID. 

The use of an external library eliminates implied or expressed responsibility of rendering 
consistency, placing this responsibility solely within the external symbol library. The use 
of external dependencies maintains the exchange-based model of the GeoPackage 
standard, which hitherto does not address rendering or style.

6.2.2 USE CASE #4 Geometry Styling (UC4) 
Geometry styling is limited to the augmentation of simple feature rendering with line 
style modifiers such as line width, dash pattern, line color, line caps, and line miter 
properties. There has been extensive analysis of the geometry styling use cases, including 
sophisticated composition rules, as captured in the Symbology Encoding Standard. See 
TENET Report on the OGC Symbology Encoding Standard (OGC SE) 
http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=29160. 

6.2.2.1 UC4 Implications 
Geometry styling requires compliant producers to add appropriate style extensions and 
compliant consumers to apply styling rules when rendering geometries.  

The TENET report5 enumerates several limitations of the OGC SE in portraying military 
Alternative Military Layers or AML, as well as hydrographic layers compliant with S-52. 
These limitations include the following. 

 OGC SE does not adequately address complex line styles required to portray 
complex styles, as found in hydrographic layers, such as anchorage areas. The 
report notes that incorporation of standards such as SVG would address this 
problem. 

 OGC SE does not support symbology ‘pivot points’, that is rotation of symbology 
about a reference hot spot positioned along an explicitly defined control point 
geometry. 

 OGC SE does not support feature types that require multiple delineations. It is 
therefore impossible to define feature portrayals that differentiate between 
different delineations. 

 OGC SE is insufficiently aligned to ISO19117, including: 
o PF_FeaturePortrayal uses an attribute to identify the geometry delineation; 

FeatureTypeStyle does not explicitly support this concept. 
o ISO 19117 models portrayal mapping conditions such as scale, lighting 

and display medium using the interface PF_Context attached to a higher 
level interface PF_PortrayalMapping; SE supports scale conditions at the 
level of the FeatureTypeStyle element. 

o A PF_PortrayalRule instance is associated with a single SR_Symbol – a 
composition of other subordinate SR_Symbols and leaf 
SR_SymbolElements; whereas an SE Rule element may consist of 
multiple Symbolizers but these do not support the hierarchical structure of 
SR_Symbol.

6.2.3 USE CASE #5 Feature Type Styling – Internal (UC5) 
Feature Type Styling is characterized by feature style lookup based upon a feature type 
identified in the feature attribute. This is similar to Use Case 2, but does not depend on 
external dependencies. Feature lookup is based upon a feature type or feature ID lookup, 
referenced to an internal feature resource (PNG or SVG). Rendering of the PNG or SVG 
resource is relatively straightforward. 

Unlike UC2, rendering rules for feature type styling do not support feature clustering,  
multiscale rendering,  or Level of Detail (LOD) management.  

6.2.3.1 UC5 Implications 
To support self-contained UC2 symbology, GeoPackage extension(s) would be required 
to encode the attribute encoding rules, the symbol composition rules, and the symbology 
lookup rendering instructions. This would require a significant effort to extend the 
standard, and would require a significant commitment for producers and consumers of 
GeoPackage to properly support this extension. This would represent a significant 
departure from the ‘data exchange only’ approach that characterizes the current 
GeoPackage standard. 

7. Next Steps 

We propose the following next steps: 

 Discuss this proposal in the broader community (outside the SWG itself) to reach 
a consensus on approach. 

 Prioritize the use cases and pursue design and reference implementations of the 
viable use case(s). 

 Establish a separate working group, coordinating with the GeoPackage SWG 
(composed of interested GeoPackage SWG members and other stakeholders) 

 Analyze applicable informative references to apply towards defining a draft 
specification to address viable use cases identified.  

8. Frequently Asked Questions 

Q: Would Symbology Extension(s) to GeoPackage replace Joint Military Symbology 
(JMS) Standards (MILSTD-2525 or NATO APP 6)? 

A: No. External symbol/style references would encode symbol IDs, modifiers and 
amplifying text using standards such as MIL-STD-2525 or NATO APP 6. 

Q: Would Symbology Extension(s) to GeoPackage be limited to Military Symbology 
(JMS) Standards (MILSTD-2525 or NATO APP 6)?

A: No. External symbol/style references may refer to a broad spectrum of problem 
domains, to include weather, law enforcement, homeland security, and military 
applications. Any domain where symbolic or pictographic representation of spatially 
positioned objects is desired are applicable, as long as a suitable encoding of symbol ID 
references can be standardized and resolved as part of the extension specification. 

Q: Would Symbology Extension(s) to GeoPackage contain the symbology rendering 
instructions, or just the minimum information necessary to present a symbolic 
representation of a feature, event, activity or movement? 

A: This would depend on the need to support self-contained symbology (internal 
references) or leverage external resources and rendering mechanisms, such as symbol 
libraries.  

External symbol references rely upon “well-known” symbology sets, with “well-known” 
symbol identifiers, symbol hierarchy, and “presentation modifiers” (text modifiers and 
graphic modifiers in MILSYM vernacular). Such symbology extensions require the 
encoding of the symbol set ID (e.g. MILSTD-2525B-CN1, APP-6A, HSWG-1.0, …) in 
addition to instance-specific information such as symbol ID, modifiers, and text 
annotations. 

Q: Would the resulting Symbology Encoding effort necessarily be limited to 
GeoPackage? 

A: No. The GeoPackage community is highly motivated to address the symbology 
encoding question for GeoPackage, but any resulting symbology encoding specification 
would be applicable to a broad audience, and would not be necessarily limited to 
GeoPackage. 

Q: Would the resulting Symbology Encoding effort necessarily be limited to Simple 
Features geometries? 

A: No. There is sufficient justification to create style definition mechanism that are 
extensible to more complex features, as described in the NVG specification, or 3D 
placemarks as expressed in the OGC KML standard6.  

                                                
6 It is important to understand that KML does NOT encode geospatial feature data. KML encodes 
geospatial geometry portrayal instructions. KML encodes rendering instructions, not feature exchange data.
