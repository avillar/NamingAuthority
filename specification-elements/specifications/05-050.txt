Introduction


This OpenGIS® Interoperability-Program report proposes and executes methods to evaluate the performance of the use of the Geography Markup Language (GML) as encoded in various ways.


The Geography Markup Language [GML] is an increasingly important feature-encoding format for use in interoperable GIS systems.  Unfortunately, the innate text encoding that it uses is both bulky and slow to process.  To help GML realize its potential, its encoding efficiency should be made to be comparable with other commonly used feature-encoding formats, such as ESRI® Shapefile [SHAPE] format.  To this end, OGC has undertaken to test the compactness and system-throughput capacity of GML as encoded in numerous different ways, including binary encoding in BXML [BXML] and BinXML™ [BINXML] and general compression formats such as GZIP [GZIP] and BZIP2 [BZIP2].  The decision of potential GML adopters becomes much easier when they can have both interoperability and efficiency.

6 Encoding formats


It would informative to test the throughput and compactness of a number of feature-encoding formats, including GML-XML, GML-BXML, ESRI® Shapefile, and MapInfo® MIF, both with and without GZIP and BZIP2 compression.  The GML version will be 3.1.1 with the Simple Features [GML-SF] profile.  With binary encoding, we believe that the GML format can be much more competitive with binary formats such as Shapefile in terms of compactness and processing throughput.  MIF is an all-text format, which would be interesting to compare to GML-XML format.


6.1 Binary-encoding formats


BXML [BXML] is a straightforward patent-unencumbered binary-encoding format for XML data which is designed to be easy to implement and for which an open-source C-language reference implementation is freely available [CWXML].  It is also an OGC Discussion Paper.  One of its most important features for our immediate purposes is that it allows lists of floating-point coordinate values to be directly represented as raw-binary arrays.  This provides both compactness and system throughput since converting coordinate values to and from a text representation is surprisingly time-consuming.


BinXML™ is a commercial software product for which Galdos Systems is a reseller.  Galdos can better explain the strengths of BinXML™.


While a direct comparison of BXML and BinXML™ implemented in the same runtime environment would be desirable, CubeWerx does not have the resources or expertise to implement testing for BinXML™ in the scope of the OWS-3 project even if software licenses were provided.  However, an independent BinXML™ implementation in a different software architecture, such as a scripting-language/XML-tool environment relative to CubeWerx's RDBMS/C-language environment would still allow the direct comparison of encoding compactness and would provide an interesting performance characterization of the effectiveness of different encoding methods in the different GML-processing environments as well as a concrete comparison of the architectural approaches overall.


6.2 Data-compression formats


GZIP [GZIP] and BZIP2 [BZIP2] formats do an excellent job of compressing XML data.  In one rough example that was tested, GZIP achieved around an 80% compression rate (one-fifth the original size) and BZIP2 achieved around an 85% rate (one-sixth the original size) with GML data that had no unnecessary whitespace.  Specialized XML compression methods probably cannot out-compress GZIP and BZIP2 significantly in the general case.


However, the encoding and decoding of GZIP and BZIP2 formats are very CPU-intensive, so the “compaction” of the raw information before the “compression” step can have an large impact on overall system performance.  This trade-off is investigated.  Binary encodings of XML are considerably more compact than XML itself.


ZIP [ZIP] and compress [COMPRESS] compression formats are also in general use.  ZIP format does not need to be considered in this investigation because it generally uses exactly the same compression method that GZIP does, called “Deflate”.  It is also not a streamable format which imposes complications in a streaming client/server environment.  The compress method does not achieve as high a compression rate as GZIP (74% compression for the example) and, as it turns out, does not execute as quickly as GZIP, so it does not need to be considered in this study.  Historically, compress executed more efficiently than GZIP, however, use and refinement of the method stagnated for many years because of patent issues.


6.3 Complete format list


The complete list of GML-encoding combinations that should be tested for both compactness and throughput is as follows:

		CubeWerx® MDF

		BZIP2





MDF is an high-performance format used by CubeWerx to load feature data into the Oracle database system.  It is a simple all-binary format in which geometries are stored in OGC Well-Known-Binary [WKB] format and the other properties are stored in fixed-sized fields.


One complication with the Shapefile, MIF, and MDF formats is that they are realized as a collection of multiple files instead of just one file.  The represented size will be the sum of the sizes of the constituent files that contain the equivalent information to GML format.  In a client/server environment, these files would need to be packaged together in an archive format such as ZIP or TAR [TAR], and the packaging requirement limits the potential streamability of the formats since the complete first file in the package must be available before the first record of the subsequent file is streamed out from a server.


For our testing purposes, it is sufficient to test the Shapefile and MIF formats only on a single machine to compare them with GML results on a single machine.  It would be a burden to incorporate these formats into the WFS interface, though it is technically feasible (when combined with a packaging format as mentioned above).


One capability lacking from GML that Shapefile has is that of random access.  BXML and presumably BinXML™ incorporate mechanisms for random access to elements based on identifier attributes, but this is not a spatial index.  A spatial index would be needed to access features spatially as Shapefile and MDF allow, but none is provided by the GML format.


7 Coordinate-value precision


An easy way to achieve data compaction in both the XML and BXML representations of GML data is to reduce the precision of the coordinate values in the features.  Coordinate values are normally represented as double-precision floating-point values in GIS systems and this is equivalent to about 16 significant decimal digits.  However, no real-world data is this accurate and some applications do not even need the full precision of the real data.  Sixteen decimal digits is equivalent to 4.4 nanometers (billionths of a meter) of resolution along the equator of the Earth.


The GML encoding should be tested with both double-precision coordinate values as well as single-precision in order to quantify the increased compactness.  Single precision is equivalent to about seven significant decimal digits or 2.4 meters of resolution along the equator.  BXML encoding has the capability to dynamically select different encodings for XML-Schema [XML-SCHEMA] content identified as “list of double,” such as GML coordinates values.


Intermediate precisions could also be tested.  This is easy to do with XML-encoded GML by selecting any integral number of significant decimal digits, though it is slightly more difficult to achieve with a binary encoding.  Floating-point doubles would best be used for this encoding with the least-significant bits of the mantissas zeroed out.  This data will have the same uncompressed size as with the full double precision, but it will compress better.  CubeWerx does not consider it to be worthwhile to investigate intermediate precisions at this time, though in the future, if systems have metadata about the absolute accuracy of the coorindate values in a feature collection, it could automatically select intermediate precisions individually for each feature type.


There is an indirect benefit to always using full double precision values in all calculations in a distributed system in that most computers implement IEEE 754-1995 [FLOATS] floating-point format in hardware so that most systems will compute similar or identical results and will behave more deterministically when making threshold decisions (e.g., “value >= 1e6”).  However, the increased compactness of using lesser precision in GML data may be a more important benefit.


8 Network environments


Testing should be conducted in the following environments: local file system (single machine), LAN (Local Area Network), Internet, and limited bandwidth (dial-up).


8.1 Local filesystem


It is very important to test GML-encoding performance on a single machine to determine directly and accurately the performance of the different GML encodings in isolation from confounding factors like network delays.  The most scientifically accurate methods should be applied in this experiment and measuring only in a distributed environment would be like measuring the dimensions of a book with a ruler that is marked only in integral feet.  Also, the encoding compactness will be the same as in local case as in the distributed case but will be easier to measure in the local case.  Testing on a local machine will also be necessary to compare against formats like Shapefile on their “home turf”.


8.2 LAN and Internet environments with WFS


GML is normally used to exchange geographic data in the LAN (Local-Area Network) within a single organization and over the Internet between organizations.  The purpose of testing in these network environments, considering that raw performance can be measured in a local-machine environment, is to demonstrate interoperability and to assess whether the raw performance differences are actually significant when combined with the network-transfer and WFS-processing costs of the normal GML usage environment.


The LAN and Internet environments have different performance characteristics and represent the common cases for distributed GML-processing systems.  Compression almost always makes sense in an Internet environment since modern computers can apply GZIP compression to at least 70 Mbits/sec of text GML data, thereby saturating even high-speed Internet links.  However, modern LANs operate at at least 100 Mbits/sec, which imposes a different cost structure on encodings.


8.3 WFS integration


Two methods are available to integrate alternate GML encodings into the WFS interface: the WFS output-format mechanism and the HTTP transfer-encoding mechanism.


The WFS interface provides a mechanism for selecting among different encodings for the feature data that it delivers.  The WFS 1.0.0 specification describes an optional attribute called “outputFormat” on the GetFeature request for which the default value is “GML2” in Section 9.2 on page 25.  The description on the same page also says:


The outputFormat attribute defines the format to use to generate the result set.  The default value is GML2 indicating that GML [2] shall be used.  Vendor specific formats (including non-XML and binary formats), declared in the capabilities document are also possible.  The available types are identified using <ResultFormat> tag of the Capabilities document.


In WFS version 1.1.0, the format identifiers are a little different.  The example in Section 9.2 shows the string as “text/xml; subtype=3.1.1”.  To request BXML, the equivalent would be “application/x-bxml; subtype=3.1.1”.  The Capabilities schema is a little hard to follow, but it looks like the Capabilities tag is <OutputFormatList>.


HTTP [HTTP], which the WFS interface is build on top of, also provides a built-in mechanism for requesting GZIP or compress encoding of the transferred content.  The client can include an “Accept-Encoding” MIME-header tag in the request message and the server has the option of responding with a “Content-Encoding” MIME-header tag in the reply message that indicates that the body is compressed.  The HTTP RFC does not explicitly spell out support for BZIP2 encoding, but it can logically be included by using either “x-bzip2” or even “bzip2” as the encoding-tag value.  The nature of the mechanism makes the use of ad-hoc symbols non-intrusive.  BXML encoding could even be requested in this way.


Since this content-encoding mechanism is built-in and optional, any WFS or WFS client has the option to support it and the data transfer will be optimized wherever possible.  All WFS clients and servers should support at least this mechanism.  Really, CubeWerx finds it rather mind-boggling that any production work would be attempted with GML in the Internet environment without at least using the HTTP mechanism for GZIP compression of the data stream.


8.4 External codec


An external codec is a piece of software that would be placed between a WFS client and server which would accept an XML-encoded GML stream from the WFS server, encode it into an alternate format, transport it to the client site, decode it back into XML-encoded GML and then pass it to the client application.


A general external codec has at least two major problems: it is complicated to implement since it essentially would be a distributed, cascading WFS; it is inefficient since it requires the parsing and generation of the GML data not once but three times, including two times as XML-encoded GML, which would most likely render it less efficient than directly GZIP-compressing a plain XML-encoded GML stream using the HTTP mechanism.


8.5 Limited-bandwidth network


A limited bandwidth environment can serve as a guide for wireless and dial-up cases where limited facilities are available.  A suitable speed it 56 kbps.  The general compression methods are expected to have the most significant impact in this environment, since the crucial performance factor will be minimizing the bandwidth usage.


9 Scalability


The scalability of GML data and processing systems should also be investigated.  This can be done easily using small, medium, and large data sets of the representative geometry types: points, lines, and polygons.  The testing definition of a ‘large’ data set is one with approximately 1-million features.


A GML-processing system based on utilizing a DOM (Document Object Model) approach to XML processing will have its scalability inherently limited to the number of features that can be stored in machine memory at one time, so GML-processing systems should not be based strictly on the DOM methodology.  Systems based on XSLT [XSLT] tools will have the same scalability problems for the same reason.


CubeWerx anticipates no inherent scalability problems with either the representation of or processing of a large number of GML features in its GML-processing systems.  The CWXML [CWXML] open-source library utilized by CubeWerx provides a node/subtree mechanism that supplies the convenience of a DOM mechanism with the scalability of  the streamable SAX mechanism.


Since the sponsor-supplied MSD3 data totals only in the thousands of features, VMAP0 data is used to conduct scalability testing.


10 Testing approach and environment


10.1 Sample application


The two kinds of “performance” to be measured in the GML Performance Investigations are system throughput (speed) and information-encoding compactness.  To test throughput, the various software levels of a representative GML-processing application are measured in a number of usage environments.  The compactness can be determined by measuring the size of the same GML feature data as encoded and compressed by the various different means.


A representative GML-processing application is the fetching and rendering of a stream of GML data into a displayable image.  The application has the following software levels which can be characterized independently and in combination:


· fetch features from underlying system


· generate features in GML


· transport features


· parse features into internal programming-language structures


· render features into raster


Feature rendering is not strictly necessary for measuring GML performance, but it provides concrete visible proof that all of the features of a data set were actually processed and it supplies an interesting comparison of the performance of two different architectures for SLD [SLD] styling that have been pursued by OGC participants: native implementation vs. XML tools.  Most GIS-product vendors including CubeWerx use the native-implementation approach.  Galdos uses an XML-tools approach.  Proponents have long advocated the benefits of each approach.  Also, the software to render features is already available in the testing environments anyway, and the timing of the rendering component can easily be computed and factored out of the GML-transfer components.


10.2 Test data


An MSD3 data set was supplied by the project sponsors which is defined relative to a large central XML Schema and some VMAP0 data was selected by the participants since it has more bulk for reliable testing and it has small schemas.  The VMAP0 data selected is described in clause 11 and the MSD3 data is described in clause 12.


10.3 Testing methodology


The general measuring methodology employed is to run each test case four times and discard the first run and average the subsequent three.  The first run may involve variable system-caching overheads that would be difficult to measure reliably.  In some cases, it is not feasible to perform four runs of every combination because it would take too long.


All time measurements are for real elapsed “wall-clock” time.  This is the time of principal concern to most users.  (Other conceivable timing measurements include CPU-processing time.)


All figures for file sizes, transfer speeds, use SI unit-multiplier prefixes, which are normally base-10 [SI] but include a special notation for base-2 [SI-BIN].  For example, 1 KB means exactly 1,000 bytes and 1 KiB means exactly 1,024 bytes.

The following tools are be used in the testing:


· cwcat – simple command-line file copier


· cwdump – simple command-line feature-file displayer/copier


· cwplot – simple command-line feature-file plotter with SLD support


· xmlscan – simple command-line XML file copier/converter


· CWXML – XML/BXML parser/generator library


· CubeSERV® WFS – Oracle®-based Web Feature Service


· gzip – open-source compression library


· bzip2 – open-source compression library


The cwcat program is modeled after the Unix® cat program but has special features including the capability to read from remote URLs (as do all of the “cw” programs) and to limit the throughput of the data it copies.  This latter feature is used to simulate Internet and dial-up networks as described in clause 10.7.


The cwdump program includes the capability to generate GML data in a CGI environment and this capability is used to implement the simulated high-performance WFS that is used for some test cases.  The implementation is described in clause 10.8.


The xmlscan program is included with the open-source CWXML library and is handy for reformatting and ‘pretty printing’ XML/BXML data.


Version 1.2.3 of the gzip compression library is used.  The maximum compression level of ‘9’ is used since the library can produce data at this compression level much faster than the LAN can absorb it, so it is better to maximize the amount of compression.  Recent versions of this library include significant performance improvements over older versions.  The library-default compression level is ‘6’.


Version 1.0.3 of the bzip2 compression library is used.  The bzip2 compression level of ‘9’ is used, which is the maximum and the library default.


10.6 Local-file-system testing


Reading-speed testing was performed by using a script that translates the source data from the GML-XML distribution format into the format to be tested and then reads the data four times in a loop.  After the first read, the file content will be cached in memory, assuming that it fits, and subsequent reads show be as efficient as the format allows.


Writing-speed testing was performed using the same approach as the reading testing, except that the time taken to read from the source-data format (uncompressed GML encoded in XML) is subtracted from the total read+write time, giving only the writing time.


10.7 Network simulation


Early Internet testing was attempted using the real Internet, but the results were far too variable minute-by-minute and day-by-day to produce results that were actually comparable to each other.  Instead, this testing is carried out using the CubeWerx internal 100-Mbps LAN with the server CGI shell-script program augmented to pass the outgoing data through cwcat used as a precise flow-controlling filter.  This filter is so light-weight that it does not influence the results and its operation closely simulates what happens with normal Internet transfers: the outgoing data from the generator program gets queued up in the outgoing socket buffers until the generator process is suspended while the data is slowly emptied onto the outgoing network connection.


The data rate selected for Internet testing is 150 Kbytes/sec, which represents a decent Internet connection between any two points in North America or perhaps the world.  Because of the structure of the interaction as a small request with a single large reply, it is not necessary to simulate packet latency (ping times) since TCP/IP is a sliding-window protocol that quite effectively hides packet latency for large transfers, but a 60-millisecond latency is added on the server side anyway.


The data rate selected for Dial-up testing is 5.6 Kbytes/sec, which corresponds to 56 Kbits/sec uncompressed.  A response latency of 200 milliseconds is inserted on the server side.


The LAN used is a lightly loaded 100-Mbps Ethernet system with the server and laptop client directly connected to the network.  Pinging the server from the client takes an average of 0.141 milliseconds and the sustained HTTP data-transfer rate is 11.70 MB/second.


10.8 WFS simulation


CubeWerx had insufficient time to fully integrate the needs of the MSD3 data into the CubeSERV transactional WFS, so a light-weight simulated WFS was implemented with this capability by building on the cwdump feature-displaying utility.  This utility is so efficient that it serves a second important purpose which is to determine what transfer costs are caused by the network as opposed to the relational-database system used by the full-feature WFS.  As it turns out, the RDBMS is quite costly.


The simulated WFS has a simple CGI interface and it  reads features from BXML-encoded GML files stored on the server and it recodes them on the fly according to the received request into XML or BXML encoding with GZIP, BZIP2, or no compression.  In the case that uncompressed BXML is requested, the full re-coding process is still carried out for timing consistency.  The returned GML data references a schema which is also generated by the web application on request to be encoded in the same way as the GML data for the VMAP0 test data and which is copied directly from a pre-encoded schema file on the server for MSD3 data.  These methods correspond to the way these data sets would normally be used, since the MSD3 data is defined relative to a fixed central schema.


For example, the following request for XML+GZIP:


http://a64.cubewerx.com/ows3/simfs/simfs.cgi?REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=builtupa&OUTPUTFORMAT=text/xml%3Bencoding%3Dgzip


will reference its schema as:


http://a64.cubewerx.com/ows3/simfs/simfs.cgi?REQUEST=DescribeFeatureType&TYPENAME=builtupa&OUTPUTFORMAT=text/xml%3Bencoding%3Dgzip


The testing carried out is only to fetch and internally plot the requested data using the cwplot application, excluding the time taken to write out the resulting PNG image from the internal raster representation.  The features received at the client are not stored; each is discarded immediately after plotting.


Thus, the execution time will include reading and re-coding the source data on the server, transferring it over the network, parsing the data into internal C-language feature representations, and plotting it into a C-language raster representation.  The translation from GML to internal the C-language structures provides a means of validating the data in terms of properties and data types, though this is a different from from XML-Schema-based validation.


The plotting speed turns out to be so fast that plotting adds virtually no overhead to the process, so it is safe to include here.  Also, the data is fully streamed, so if the client can process the data more quickly than the network can deliver it, the client operations will effectively have no cost.  The same is true of the server if it can supply the data faster than the network can absorb it.


11 VMAP0-data testing


The following feature collections from the VMAP0 data are used for testing, in order of the number of features per collection:


		Collection

		Description

		Geom Type

		Properties

		Features

		Vertices



		builtupa

		Built-up Areas

		Polygon

		6

		8,346

		17.3



		inwatera

		Inland Water Bodies

		Polygon

		6

		153,358

		19.2



		elevp

		Elevation Points

		Point

		8

		175,880

		1.0



		watrcrsl

		Water Courses

		LineString

		6

		290,528

		8.9



		coutourl

		Contour Lines

		LineString

		7

		1,099,837

		30.7





The terms “feature type” and “feature collection” can be used interchangeably here, since each feature collection includes features of exactly one type.  The “Properties” column gives the number of properties in the features; the “Features” column gives the number of features in each feature collection; and the “Vertices” column gives the average number of vertices in the geometry of each feature, which indicates how complex the geometries are.  (The start/end point of a polygon ring is counted as two vertices.)  This data set includes feature-collection sizes of medium volume to large volume.  The contourl feature collection is suitable for demonstrating the scalability of the processing applications.


The source VMAP0 geometries have single-precision coordinate values, so versions of the elevp and watrcrsl feature collections were created that have double-precision coordinate values for comparison purposes.  Use of the double-precision versions is specifically noted.

11.1.1.1 Reading


The reading results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows:


		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)

		Time (s)

		Speed (F/s)



		GML

		XML

		none

		6.17

		0.533

		15,659



		GML

		XML

		7.41

		0.547

		15,258



		GML

		BXML

		none

		2.44

		0.151

		55,272



		GML

		XML

		gzip

		1.15

		0.592

		14,098



		GML

		XML

		indented + gzip

		1.16

		0.609

		13,704



		GML

		BXML

		1.07

		0.183

		45,607



		GML

		0.882

		9,463



		GML

		BXML

		bzip2

		1.053

		0.404

		20,658





The compression type indicated as “indented” is not compression at all but means that the text file was “pretty printed” with an indentation of two spaces for each XML-tag level.  As expected, it makes the uncompressed version of the file significantly large; however, it does not add significantly to the gzip-compressed size or time.  This extra whitespace compresses very well.


In general, the GZIP compression/decompression method operates faster than expected.  It will likely be made faster still in the future when certain hashing-table patents expire.


We fixed a performance bug in the BXML parser during the course of this testing that caused it to unnecessarily convert numeric property values to text before re-converting them back to numbers for the reading application.  This resulted in a 40% performance increase.


The GML reader is not that heavily optimized.  It uses the node/subtree interface of the CWXML library, which reads in DOM-like subtrees for each feature but only holds one feature in memory at a time.  In contrast, the GML writer uses a node-by-node approach and its performance of 117,549 given below shows how much faster that approach can be.  The node-subtree approach is easier to program for reading, however, and some modest optimization attempts showed that reading features is harder to optimize than writing them.


11.1.1.2 Reading alternate formats


The reading results for the builtupa feature collection represented in alternative formats to GML are as follows:


		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)

		Time (s)

		Speed (F/s)



		Shapefile

		(binary+text)

		none

		3.70

		0.047

		178,143



		MIF

		(text)

		none

		3.25

		0.249

		33,558



		MDF

		(binary)

		none

		3.62

		0.031

		267,819





The relevant comparison here is to GML encoded in BXML at 55.3 kF/s and XML at 15.7 kF/s.  The MIF text format can be processed twice as fast as XML-encoded GML and Shapefile can be processed 3.2 times as fast as BXML-encoded GML.  This is a little surprising and disappointing, given that Shapefile numeric properties are actually stored in a text representation.  CubeWerx MDF format performs 4.9 times as fast as BXML-encoded GML.  It should also be noted that both Shapefile and MDF formats always store coordinate values as double-precision floats, but they still out-perform BXML-encoded GML.


The processing performance of these alternate formats when compressed was not tested, but the compressed sizes were measured as follows:


		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)



		Shapefile

		(binary+text)

		gzip

		1.45



		Shapefile

		(binary+text)

		bzip2

		1.25



		MIF

		(text)

		gzip

		1.02



		MIF

		(text)

		bzip2

		0.94



		MDF

		(binary)

		gzip

		1.49



		MDF

		(binary)

		bzip2

		1.17





The compressed sizes are comparable to but not quite as good as the GML compressed sizes, except for MIF format, which is more compact in all cases.


11.1.1.3 Writing


The writing results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows:


		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)

		Time (s)

		Speed (F/s)



		GML

		6.17

		3.000

		2,782



		GML

		BXML

		bzip2

		1.053

		0.791

		10,551





The reported timings for the writing speed are reduced by the 0.533 seconds taken to read the source builtupa data.  There is quite a spike in the performance of the uncompressed BXML case, since this format is very efficient to write.


11.1.1.4 Plotting


The plotting results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows:


		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)

		Time (s)

		31,855





The plotting window is between longitudes -180 and 0 and latitudes -40 to 90 and is size 3600 pixels horizontal by 2600 vertical and the output image type is PNG.  The writing time of the PNG file is excluded from the time.  The SLD styling symbol uses a light-pink fill (#EEA9B8) with a dark-pink outline (#FFC0CB).  A scaled down version (to reduce document size) of the resulting image is included here:




The data is rather sparse, but this test demonstrates that the full North American coverage has been processed in our testing.


If we eliminate the GML-data-reading time, the internal plotting time is only around 0.080 seconds for a speed of around 104,000 features per second.  While this performance is not strictly what is to be measured in this experiment, it would be very interesting to see how well a GML-XSLT-SVG plotting system performs.  We suspect not as well.  A system needs to be fast at plotting features in order to offer an effective WMS interface.

The GML-XML-uncompressed case likely includes file-cache-miss effects, since the file size is just short of the amount of physical memory on the machine, but the effect is most likely not significant, since the performance is consistent with the GML-XML-gzip case.


11.1.7.2 Writing

		6,842





The reported timings for the writing speeds are reduced by the 77.809 seconds taken to read the source contourl data.


These results most likely include file-cache-miss effects.  However, this effect appears to be limited, since if the testing tool is limited to processing only the first 200,000 features (which will fit into the file-cache memory), the feature throughput is only about 4.5% faster.

The plotting window covers the whole world and the image is 3600 pixels across by 1800 (with a scaled-down version included here).  The SLD plotting style uses brown strokes (#808000):


The raw internal plotting speed is around 254,000 features per second.


11.1.8 Conclusions


Uncompressed BXML provided the fastest reading, writing, and plotting performances for local file-system testing.  This is the expected result.  Averaging the single-precision test cases, BXML format files were only 40% as large as the uncompressed-XML files; they were read 4.0 times as fast for an average of 71,606 features/second; and they were written 8.2 times as fast for an average of 117,760 features/second.


Using compression in the local file system just slows down the performance.  This would only be recommended to conserve space.  The compressed file sizes between BXML and XML are quite similar, but the compressed BXML files could be read and written much faster than the compressed XML files.


Using double precision coordinate values produces files that are significantly larger and take significantly more time to process.  This is as expected.


The BXML encoding of GML falls far short of the reading performance of Shapefile and CubeWerx MDF formats.  Shapefile, the golden standard, can be read an average of 3.0 times as fast as the BXML-encoded GML format.


The plotting performance of the CubeWerx SLD renderer is astonishingly high.

There are competing factors in the determination of the performance in this environment: the encoding, the compressing and decompressing, and the network bandwidth.  The network in this case is fairly high in bandwidth and compression is fairly expensive.  The client-side CPU utilization showed up as being between 8% and 43%, with the former for uncompressed data and the latter for bzip2-compressed data.

It is interesting that the XML+gzip case is faster than the XML-uncompressed case, as opposed to most other feature types where the uncompressed data is faster.  In this case, the GML file contains a much greater amount of redundancy than the other feature types since the quasi-random coordinate data occupies a much smaller portion of the file and the XML tags a much greater portion.  The file ends up being compressed to such a degree that the faster transfer speed improves the overall performance.  Or, it could be that the GZIP compressor is disproportionately slow at compressing quasi-random numbers.

11.2.8 Conclusions


Uncompressed BXML still gives the best performance in the LAN environment with the simulated WFS, performing an average of 2.8 times as fast as XML encoding over the seven test cases.


Gzip compression is much more competitive in this environment and was actually faster than uncompressed data in a couple of instances.  Bzip2 compression is still too CPU-bound to be competitive in this environment.


11.3 LAN testing with relational-database WFS

These results are somewhat disappointing and show that accessing a relational database incurs a substantial time overhead.  The close similarity of all the timings regardless of encoding format show that accessing this data from the database has a fixed cost of around 25 seconds relative to a few seconds of difference for processing the different encodings, rendering the encoding unimportant in this environment.

There are competing factors in the determination of the performance in this environment: the encoding, the compressing and decompressing, and the network bandwidth.  The network in this case is fairly low in bandwidth and compression is relatively inexpensive, so file size is the major determinate of performance.


One would need to be crazy not to compress GML data being sent over the Internet.

The XML+bzip2 case may seem anomalously slow, but this is what was reliably measured.  The major factor would be the bulkiness of the data input to the expensive bzip2-compression algorithm.

The simulated high-performance network is efficient enough to saturate the network in all cases except for using bzip2 compression, but it comes close even then.


11.4.8 Conclusions


Compression is the most important factor in this test environment.  Since the compressed sizes of BXML and XML are quite similar, the performance was also quite similar.  Using bzip2 compression frequently gave the best performance, though bzip2 applied to XML was substantially slower than the other encodings since BXML is slow to execute and XML gives the compression method a bulky input stream.

The network was the bottleneck in the uncompressed-XML test case but retrieving the features from the database was the bottleneck in the rest of the cases.  The throughput was about 145 kbytes/sec in the uncompressed-XML case but only 93 kbytes/sec in the uncompressed-BXML test case (significantly less than the network bandwidth).  Applying compression increases the elapsed time since retrieving features from the database is already a CPU-intensive activity, and compression adds to the CPU-power bottleneck.  The XML+bzip2 test case achieves a network utilization of only 33 kbytes/sec.  The other feature types below follow a similar pattern.

11.5.8 Conclusions


Using a relational database shows less overhead in the Internet environment, though full network utilization is not achieved for the non-uncompressed-XML test cases.  The other encodings are compact enough that the CPU and database access on the server is the bottleneck.


11.6 Dial-up testing


This testing was carried out using the same simulated method as with the Internet testing.  In this case, the link speed was set to 5,600 bytes/second to correspond to a 56-kbit/second low-speed link.  No built-in compression was simulated over the link.

Transferring any volume of data over the link is obviously very slow and is completely dominated by the link speed.  The CPU utilization on the client was shown as 0% to 2%.


Very limited plotting performance was measured for the inwatera feature collection:

		7.13





This test case ran for approximately six hours.


11.6.2 Extrapolated results


The testing for the dial-up case is extremely time-consuming and the results have been demonstrated to be determined by the link speed, so presented here is an extrapolation of the testing of all seven feature collections being concatenated together (2,194,357 features):


		Format

		Encoding

		43.74





If all these test cases were executed once in practice, it would take over seven days.


11.6.3 Conclusions


Dial-up links are very slow, so the GML encoding with the greatest compression will have the highest throughput.  In this case, bzip2 gives the best compression and therefore, the best throughput.  The bzip2 file sizes are slightly smaller for XML than BXML, so XML+bzip2 gives the best throughput.


12 MSD3-data testing


It would not be feasible or greatly useful to perform manual testing on all of the individual feature types, so four instances were chosen for manual testing to represent the MSD3 data set: three feature collections of varying geometry type plus an aggregation of all the feature types.  The aggregation was obtained simply by concatenating together all of the <gml:featureMember> elements of the supplied GML feature collections.  The schema references were also changed to be locally available and offered up with the different encodings of the test instances (e.g., XML, BXML, compressed).  The source data is all three-dimensional, but two-dimensional versions are also tested.


The following feature collections from the MSD3 data are used for testing:


		Collection

		Description

		Geom Type

		Properties

		Features

		Vertices



		MSD3

		MSD3 Aggregate

The “Properties” column gives the average number of properties per feature present in the MSD3 collection, excluding the topology property (since it is not processed).  The “Vertices” column is the average number of vertices per geometry for all feature collections.


Two versions of the MSD3 schema were available for testing: the full version and a version with all of the <appinfo> metadata trimmed out of it.  The major reporting of results is for the trimmed version of the schema with additional comments about the performance with the full schema.


The testing of 3D coordinate values versus 2D coordinate values is reported only for the MSD3-aggregation feature collection.  The performance difference between 2D and 3D is not that large and the aggregation case shows the difference sufficiently.


12.1 Local file-system testing


The GML and schema files were tested using local files.


12.1.1 MSD3 aggregation, 3D


The MSD3 aggregate feature collection has the following appearance when plotted with translucent fills and no feature-type-specific styling:

Parsing the schema takes a significant amount of the elapsed time.  The schema is supplied with in the same encoding and compression format as the GML data.  The parsing time for the trimmed and full MSD3 schemas are as follows, with schema sizes in KB and parsing times in seconds:

The source-data reading time of 1.621 seconds is subtracted from the write timings above.  Note that no new schema file is written out here since the generated GML data refers to a preexisting schema file.


The XML encodings of the compressed data are significantly smaller than the BXML versions.  This is likely because BXML format compacts the data with the primary goal being for speed of processing whereas GZIP and BZIP2 formats compact data with the primary goal being minimization of size.

There does not appear to be a great performance advantage in using 2D coordinates over 3D ones.  This is presumably because the extra coordinate dimension takes a relatively small amount of space compared to all of the attributes.  The difference would be larger if the geometries in the MSD3 data included significantly more vertices.

As discussed with the MSD3-aggregate case, parsing the schema takes a substantial amount of the elapsed time.  However, since this feature collection is much smaller and the schema-parsing time is fixed for each different encoding, schema parsing now takes the majority of the elapsed time.

12.1.6 Conclusions


Uncompressed BXML encoding gives the best performance in the local-file-system test case.  Since the MSD3 3D case actually includes the data for the other test cases, it is the most representative one.  The BXML format was 1.85 times as fast as XML and was only 53% as large for using the trimmed schema.


A large performance factor with this data is the schema, since it is so large relative to the data.  Two versions were tested, a trimmed version and the full version which includes a great deal of metadata.  Both versions include definitions for hundreds of feature types that are not present in the test data set.


The BXML version of the trimmed schema is 43% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.34 times as fast.  The BXML version of the full schema is 46% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.88 times as fast.  Parsing the trimmed schema takes 27% of the BXML execution time.


Compression gives poor performance in this environment because the compression algorithms are slow to execute.  However, if storage size is the crucial restriction, then XML+bzip2 gives the best compression, though it is much slower to execute than gzip compression.


The BXML compressed files are substantially larger than the XML compressed file.  The reason for this is not known.


Processing 2D data versus 3D data did not make a substantial difference in either the processing time or the file size.  This is likely because the features have relatively few vertices per geometry and have a large number of properties, so the extra coordinate in the 3D data does not take a substantial amount of extra space.


12.2 LAN testing


The BXML format includes a central symbol table and a mechanism to make any text content reference a string in this table.  The advantage is that a literal string value need appear in the BXML file only once and it can be referenced by a compact index value thereafter.  The option is enabled in the BXML generator for the MSD3 network cases to make all generated content strings use this central symbol table for greater compactness.  


The reason this option was not enabled in the file-system testing is that there appears to be a performance bug in the CWXML library that makes processing referenced strings a little slower than literal strings.  However, in the network environment, the increased compactness of the volume of data sent over the network provides better performance than using the literal strings.

12.2.6 External codec


An external codec (encoder-decoder, external to the main GML-consuming program) was added to the LAN testing script by adding a Unix shell statement of the form:


  xmlscan -url data_url -pack | cwplot -f - parameters


This executes the xmlscan program which reads the GML data from the server as a separate process from the cwplot program which plots the data.  The xmlscan program reads the data in whatever format is requested from the server but always delivers it to the cwplot program as uncompressed XML, so this arrangement operates as an “external codec” for delivering GML data to a client application that does not understand BXML or the compression formats.  A caveat is that it would be very awkward to intercept the retrieval of the schemas, so only the GML data is subjected to the external codec, not the schema access.  Also, this external codec is implemented only on the client side; the external codec could be extended onto the server side as discussed in clause 8.4 which would impose greater costs and complications for recognizing and translating coordinate values and other numbers.


This arrangement is functionality equivalent to the direct MSD3 test, except the external codec will create more execution overhead on the client from managing multiple processes and in interprocess pipe and from executing an extra decoding and encoding step.  Additionally, the extra encoding step will be for regular XML and the decoding step inside of the cwplot program will always be for regular XML-encoded GML.


The plotting results for the MSD3 3D feature collection using the external codec are as follows (sizes in KB, times in seconds, speeds in features/second):

The results show that the use of an external codec imposes significant throughput costs in the Internet environment and the benefits of using BXML in this environment are largely nullified.  The lost performance would be significantly larger if the schema fetching was also run through an external codec.


Note that the XML-none figure does not really belong here since the main application in this arrangement can consume regular XML directly, so an external codec is not really needed in this case.


12.2.7 Conclusions


The uncompressed BXML encoding gives the best performance in the LAN test case, same as with the VMAP0 data.  The BXML format was 2.2 times as fast as XML and was only 28% as large for using the trimmed schema.  Using the symbol-table BXML mechanism makes the BXML files substantially smaller here than in the file-system testing where it was turned off.


Schema processing is a large factor with the MSD3 data.  The BXML verison of the trimmed schema is 26% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.59 times as fast.  The BXML version of the full schema is 28% as large as the XML version and can be processed 2.5 times as fast.  Parsing the trimmed schema takes 20% of the BXML execution time.  The schemas compress extremely well.


Compression performs better in this environment than in the file-system environment because there is a trade-off between processing time taken to compress the data and the effectively increased network throughput of the compressed data.  However, the LAN is fast enough that the processing time is more costly.  The BXML compressed data files are substantially larger than the XML compressed file.  The reason for this is not known.


Using an external codec adds a substantial overhead in this environment and tends to even out the timings because of the large fixed overhead of the fixed XML-GML generate/parse steps.

The results here are quite different from the LAN test case.  The primary difference is that in this case, the client CPU is largely idle in the direct-connection case, so the resources are readily available to execute the external codec and while keeping up with the server.  There is no obvious explanation for why the uncompressed cases actually experience performance improvements, though there may be some subtle effects in the network-simulation implementation.


The cases where the performance is significantly worse is probably related to the fixed overhead of executing the decode-generate-decode steps on the client.  The break-even point seems to be around the 14-second period of the XML-bzip2 case, though in this case, the server would be very busy executing the expensive bzip2-compression algorithm.  Indeed, in this case, the server can only generate 37 kbytes/sec over the simulated 150-kbyte/sec link.  The server is nearly able to saturate the link in the gzip test cases, and so would deliver the maximum concentration of features per second.  In the uncompressed cases, the network is the bottleneck, so the number of features per second that the client needs to process is restricted.


12.3.7 Conclusions


Compression is crucial to performance in the Internet environment because of the limited network bandwidth.  However, while bzip2 compression gives the greatest compactness, gzip gives the better throughput.


The XML+gzip case gives the best throughput in this environment.  The portion time taken parsing the schema is substantially lower in this environment than in the LAN environment because the schemas compress incredibly well.


Using an external codec adds greatly less overhead than in the LAN environment because the client machine has much more idle time while waiting for data to come from the network that it can spend on the fixed cost of the fixed XML-GML generate/parse steps.


12.4 Dial-up testing


Dial-up testing is carried out using a simulated 5.6-kbyte/sec uncompressed link.

12.4.6 Conclusions


With a dial-up link, compression is crucial to performance.  Whatever encoding method produces the fewest bytes to represent a feature collection will be the fastest, pretty much regardless of how much processing the encoding method takes.  In the case of the MSD3 data, the best encoding method for dial-up links is XML+bzip2.


13 GML issues


In the course of carrying out this performance study, some problem areas with using GML were identified.


13.1 The trouble with application schemas


There are two general approaches to handling the schemas associated with GML data.  One way is to auto-generate a custom-tailored schema for each GML file that is generated from the information available from the source feature format, as was done for the VMAP0 test data set, and the other way is to use an external, centralized schema, as was done for the MSD3 test data set.


Using a custom-tailored schema is the approach taken with most other feature formats, with the schema information normally embedded within the data file(s).  A vulnerability with this approach is the fidelity with which the schema information is carried from one representation to another.  Sometimes, the sizes of properties or letter case of names are changed, and most feature formats have tricky idiosyncrasies.  For example, in Shapefile format, numeric types are actually stored as strings, and a numeric type with width=9 and scale=3 can actually store any number that can be represented in nine characters.  Some tools even write numbers in scientific notation.


Using the centralized-schema approach has problems also.  One major problem is that the centralized schema may include a great number of feature-type definitions and a great deal of metadata that is not relevant to the purpose at hand.  For example, the MSD3 central schema includes definitions for 443 different feature types even though the sponsor-supplied data includes only 93 feature types and 83% of the bulk of the full schema contains metadata which is not relevant to the performance-testing activities of the OWS-3 project.  The schema is so large that parsing it takes a significant portion of the time to read the MSD3 data and it even takes the majority of the time for smaller feature collections.


The other major problem with centralized application schemas is that it is easy to include arbitrary formatting declarations that general-purpose GML client and server applications cannot understand or follow.  This problem is present with custom-generated schemas also, though the arbitrariness is limited in practice to the types of declarations that are portable between common representation formats.  For instance, if the data is held in a relational-database format using simple types (plus a geometry), then the generated schema will reflect this simplicity.


Handling arbitrary schema declarations may be an unsolvable computing problem in the general case and is at least a complex artificial-intelligence problem since in order for a computer to transform data from one representation into an arbitrary new one, it needs to “understand” the semantics of the information, and arbitrary semantics probably are not representable in a declarative way.


Schema-processing in the centralized-schema approach is particularly onerous because the schema theoretically needs to be parsed and understood in order to even write the GML data correctly, whereas with the custom-generated schema approach the GML writer is easily and statically preprogrammed to generate its output GML in accordance with the schema that it generates.  In practice, however, vendors will not implement a capability to “understand” the schema of the GML data they are writing; they will instead simply implement application-specific hacks into their GML generators to handle any arbitrariness in the application schemas.


It is also possible to implement any arbitrary transformations needed for generated data using a hand-made application-specific transformation script as a post-processing step and to do the reverse in the same way on the client side.  However, beyond the manual effort involved in creating and managing the transformation programs to service all of the different feature types in a data set, portable transformation programs are generally written in XSLT, which, given the way that XSLT operates, is likely to be inefficient and may not work at all for large feature sets like the Contour Lines of the VMAP0 test data since XSTL implementations tend to store the entire XML stream in memory, which also imposes streamability limitations.  It is theoretically possible to optimize XSLT to behave in a streamable fashion where the transformation to be carried out permits, but this optimization is not yet available in real-world XSLT implementations, but even if it is available, the XML stream still needs to be parsed and generated an additional time.


However, there is a fairly easy way around the problems of dealing with arbitrary XML schemas, which is to use simplified canonical profiles of GML and XML-Schema, such as the GML Simple-Features Profile [GML-SF].  If both the application schema and the GML generator conform to the profile (or specific compliance level of future versions of the profile), and if the source format for the generator retains the typing information of the schema with the full fidelity of the schema profile, then the generated GML will always conform to the central application schema.


13.2 GML MeasureType


A practical problem with gml:MeasureType is that the attributes take a fairly large amount of space in the GML data files, whereas the measurement unit for individual properties all appear to be constant in the MSD3 data.  It would be much more space-efficient if the if the fixed unit associated with each measurement property in the MSD3 data could be specified once in the schema definition or metadata rather than being repeated in-line with every property instance.


The presence of the attribute on every property instance also imposes the need on consumers to re-map and retain this information for every measurement property instance when the data is transformed into another feature format in order to maintain the fidelity of the data, since the consumer will not know in advance (or really, ever) that the unit is actually fixed.  This information may be awkward to re-map and will be time- and space-consuming in other feature representations.  This author is not aware of any other format that includes a variable-unit mechanism.


13.3 GML streamability


A format is “streamable” if it can be generated, transfered, and consumed without any undue storage between the end points.  Streamability is desirable because it minimizes processing delays and storage costs throughout the system.  However, there are a few features of GML that interfere with its streamability.


13.3.1 Mid-stream errors


A GML feature collection can include features from numerous different feature types and the WFS interface allows requests to be made for multiple feature types and this can cause streamability issues on the server side since many systems implement the storage of features of different types using a separate internal feature collection for each different type.  Also, all OWS requests require the response to be either a valid document of the requested format or to be a specially coded exception report.


The way that a query that includes multiple feature types is normally implemented is to process the feature-type queries in order and generate the GML output.  But this poses a big problem if any errors are encountered in the intermediate steps, since if any errors are encountered at any point during the GML-generation process, an exception report must be generated instead of a GML document.  GML includes no mechanism for reporting an error after the generation of the stream has begun.


In order for a generating application to be (mostly) safe is to generate all of the output data to a temporary file and then copy this file to the network, but then the generation time is wasted.  This problem is compounded in the Internet environment because the network is usually the bottleneck and it will be idle while the temporary file is generated.  


Really, the only sane approach for WFS implementers is to cheat in some way.


13.3.2 Bounding envelope


The requirement that the bounding envelope be stated at the beginning of a feature stream is desirable for clients, but it imposes restrictions on streamability for servers.  The only way to be sure that the tightest envelope is stated in the general case is to pre-scan all of the features according to all of the query constraints.


13.3.3 Feature interleaving


Another streamability issue is that features in a GML feature collection may appear in any order and be mixed together.  This poses no problems for GML generators since they can choose any order which is convenience, but it does pose problems for GML consumers since many client applications cannot process a sequence of more than one feature type at a time.  If only one feature type is in a stream, a clever client with the one-feature-type-at-a-time constraint can process it in one pass, but this is not possible if more than one feature type is present in the stream.  The client would need to either store or re-retrieve the stream when it is ready to process the next feature type.


GML should include some mechanism to indicate whether or not the features of a type are contiguous and/or appear in the order of the feature types in the schema.  This would allow simple applications to process a GML stream one feature-type at a time in one pass.


14 Conclusions


14.1 Local file-system testing


Testing in the local file system showed that binary encoding using BXML was around four times as fast for reading and eight times as fast for writing GML data compared to XML for the VMAP0 test data.  The performance figures for the MSD3 data showed a lower overall improvement because the parsing of the bulky application schema is conflated with the data encode/decode speeds.  When factored out, the BXML reading is about twice as fast and the writing is about three times as fast.  The MSD3 data has many more properties than the VMAP0 data.


We also need to be cognizant in general that the CWXML parser is extremely well optimized for scanning XML and BXML realized in other environments may be even more efficient than comparable XML parsers since the BXML format is quite easy to process efficiently.


The BXML files are around 40% the size of the XML files and can be smaller still if space-saving options are enabled, and there are design tweaks that can be applied to future versions of BXML to increase compactness.  When compression is applied, the BXML files are frequently around the same size as the XML files, though sometimes the BXML files can be significantly larger, as with the MSD3 data files.  The XML encoding of MSD3 has the advantage that the source data is rounded to ten significant decimal digits, but these are not round values when represented in binary, which reduces the compressibility of the BXML representation.  The compressed BXML files are still substantially faster to process than the compressed XML files, especially with the relatively efficient GZIP method.


Using double-precision coordinate values with the VMAP0 data produced files that were significantly larger and slower to process than using single-precision coordinates.  However, using 2D coordinate values instead of 3D coordinate values with the MSD3 data did not make a significant difference in size or processing speed, likely because the coordinate values occupy a relatively small portion of the overall MSD3-data size.


The BXML encoding of GML falls far short of the performance available with other feature-file formats.  Shapefile can be read about three times faster than BXML-encoded GML.


14.2 LAN testing


The speed and size savings of BXML translate well to the LAN environment.  The uncompressed BXML encoding is still the most efficient, performing 2.8 times as fast with transfers of the VMAP0 data and 2.2 times as fast with the MSD3 data.


Utilizing an relational database system as the feature storage system imposes an unexpected high burden and is the major bottleneck in the LAN environment.  The overhead is so high that the effects of the different encodings tend to be largely muted, though BXML still technically performs the best.  CubeWerx will be investigating optimizations.  The use of a dual-processor server would like improve throughput significantly, since the Oracle activity during feature retrieval seems to be split between two processes which compete for CPU time.  (The server in the test environment has only one processor.)


Using an external codec with an efficient GML generator imposes substantial costs in this environment because of the fixed cost of the additional XML-GML parse/generate step(s).


14.3 Internet testing


In the Internet environment, compression is very important because of the limited bandwidth, 150 Kbytes/sec in the test case.  Since the compressed sizes of BXML and XML data are quite similar, their performance was also quote similar.  While BZIP2 gave the greatest amount of compression, GZIP provides the greatest throughput and GZIP is a ubiquitous format.


The sponsors of this project, including NGA, should insist that all of their software suppliers equip their GML-processing clients and servers with HTTP-based GZIP-compression support.  Using the HTTP mechanism allows support to be optional for both client and server while providing compression when both client and server support it.  GZIP is suitable for compressing streamed data on-the-fly.


Using an relational database system to server the features slowed down the transfer significantly, though not to the degree experienced in the LAN environment.  Using either BXML encoding or compression gives similar throughput since the server in this case cannot saturate the network link except in the XML case, where the network becomes the bottleneck instead of the database system.


Using an external codec with an efficient GML generator degrades performance, though not to the same degree as in the LAN case since the network is now the bottleneck and the client has more otherwise-idle CPU time with which to execute the external codec process.


14.4 Dial-up testing


In the dial-up network case, compression is crucial.  BZIP2-compressed XML generally gives the best performance in this environment since it generally gives the best compression.

Introduction 


This OpenGIS® Interoperability-Program report proposes and executes methods to 
evaluate the performance of the use of the Geography Markup Language (GML) as 
encoded in various ways. 


The Geography Markup Language [GML] is an increasingly important feature-encoding 
format for use in interoperable GIS systems.  Unfortunately, the innate text encoding that 
it uses is both bulky and slow to process.  To help GML realize its potential, its encoding 
efficiency should be made to be comparable with other commonly used feature-encoding 
formats, such as ESRI® Shapefile [SHAPE] format.  To this end, OGC has undertaken to 
test the compactness and system-throughput capacity of GML as encoded in numerous 
different ways, including binary encoding in BXML [BXML] and BinXML™ 
[BINXML] and general compression formats such as GZIP [GZIP] and BZIP2 [BZIP2].  
The decision of potential GML adopters becomes much easier when they can have both 
interoperability and efficiency.

6 Encoding formats 


It would informative to test the throughput and compactness of a number of feature-
encoding formats, including GML-XML, GML-BXML, ESRI® Shapefile, and 
MapInfo® MIF, both with and without GZIP and BZIP2 compression.  The GML version 
will be 3.1.1 with the Simple Features [GML-SF] profile.  With binary encoding, we 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 3
 


believe that the GML format can be much more competitive with binary formats such as 
Shapefile in terms of compactness and processing throughput.  MIF is an all-text format, 
which would be interesting to compare to GML-XML format. 


6.1 Binary-encoding formats 


BXML [BXML] is a straightforward patent-unencumbered binary-encoding format for 
XML data which is designed to be easy to implement and for which an open-source C-
language reference implementation is freely available [CWXML].  It is also an OGC 
Discussion Paper.  One of its most important features for our immediate purposes is that 
it allows lists of floating-point coordinate values to be directly represented as raw-binary 
arrays.  This provides both compactness and system throughput since converting 
coordinate values to and from a text representation is surprisingly time-consuming. 


BinXML™ is a commercial software product for which Galdos Systems is a reseller.  
Galdos can better explain the strengths of BinXML™. 


While a direct comparison of BXML and BinXML™ implemented in the same runtime 
environment would be desirable, CubeWerx does not have the resources or expertise to 
implement testing for BinXML™ in the scope of the OWS-3 project even if software 
licenses were provided.  However, an independent BinXML™ implementation in a 
different software architecture, such as a scripting-language/XML-tool environment 
relative to CubeWerx's RDBMS/C-language environment would still allow the direct 
comparison of encoding compactness and would provide an interesting performance 
characterization of the effectiveness of different encoding methods in the different GML-
processing environments as well as a concrete comparison of the architectural approaches 
overall. 


6.2 Data-compression formats 


GZIP [GZIP] and BZIP2 [BZIP2] formats do an excellent job of compressing XML data.  
In one rough example that was tested, GZIP achieved around an 80% compression rate 
(one-fifth the original size) and BZIP2 achieved around an 85% rate (one-sixth the 
original size) with GML data that had no unnecessary whitespace.  Specialized XML 
compression methods probably cannot out-compress GZIP and BZIP2 significantly in the 
general case. 


However, the encoding and decoding of GZIP and BZIP2 formats are very CPU-
intensive, so the “compaction” of the raw information before the “compression” step can 
have an large impact on overall system performance.  This trade-off is investigated.  
Binary encodings of XML are considerably more compact than XML itself. 


ZIP [ZIP] and compress [COMPRESS] compression formats are also in general use.  
ZIP format does not need to be considered in this investigation because it generally uses 
exactly the same compression method that GZIP does, called “Deflate”.  It is also not a 
streamable format which imposes complications in a streaming client/server environment.  
The compress method does not achieve as high a compression rate as GZIP (74% 







OGC 05-050 


4 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


compression for the example) and, as it turns out, does not execute as quickly as GZIP, so 
it does not need to be considered in this study.  Historically, compress executed more 
efficiently than GZIP, however, use and refinement of the method stagnated for many 
years because of patent issues. 


6.3 Complete format list 


The complete list of GML-encoding combinations that should be tested for both 
compactness and throughput is as follows: 


Base Format Encoding Compression 
GML XML none 
GML XML GZIP 
GML XML BZIP2 
GML BXML none 
GML BXML GZIP 
GML BXML BZIP2 
The GML encodings should be compared to other common feature-encoding formats, 
plus an extremely efficient one: 


Base Format Encoding Compression 
ESRI® Shapefile Binary + Text none 
ESRI® Shapefile Binary + Text GZIP 
ESRI® Shapefile Binary + Text BZIP2 
MapInfo® MIF Text none 
MapInfo® MIF Text GZIP 
MapInfo® MIF Text BZIP2 
CubeWerx® MDF Binary none 
CubeWerx® MDF Binary GZIP 
CubeWerx® MDF Binary BZIP2 
MDF is an high-performance format used by CubeWerx to load feature data into the 
Oracle database system.  It is a simple all-binary format in which geometries are stored in 
OGC Well-Known-Binary [WKB] format and the other properties are stored in fixed-
sized fields. 


One complication with the Shapefile, MIF, and MDF formats is that they are realized as a 
collection of multiple files instead of just one file.  The represented size will be the sum 
of the sizes of the constituent files that contain the equivalent information to GML 
format.  In a client/server environment, these files would need to be packaged together in 
an archive format such as ZIP or TAR [TAR], and the packaging requirement limits the 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 5
 


potential streamability of the formats since the complete first file in the package must be 
available before the first record of the subsequent file is streamed out from a server. 


For our testing purposes, it is sufficient to test the Shapefile and MIF formats only on a 
single machine to compare them with GML results on a single machine.  It would be a 
burden to incorporate these formats into the WFS interface, though it is technically 
feasible (when combined with a packaging format as mentioned above). 


One capability lacking from GML that Shapefile has is that of random access.  BXML 
and presumably BinXML™ incorporate mechanisms for random access to elements 
based on identifier attributes, but this is not a spatial index.  A spatial index would be 
needed to access features spatially as Shapefile and MDF allow, but none is provided by 
the GML format. 


7 Coordinate-value precision 


An easy way to achieve data compaction in both the XML and BXML representations of 
GML data is to reduce the precision of the coordinate values in the features.  Coordinate 
values are normally represented as double-precision floating-point values in GIS systems 
and this is equivalent to about 16 significant decimal digits.  However, no real-world data 
is this accurate and some applications do not even need the full precision of the real data.  
Sixteen decimal digits is equivalent to 4.4 nanometers (billionths of a meter) of resolution 
along the equator of the Earth. 


The GML encoding should be tested with both double-precision coordinate values as well 
as single-precision in order to quantify the increased compactness.  Single precision is 
equivalent to about seven significant decimal digits or 2.4 meters of resolution along the 
equator.  BXML encoding has the capability to dynamically select different encodings for 
XML-Schema [XML-SCHEMA] content identified as “list of double,” such as GML 
coordinates values. 


Intermediate precisions could also be tested.  This is easy to do with XML-encoded GML 
by selecting any integral number of significant decimal digits, though it is slightly more 
difficult to achieve with a binary encoding.  Floating-point doubles would best be used 
for this encoding with the least-significant bits of the mantissas zeroed out.  This data will 
have the same uncompressed size as with the full double precision, but it will compress 
better.  CubeWerx does not consider it to be worthwhile to investigate intermediate 
precisions at this time, though in the future, if systems have metadata about the absolute 
accuracy of the coorindate values in a feature collection, it could automatically select 
intermediate precisions individually for each feature type. 


There is an indirect benefit to always using full double precision values in all calculations 
in a distributed system in that most computers implement IEEE 754-1995 [FLOATS] 
floating-point format in hardware so that most systems will compute similar or identical 
results and will behave more deterministically when making threshold decisions (e.g., 







OGC 05-050 


6 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


“value >= 1e6”).  However, the increased compactness of using lesser precision in 
GML data may be a more important benefit. 


8 Network environments 


Testing should be conducted in the following environments: local file system (single 
machine), LAN (Local Area Network), Internet, and limited bandwidth (dial-up). 


8.1 Local filesystem 


It is very important to test GML-encoding performance on a single machine to determine 
directly and accurately the performance of the different GML encodings in isolation from 
confounding factors like network delays.  The most scientifically accurate methods 
should be applied in this experiment and measuring only in a distributed environment 
would be like measuring the dimensions of a book with a ruler that is marked only in 
integral feet.  Also, the encoding compactness will be the same as in local case as in the 
distributed case but will be easier to measure in the local case.  Testing on a local 
machine will also be necessary to compare against formats like Shapefile on their “home 
turf”. 


8.2 LAN and Internet environments with WFS 


GML is normally used to exchange geographic data in the LAN (Local-Area Network) 
within a single organization and over the Internet between organizations.  The purpose of 
testing in these network environments, considering that raw performance can be 
measured in a local-machine environment, is to demonstrate interoperability and to assess 
whether the raw performance differences are actually significant when combined with the 
network-transfer and WFS-processing costs of the normal GML usage environment. 


The LAN and Internet environments have different performance characteristics and 
represent the common cases for distributed GML-processing systems.  Compression 
almost always makes sense in an Internet environment since modern computers can apply 
GZIP compression to at least 70 Mbits/sec of text GML data, thereby saturating even 
high-speed Internet links.  However, modern LANs operate at at least 100 Mbits/sec, 
which imposes a different cost structure on encodings. 


8.3 WFS integration 


Two methods are available to integrate alternate GML encodings into the WFS interface: 
the WFS output-format mechanism and the HTTP transfer-encoding mechanism. 


The WFS interface provides a mechanism for selecting among different encodings for the 
feature data that it delivers.  The WFS 1.0.0 specification describes an optional attribute 
called “outputFormat” on the GetFeature request for which the default value is 
“GML2” in Section 9.2 on page 25.  The description on the same page also says: 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 7
 


The outputFormat attribute defines the format to use to generate the result 
set.  The default value is GML2 indicating that GML [2] shall be used.  
Vendor specific formats (including non-XML and binary formats), 
declared in the capabilities document are also possible.  The available 
types are identified using <ResultFormat> tag of the Capabilities 
document. 


In WFS version 1.1.0, the format identifiers are a little different.  The example in Section 
9.2 shows the string as “text/xml; subtype=3.1.1”.  To request BXML, the equivalent 
would be “application/x-bxml; subtype=3.1.1”.  The Capabilities schema is a little 
hard to follow, but it looks like the Capabilities tag is <OutputFormatList>. 


HTTP [HTTP], which the WFS interface is build on top of, also provides a built-in 
mechanism for requesting GZIP or compress encoding of the transferred content.  The 
client can include an “Accept-Encoding” MIME-header tag in the request message 
and the server has the option of responding with a “Content-Encoding” MIME-
header tag in the reply message that indicates that the body is compressed.  The HTTP 
RFC does not explicitly spell out support for BZIP2 encoding, but it can logically be 
included by using either “x-bzip2” or even “bzip2” as the encoding-tag value.  The 
nature of the mechanism makes the use of ad-hoc symbols non-intrusive.  BXML 
encoding could even be requested in this way. 


Since this content-encoding mechanism is built-in and optional, any WFS or WFS client 
has the option to support it and the data transfer will be optimized wherever possible.  All 
WFS clients and servers should support at least this mechanism.  Really, CubeWerx finds 
it rather mind-boggling that any production work would be attempted with GML in the 
Internet environment without at least using the HTTP mechanism for GZIP compression 
of the data stream. 


8.4 External codec 


An external codec is a piece of software that would be placed between a WFS client and 
server which would accept an XML-encoded GML stream from the WFS server, encode 
it into an alternate format, transport it to the client site, decode it back into XML-encoded 
GML and then pass it to the client application. 


A general external codec has at least two major problems: it is complicated to implement 
since it essentially would be a distributed, cascading WFS; it is inefficient since it 
requires the parsing and generation of the GML data not once but three times, including 
two times as XML-encoded GML, which would most likely render it less efficient than 
directly GZIP-compressing a plain XML-encoded GML stream using the HTTP 
mechanism. 


8.5 Limited-bandwidth network 


A limited bandwidth environment can serve as a guide for wireless and dial-up cases 
where limited facilities are available.  A suitable speed it 56 kbps.  The general 







OGC 05-050 


8 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


compression methods are expected to have the most significant impact in this 
environment, since the crucial performance factor will be minimizing the bandwidth 
usage. 


9 Scalability 


The scalability of GML data and processing systems should also be investigated.  This 
can be done easily using small, medium, and large data sets of the representative 
geometry types: points, lines, and polygons.  The testing definition of a ‘large’ data set is 
one with approximately 1-million features. 


A GML-processing system based on utilizing a DOM (Document Object Model) 
approach to XML processing will have its scalability inherently limited to the number of 
features that can be stored in machine memory at one time, so GML-processing systems 
should not be based strictly on the DOM methodology.  Systems based on XSLT [XSLT] 
tools will have the same scalability problems for the same reason. 


CubeWerx anticipates no inherent scalability problems with either the representation of 
or processing of a large number of GML features in its GML-processing systems.  The 
CWXML [CWXML] open-source library utilized by CubeWerx provides a node/subtree 
mechanism that supplies the convenience of a DOM mechanism with the scalability of  
the streamable SAX mechanism. 


Since the sponsor-supplied MSD3 data totals only in the thousands of features, VMAP0 
data is used to conduct scalability testing. 


10 Testing approach and environment 


10.1 Sample application 


The two kinds of “performance” to be measured in the GML Performance Investigations 
are system throughput (speed) and information-encoding compactness.  To test 
throughput, the various software levels of a representative GML-processing application 
are measured in a number of usage environments.  The compactness can be determined 
by measuring the size of the same GML feature data as encoded and compressed by the 
various different means. 


A representative GML-processing application is the fetching and rendering of a stream of 
GML data into a displayable image.  The application has the following software levels 
which can be characterized independently and in combination: 


● fetch features from underlying system 


● generate features in GML 


● transport features 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 9
 


● parse features into internal programming-language structures 


● render features into raster 


Feature rendering is not strictly necessary for measuring GML performance, but it 
provides concrete visible proof that all of the features of a data set were actually 
processed and it supplies an interesting comparison of the performance of two different 
architectures for SLD [SLD] styling that have been pursued by OGC participants: native 
implementation vs. XML tools.  Most GIS-product vendors including CubeWerx use the 
native-implementation approach.  Galdos uses an XML-tools approach.  Proponents have 
long advocated the benefits of each approach.  Also, the software to render features is 
already available in the testing environments anyway, and the timing of the rendering 
component can easily be computed and factored out of the GML-transfer components. 


10.2 Test data 


An MSD3 data set was supplied by the project sponsors which is defined relative to a 
large central XML Schema and some VMAP0 data was selected by the participants since 
it has more bulk for reliable testing and it has small schemas.  The VMAP0 data selected 
is described in clause 11 and the MSD3 data is described in clause 12. 


10.3 Testing methodology 


The general measuring methodology employed is to run each test case four times and 
discard the first run and average the subsequent three.  The first run may involve variable 
system-caching overheads that would be difficult to measure reliably.  In some cases, it is 
not feasible to perform four runs of every combination because it would take too long. 


All time measurements are for real elapsed “wall-clock” time.  This is the time of 
principal concern to most users.  (Other conceivable timing measurements include CPU-
processing time.) 


All figures for file sizes, transfer speeds, use SI unit-multiplier prefixes, which are 
normally base-10 [SI] but include a special notation for base-2 [SI-BIN].  For example, 
1 KB means exactly 1,000 bytes and 1 KiB means exactly 1,024 bytes. 


10.4 Testing environment 


The computer selected to be the server for the network test cases and the host for the 
local-file-system test case has the following specifications: 


● Processor: AMD® Athlon-64 3200+ (64-bit), 2.01 GHz, 512 KiB cache 


● Main memory: 1 GiB dual-channel DDR-400 MHz (PC-3200) 


● Hard drive: single 200-GB SATA 3-GB/s channel 


● HD sustained read speed: 63.73 MB/sec 







OGC 05-050 


10 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


● OS: Fedora Core 4 Linux for x86-64 (2.6.12 kernel) 


● Compiler: GCC 4.0.1 with -O3 optimization 


● File system: Linux ext3 journaling type 


Its name is “a64.cubewerx.com”. 


The computer selected to be the client for network testing is a laptop model with the 
following specifications: 


● Processor: Intel® Pentium-4 Mobile (32-bit), 2.00 GHz, 512 KiB cache 


● Main memory: 512 KiB 


● Hard drive: single 40-GB ATA U100 


● HD sustained read speed: 30.08 MB/sec 


● OS: Fedora Core 4 Linux for i686 (2.6.12 kernel) 


● Compiler: GCC 4.0.1 with -O3 optimization 


● File system: Linux ext3 journaling type 


10.5 Testing tools 


The following tools are be used in the testing: 


● cwcat – simple command-line file copier 


● cwdump – simple command-line feature-file displayer/copier 


● cwplot – simple command-line feature-file plotter with SLD support 


● xmlscan – simple command-line XML file copier/converter 


● CWXML – XML/BXML parser/generator library 


● CubeSERV® WFS – Oracle®-based Web Feature Service 


● gzip – open-source compression library 


● bzip2 – open-source compression library 


The cwcat program is modeled after the Unix® cat program but has special features 
including the capability to read from remote URLs (as do all of the “cw” programs) and 
to limit the throughput of the data it copies.  This latter feature is used to simulate Internet 
and dial-up networks as described in clause 10.7. 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 11
 


The cwdump program includes the capability to generate GML data in a CGI 
environment and this capability is used to implement the simulated high-performance 
WFS that is used for some test cases.  The implementation is described in clause 10.8. 


The xmlscan program is included with the open-source CWXML library and is handy 
for reformatting and ‘pretty printing’ XML/BXML data. 


Version 1.2.3 of the gzip compression library is used.  The maximum compression level 
of ‘9’ is used since the library can produce data at this compression level much faster 
than the LAN can absorb it, so it is better to maximize the amount of compression.  
Recent versions of this library include significant performance improvements over older 
versions.  The library-default compression level is ‘6’. 


Version 1.0.3 of the bzip2 compression library is used.  The bzip2 compression level of 
‘9’ is used, which is the maximum and the library default. 


10.6 Local-file-system testing 


Reading-speed testing was performed by using a script that translates the source data 
from the GML-XML distribution format into the format to be tested and then reads the 
data four times in a loop.  After the first read, the file content will be cached in memory, 
assuming that it fits, and subsequent reads show be as efficient as the format allows. 


Writing-speed testing was performed using the same approach as the reading testing, 
except that the time taken to read from the source-data format (uncompressed GML 
encoded in XML) is subtracted from the total read+write time, giving only the writing 
time. 


10.7 Network simulation 


Early Internet testing was attempted using the real Internet, but the results were far too 
variable minute-by-minute and day-by-day to produce results that were actually 
comparable to each other.  Instead, this testing is carried out using the CubeWerx internal 
100-Mbps LAN with the server CGI shell-script program augmented to pass the outgoing 
data through cwcat used as a precise flow-controlling filter.  This filter is so light-
weight that it does not influence the results and its operation closely simulates what 
happens with normal Internet transfers: the outgoing data from the generator program 
gets queued up in the outgoing socket buffers until the generator process is suspended 
while the data is slowly emptied onto the outgoing network connection. 


The data rate selected for Internet testing is 150 Kbytes/sec, which represents a decent 
Internet connection between any two points in North America or perhaps the world.  
Because of the structure of the interaction as a small request with a single large reply, it is 
not necessary to simulate packet latency (ping times) since TCP/IP is a sliding-window 
protocol that quite effectively hides packet latency for large transfers, but a 60-
millisecond latency is added on the server side anyway.

The data rate selected for Dial-up testing is 5.6 Kbytes/sec, which corresponds to 56 
Kbits/sec uncompressed.  A response latency of 200 milliseconds is inserted on the server 
side. 


The LAN used is a lightly loaded 100-Mbps Ethernet system with the server and laptop 
client directly connected to the network.  Pinging the server from the client takes an 
average of 0.141 milliseconds and the sustained HTTP data-transfer rate is 
11.70 MB/second. 


10.8 WFS simulation 


CubeWerx had insufficient time to fully integrate the needs of the MSD3 data into the 
CubeSERV transactional WFS, so a light-weight simulated WFS was implemented with 
this capability by building on the cwdump feature-displaying utility.  This utility is so 
efficient that it serves a second important purpose which is to determine what transfer 
costs are caused by the network as opposed to the relational-database system used by the 
full-feature WFS.  As it turns out, the RDBMS is quite costly. 


The simulated WFS has a simple CGI interface and it  reads features from BXML-
encoded GML files stored on the server and it recodes them on the fly according to the 
received request into XML or BXML encoding with GZIP, BZIP2, or no compression.  
In the case that uncompressed BXML is requested, the full re-coding process is still 
carried out for timing consistency.  The returned GML data references a schema which is 
also generated by the web application on request to be encoded in the same way as the 
GML data for the VMAP0 test data and which is copied directly from a pre-encoded 
schema file on the server for MSD3 data.  These methods correspond to the way these 
data sets would normally be used, since the MSD3 data is defined relative to a fixed 
central schema. 


For example, the following request for XML+GZIP: 


http://a64.cubewerx.com/ows3/simfs/simfs.cgi?REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=bu
iltupa&OUTPUTFORMAT=text/xml%3Bencoding%3Dgzip 


will reference its schema as: 


http://a64.cubewerx.com/ows3/simfs/simfs.cgi?REQUEST=DescribeFeatureType&TYPE
NAME=builtupa&OUTPUTFORMAT=text/xml%3Bencoding%3Dgzip 


The testing carried out is only to fetch and internally plot the requested data using the 
cwplot application, excluding the time taken to write out the resulting PNG image from 
the internal raster representation.  The features received at the client are not stored; each 
is discarded immediately after plotting. 


Thus, the execution time will include reading and re-coding the source data on the server, 
transferring it over the network, parsing the data into internal C-language feature 
representations, and plotting it into a C-language raster representation.  The translation 
from GML to internal the C-language structures provides a means of validating the data 







OGC 05-050

in terms of properties and data types, though this is a different from from XML-Schema-
based validation. 


The plotting speed turns out to be so fast that plotting adds virtually no overhead to the 
process, so it is safe to include here.  Also, the data is fully streamed, so if the client can 
process the data more quickly than the network can deliver it, the client operations will 
effectively have no cost.  The same is true of the server if it can supply the data faster 
than the network can absorb it. 


11 VMAP0-data testing 


The following feature collections from the VMAP0 data are used for testing, in order of 
the number of features per collection: 


Collection Description Geom Type Properties Features Vertices 
builtupa Built-up Areas Polygon 6 8,346 17.3
inwatera Inland Water Bodies Polygon 6 153,358 19.2
elevp Elevation Points Point 8 175,880 1.0
watrcrsl Water Courses LineString 6 290,528 8.9
coutourl Contour Lines LineString 7 1,099,837 30.7
The terms “feature type” and “feature collection” can be used interchangeably here, since 
each feature collection includes features of exactly one type.  The “Properties” column 
gives the number of properties in the features; the “Features” column gives the number of 
features in each feature collection; and the “Vertices” column gives the average number 
of vertices in the geometry of each feature, which indicates how complex the geometries 
are.  (The start/end point of a polygon ring is counted as two vertices.)  This data set 
includes feature-collection sizes of medium volume to large volume.  The contourl 
feature collection is suitable for demonstrating the scalability of the processing 
applications. 


The source VMAP0 geometries have single-precision coordinate values, so versions of 
the elevp and watrcrsl feature collections were created that have double-precision 
coordinate values for comparison purposes.  Use of the double-precision versions is 
specifically noted.

11.1.1.1 Reading 


The reading results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)







OGC 05-050

Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 6.17 0.533 15,659
GML XML indented 7.41 0.547 15,258
GML BXML none 2.44 0.151 55,272
GML XML gzip 1.15 0.592 14,098
GML XML indented + gzip 1.16 0.609 13,704
GML BXML gzip 1.07 0.183 45,607
GML XML bzip2 1.016 0.882 9,463
GML BXML bzip2 1.053 0.404 20,658
The compression type indicated as “indented” is not compression at all but means that the 
text file was “pretty printed” with an indentation of two spaces for each XML-tag level.  
As expected, it makes the uncompressed version of the file significantly large; however, 
it does not add significantly to the gzip-compressed size or time.  This extra whitespace 
compresses very well. 


In general, the GZIP compression/decompression method operates faster than expected.  
It will likely be made faster still in the future when certain hashing-table patents expire. 


We fixed a performance bug in the BXML parser during the course of this testing that 
caused it to unnecessarily convert numeric property values to text before re-converting 
them back to numbers for the reading application.  This resulted in a 40% performance 
increase. 


The GML reader is not that heavily optimized.  It uses the node/subtree interface of the 
CWXML library, which reads in DOM-like subtrees for each feature but only holds one 
feature in memory at a time.  In contrast, the GML writer uses a node-by-node approach 
and its performance of 117,549 given below shows how much faster that approach can 
be.  The node-subtree approach is easier to program for reading, however, and some 
modest optimization attempts showed that reading features is harder to optimize than 
writing them. 


11.1.1.2 Reading alternate formats 


The reading results for the builtupa feature collection represented in alternative 
formats to GML are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
Shapefile (binary+text) none 3.70 0.047 178,143
MIF (text) none 3.25 0.249 33,558
MDF (binary) none 3.62 0.031 267,819
The relevant comparison here is to GML encoded in BXML at 55.3 kF/s and XML at 
15.7 kF/s.  The MIF text format can be processed twice as fast as XML-encoded GML 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 15
 


and Shapefile can be processed 3.2 times as fast as BXML-encoded GML.  This is a little 
surprising and disappointing, given that Shapefile numeric properties are actually stored 
in a text representation.  CubeWerx MDF format performs 4.9 times as fast as BXML-
encoded GML.  It should also be noted that both Shapefile and MDF formats always 
store coordinate values as double-precision floats, but they still out-perform BXML-
encoded GML. 


The processing performance of these alternate formats when compressed was not tested, 
but the compressed sizes were measured as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) 
Shapefile (binary+text) gzip 1.45
Shapefile (binary+text) bzip2 1.25
MIF (text) gzip 1.02
MIF (text) bzip2 0.94
MDF (binary) gzip 1.49
MDF (binary) bzip2 1.17
The compressed sizes are comparable to but not quite as good as the GML compressed 
sizes, except for MIF format, which is more compact in all cases. 


11.1.1.3 Writing 


The writing results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 6.17 0.693 12,043
GML XML indented 7.41 0.723 11,544
GML BXML none 2.44 0.071 117,549
GML XML gzip 1.15 1.698 4,915
GML XML indented + gzip 1.16 1.685 4,953
GML BXML gzip 1.07 0.436 19,142
GML XML bzip2 1.016 3.000 2,782
GML BXML bzip2 1.053 0.791 10,551
The reported timings for the writing speed are reduced by the 0.533 seconds taken to read 
the source builtupa data.  There is quite a spike in the performance of the 
uncompressed BXML case, since this format is very efficient to write. 


11.1.1.4 Plotting 


The plotting results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows: 







OGC 05-050

Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 6.17 0.582 14,340
GML BXML none 2.44 0.231 36,130
GML XML gzip 1.15 0.641 13,020
GML BXML gzip 1.07 0.262 31,855
The plotting window is between longitudes -180 and 0 and latitudes -40 to 90 and is size 
3600 pixels horizontal by 2600 vertical and the output image type is PNG.  The writing 
time of the PNG file is excluded from the time.  The SLD styling symbol uses a light-
pink fill (#EEA9B8) with a dark-pink outline (#FFC0CB).  A scaled down version (to 
reduce document size) of the resulting image is included here: 


 


The data is rather sparse, but this test demonstrates that the full North American coverage 
has been processed in our testing. 


If we eliminate the GML-data-reading time, the internal plotting time is only around 
0.080 seconds for a speed of around 104,000 features per second.  While this 
performance is not strictly what is to be measured in this experiment, it would be very 
interesting to see how well a GML-XSLT-SVG plotting system performs.  We suspect 
not as well.  A system needs to be fast at plotting features in order to offer an effective 
WMS interface.

The GML-XML-uncompressed case likely includes file-cache-miss effects, since the file 
size is just short of the amount of physical memory on the machine, but the effect is most 
likely not significant, since the performance is consistent with the GML-XML-gzip case.

The reported timings for the writing speeds are reduced by the 77.809 seconds taken to 
read the source contourl data. 


These results most likely include file-cache-miss effects.  However, this effect appears to 
be limited, since if the testing tool is limited to processing only the first 200,000 features

faster.

The plotting window covers the whole world and the image is 3600 pixels across by 1800 
(with a scaled-down version included here).  The SLD plotting style uses brown strokes

The raw internal plotting speed is around 254,000 features per second. 


11.1.8 Conclusions 


Uncompressed BXML provided the fastest reading, writing, and plotting performances 
for local file-system testing.  This is the expected result.  Averaging the single-precision 
test cases, BXML format files were only 40% as large as the uncompressed-XML files; 
they were read 4.0 times as fast for an average of 71,606 features/second; and they were 
written 8.2 times as fast for an average of 117,760 features/second. 


Using compression in the local file system just slows down the performance.  This would 
only be recommended to conserve space.  The compressed file sizes between BXML and 
XML are quite similar, but the compressed BXML files could be read and written much 
faster than the compressed XML files. 


Using double precision coordinate values produces files that are significantly larger and 
take significantly more time to process.  This is as expected. 


The BXML encoding of GML falls far short of the reading performance of Shapefile and 
CubeWerx MDF formats.  Shapefile, the golden standard, can be read an average of 3.0

times as fast as the BXML-encoded GML format. 


The plotting performance of the CubeWerx SLD renderer is astonishingly high. 


11.2 LAN testing with high-performance simulated WFS 


11.2.1 Built-up areas 


The plotting results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 6.17 1.590 5,249

GML XML bzip2 1.016 3.763 2,218
GML BXML bzip2 1.090 2.127 3,924
There are competing factors in the determination of the performance in this environment: 
the encoding, the compressing and decompressing, and the network bandwidth.  The 
network in this case is fairly high in bandwidth and compression is fairly expensive.  The 
client-side CPU utilization showed up as being between 8% and 43%, with the former for 
uncompressed data and the latter for bzip2-compressed data.

GML BXML bzip2 2.44 16.966 10,367
It is interesting that the XML+gzip case is faster than the XML-uncompressed case, as 
opposed to most other feature types where the uncompressed data is faster.  In this case, 
the GML file contains a much greater amount of redundancy than the other feature types 
since the quasi-random coordinate data occupies a much smaller portion of the file and 
the XML tags a much greater portion.  The file ends up being compressed to such a 
degree that the faster transfer speed improves the overall performance.  Or, it could be 
that the GZIP compressor is disproportionately slow at compressing quasi-random 
numbers.

11.2.8 Conclusions 


Uncompressed BXML still gives the best performance in the LAN environment with the 
simulated WFS, performing an average of 2.8 times as fast as XML encoding over the 
seven test cases. 


Gzip compression is much more competitive in this environment and was actually faster 
than uncompressed data in a couple of instances.  Bzip2 compression is still too CPU-
bound to be competitive in this environment. 


11.3 LAN testing with relational-database WFS 


LAN testing with a relational-database WFS is carried out using the CubeSERV WFS 
accessing feature from Oracle relational tables.

These results are somewhat disappointing and show that accessing a relational database 
incurs a substantial time overhead.  The close similarity of all the timings regardless of 
encoding format show that accessing this data from the database has a fixed cost of 
around 25 seconds relative to a few seconds of difference for processing the different 
encodings, rendering the encoding unimportant in this environment.

The performance here is better than for other geometry types because points are simpler 
geometry types and they are stored in a simpler way in the database accessed by the 
WFS.

11.3.8 Conclusions 


The GML encoding did not have a great effect in this testing.  Retrieving the feature data 
from Oracle was the major bottleneck in this environment. 


11.4 Internet testing with simulated high-performance WFS

There are competing factors in the determination of the performance in this environment: 
the encoding, the compressing and decompressing, and the network bandwidth.  The 
network in this case is fairly low in bandwidth and compression is relatively inexpensive, 
so file size is the major determinate of performance. 


One would need to be crazy not to compress GML data being sent over the Internet.

The XML+bzip2 case may seem anomalously slow, but this is what was reliably 
measured.  The major factor would be the bulkiness of the data input to the expensive 
bzip2-compression algorithm.

The simulated high-performance network is efficient enough to saturate the network in all 
cases except for using bzip2 compression, but it comes close even then. 


11.4.8 Conclusions 


Compression is the most important factor in this test environment.  Since the compressed 
sizes of BXML and XML are quite similar, the performance was also quite similar.  
Using bzip2 compression frequently gave the best performance, though bzip2 applied to 
XML was substantially slower than the other encodings since BXML is slow to execute 
and XML gives the compression method a bulky input stream.

11.5 Internet testing with relational-database WFS 


11.5.1 Built-up areas 


The plotting results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)

GML XML bzip2 1.03 31.207 267
GML BXML bzip2 1.13 31.749 263
The network was the bottleneck in the uncompressed-XML test case but retrieving the 
features from the database was the bottleneck in the rest of the cases.  The throughput 
was about 145 kbytes/sec in the uncompressed-XML case but only 93 kbytes/sec in the 
uncompressed-BXML test case (significantly less than the network bandwidth).  
Applying compression increases the elapsed time since retrieving features from the 
database is already a CPU-intensive activity, and compression adds to the CPU-power 
bottleneck.  The XML+bzip2 test case achieves a network utilization of only 33 
kbytes/sec.  The other feature types below follow a similar pattern.

11.5.8 Conclusions 


Using a relational database shows less overhead in the Internet environment, though full 
network utilization is not achieved for the non-uncompressed-XML test cases.  The other 
encodings are compact enough that the CPU and database access on the server is the 
bottleneck. 


11.6 Dial-up testing 


This testing was carried out using the same simulated method as with the Internet testing.  
In this case, the link speed was set to 5,600 bytes/second to correspond to a 56-
kbit/second low-speed link.  No built-in compression was simulated over the link. 


11.6.1 Measured results 


The plotting results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 6.172 1,102.382 7.57

GML XML bzip2 1.015 182.290 45.78
GML BXML bzip2 1.089 195.392 42.71
Transferring any volume of data over the link is obviously very slow and is completely 
dominated by the link speed.  The CPU utilization on the client was shown as 0% to 2%. 


Very limited plotting performance was measured for the inwatera feature collection:

This test case ran for approximately six hours. 


11.6.2 Extrapolated results 


The testing for the dial-up case is extremely time-consuming and the results have been 
demonstrated to be determined by the link speed, so presented here is an extrapolation of 
the testing of all seven feature collections being concatenated together (2,194,357 
features): 


Format Encoding Compression Size (MB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 1,606.46 286,868 7.65
GML BXML none 666.56 119,029 18.44
GML XML gzip 318.22 56,825 38.62
GML BXML gzip 304.22 54,325 40.39
GML XML bzip2 276.71 49,413 44.41
GML BXML bzip2 280.92 50,164 43.74
If all these test cases were executed once in practice, it would take over seven days. 


11.6.3 Conclusions 


Dial-up links are very slow, so the GML encoding with the greatest compression will 
have the highest throughput.  In this case, bzip2 gives the best compression and therefore, 
the best throughput.  The bzip2 file sizes are slightly smaller for XML than BXML, so 
XML+bzip2 gives the best throughput. 


12 MSD3-data testing 


It would not be feasible or greatly useful to perform manual testing on all of the 
individual feature types, so four instances were chosen for manual testing to represent the 
MSD3 data set: three feature collections of varying geometry type plus an aggregation of 
all the feature types.  The aggregation was obtained simply by concatenating together all 
of the <gml:featureMember> elements of the supplied GML feature collections.  
The schema references were also changed to be locally available and offered up with the 
different encodings of the test instances (e.g., XML, BXML, compressed).  The source 
data is all three-dimensional, but two-dimensional versions are also tested. 


The following feature collections from the MSD3 data are used for testing: 


Collection Description Geom Type Properties Features Vertices 
MSD3 MSD3 Aggregate various 33.0 7,448 8.5

AAL015 Building Areas MultiSurface 45 857 7.2
LAP030 Roads MultiCurve 20 1,444 5.5
PAL015 Building Points MultiPoint 45 2,888 1.0
The “Properties” column gives the average number of properties per feature present in 
the MSD3 collection, excluding the topology property (since it is not processed).  The 
“Vertices” column is the average number of vertices per geometry for all feature 
collections. 


Two versions of the MSD3 schema were available for testing: the full version and a 
version with all of the <appinfo> metadata trimmed out of it.  The major reporting of 
results is for the trimmed version of the schema with additional comments about the 
performance with the full schema. 


The testing of 3D coordinate values versus 2D coordinate values is reported only for the 
MSD3-aggregation feature collection.  The performance difference between 2D and 3D is 
not that large and the aggregation case shows the difference sufficiently. 


12.1 Local file-system testing 


The GML and schema files were tested using local files. 


12.1.1 MSD3 aggregation, 3D 


The MSD3 aggregate feature collection has the following appearance when plotted with 


translucent fills and no feature-type-specific styling: 


The reading results for the MSD3 feature collection using the trimmed MSD3 schema are 
as follows:

Format Encoding Compression Size (KB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 13,511 1.621 4,594

GML XML bzip2 499 2.485 2,997
GML BXML bzip2 819 1.416 5,261
Parsing the schema takes a significant amount of the elapsed time.  The schema is 
supplied with in the same encoding and compression format as the GML data.  The 
parsing time for the trimmed and full MSD3 schemas are as follows, with schema sizes in 
KB and parsing times in seconds: 


Format Encoding Compress Trim Size Trim Time Full Size Full Time 
Schema XML none 1,337 0.318 8,056 0.815
Schema BXML none 581 0.238 3,696 0.433
Schema XML gzip 28 0.329 446 0.873

Schema XML bzip2 14 0.411 204 1.442
Schema BXML bzip2 12 0.273 190 0.715
The writing results for the MSD3 feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (KB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 13,511 1.030 7,231
GML BXML none 7,172 0.335 22,226
GML XML gzip 626 1.943 3,833
GML BXML gzip 929 1.030 7,234
GML XML bzip2 499 11.656 639
GML BXML bzip2 819 6.458 1,153
The source-data reading time of 1.621 seconds is subtracted from the write timings 
above.  Note that no new schema file is written out here since the generated GML data 
refers to a preexisting schema file. 


The XML encodings of the compressed data are significantly smaller than the BXML 
versions.  This is likely because BXML format compacts the data with the primary goal 
being for speed of processing whereas GZIP and BZIP2 formats compact data with the 
primary goal being minimization of size.

12.1.2 MSD3 aggregation, 2D 


The reading results for the MSD3_2D feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (KB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)
GML XML none 13,241 1.577 4,735

GML XML bzip2 447 2.413 3,087
GML BXML bzip2 725 1.356 5,494
There does not appear to be a great performance advantage in using 2D coordinates over 
3D ones.  This is presumably because the extra coordinate dimension takes a relatively 
small amount of space compared to all of the attributes.  The difference would be larger if 
the geometries in the MSD3 data included significantly more vertices. 


The writing results for the MSD3_2D feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (KB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)

The writing time excludes the 1.577 seconds required to read the source data to be 
written.

The AAL015 feature collection (Building Areas) has the following appearance:

GML XML bzip2 48.1 0.781 1,097
GML BXML bzip2 82.1 0.502 1,707
As discussed with the MSD3-aggregate case, parsing the schema takes a substantial 
amount of the elapsed time.  However, since this feature collection is much smaller and 
the schema-parsing time is fixed for each different encoding, schema parsing now takes 
the majority of the elapsed time. 


The writing results for the AAL015 feature collection are as follows: 


Format Encoding Compression Size (KB) Time (s) Speed (F/s)

12.1.6 Conclusions 


Uncompressed BXML encoding gives the best performance in the local-file-system test 
case.  Since the MSD3 3D case actually includes the data for the other test cases, it is the 
most representative one.  The BXML format was 1.85 times as fast as XML and was only 
53% as large for using the trimmed schema. 







OGC 05-050 


44 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


A large performance factor with this data is the schema, since it is so large relative to the 
data.  Two versions were tested, a trimmed version and the full version which includes a 
great deal of metadata.  Both versions include definitions for hundreds of feature types 
that are not present in the test data set. 


The BXML version of the trimmed schema is 43% as large as the XML version and can 
be processed 1.34 times as fast.  The BXML version of the full schema is 46% as large as 
the XML version and can be processed 1.88 times as fast.  Parsing the trimmed schema 
takes 27% of the BXML execution time. 


Compression gives poor performance in this environment because the compression 
algorithms are slow to execute.  However, if storage size is the crucial restriction, then 
XML+bzip2 gives the best compression, though it is much slower to execute than gzip 
compression. 


The BXML compressed files are substantially larger than the XML compressed file.  The 
reason for this is not known. 


Processing 2D data versus 3D data did not make a substantial difference in either the 
processing time or the file size.  This is likely because the features have relatively few 
vertices per geometry and have a large number of properties, so the extra coordinate in 
the 3D data does not take a substantial amount of extra space. 


12.2 LAN testing 


The BXML format includes a central symbol table and a mechanism to make any text 
content reference a string in this table.  The advantage is that a literal string value need 
appear in the BXML file only once and it can be referenced by a compact index value 
thereafter.  The option is enabled in the BXML generator for the MSD3 network cases to 
make all generated content strings use this central symbol table for greater compactness.   


The reason this option was not enabled in the file-system testing is that there appears to 
be a performance bug in the CWXML library that makes processing referenced strings a 
little slower than literal strings.  However, in the network environment, the increased 
compactness of the volume of data sent over the network provides better performance 
than using the literal strings.

12.2.6 External codec 


An external codec (encoder-decoder, external to the main GML-consuming program) was 
added to the LAN testing script by adding a Unix shell statement of the form: 


  xmlscan -url data_url -pack | cwplot -f - parameters 


This executes the xmlscan program which reads the GML data from the server as a 
separate process from the cwplot program which plots the data.  The xmlscan 
program reads the data in whatever format is requested from the server but always 
delivers it to the cwplot program as uncompressed XML, so this arrangement operates 
as an “external codec” for delivering GML data to a client application that does not 
understand BXML or the compression formats.  A caveat is that it would be very 
awkward to intercept the retrieval of the schemas, so only the GML data is subjected to 
the external codec, not the schema access.  Also, this external codec is implemented only 







OGC 05-050 


Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 47
 


on the client side; the external codec could be extended onto the server side as discussed 
in clause 8.4 which would impose greater costs and complications for recognizing and 
translating coordinate values and other numbers. 


This arrangement is functionality equivalent to the direct MSD3 test, except the external 
codec will create more execution overhead on the client from managing multiple 
processes and in interprocess pipe and from executing an extra decoding and encoding 
step.  Additionally, the extra encoding step will be for regular XML and the decoding 
step inside of the cwplot program will always be for regular XML-encoded GML. 


The plotting results for the MSD3 3D feature collection using the external codec are as 
follows (sizes in KB, times in seconds, speeds in features/second): 


Format Encoding Compress Size Time Speed Lost Time Lost Speed
GML XML none 13,512 6.777 1,099 1.922 435
GML BXML none 3,753 5.928 1,257 3.727 2,128
GML XML gzip 627 6.091 1,223 1.999 594
GML BXML gzip 910 5.708 1,305 3.445 1,986
GML XML bzip2 499 13.316 559 0.261 12
GML BXML bzip2 776 8.071 923 3.680 773
The results show that the use of an external codec imposes significant throughput costs in 
the Internet environment and the benefits of using BXML in this environment are largely 
nullified.  The lost performance would be significantly larger if the schema fetching was 
also run through an external codec. 


Note that the XML-none figure does not really belong here since the main application in 
this arrangement can consume regular XML directly, so an external codec is not really 
needed in this case. 


12.2.7 Conclusions 


The uncompressed BXML encoding gives the best performance in the LAN test case, 
same as with the VMAP0 data.  The BXML format was 2.2 times as fast as XML and 
was only 28% as large for using the trimmed schema.  Using the symbol-table BXML 
mechanism makes the BXML files substantially smaller here than in the file-system 
testing where it was turned off. 


Schema processing is a large factor with the MSD3 data.  The BXML verison of the 
trimmed schema is 26% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.59 times as 
fast.  The BXML version of the full schema is 28% as large as the XML version and can 
be processed 2.5 times as fast.  Parsing the trimmed schema takes 20% of the BXML 
execution time.  The schemas compress extremely well. 







OGC 05-050

Compression performs better in this environment than in the file-system environment 
because there is a trade-off between processing time taken to compress the data and the 
effectively increased network throughput of the compressed data.  However, the LAN is 
fast enough that the processing time is more costly.  The BXML compressed data files 
are substantially larger than the XML compressed file.  The reason for this is not known. 


Using an external codec adds a substantial overhead in this environment and tends to 
even out the timings because of the large fixed overhead of the fixed XML-GML 
generate/parse steps.

The results here are quite different from the LAN test case.  The primary difference is 
that in this case, the client CPU is largely idle in the direct-connection case, so the 
resources are readily available to execute the external codec and while keeping up with 
the server.  There is no obvious explanation for why the uncompressed cases actually 
experience performance improvements, though there may be some subtle effects in the 
network-simulation implementation. 


The cases where the performance is significantly worse is probably related to the fixed 
overhead of executing the decode-generate-decode steps on the client.  The break-even 
point seems to be around the 14-second period of the XML-bzip2 case, though in this 
case, the server would be very busy executing the expensive bzip2-compression 
algorithm.  Indeed, in this case, the server can only generate 37 kbytes/sec over the 
simulated 150-kbyte/sec link.  The server is nearly able to saturate the link in the gzip test 
cases, and so would deliver the maximum concentration of features per second.  In the 
uncompressed cases, the network is the bottleneck, so the number of features per second 
that the client needs to process is restricted. 


12.3.7 Conclusions 


Compression is crucial to performance in the Internet environment because of the limited 
network bandwidth.  However, while bzip2 compression gives the greatest compactness, 
gzip gives the better throughput. 


The XML+gzip case gives the best throughput in this environment.  The portion time 
taken parsing the schema is substantially lower in this environment than in the LAN 
environment because the schemas compress incredibly well.

Using an external codec adds greatly less overhead than in the LAN environment because 
the client machine has much more idle time while waiting for data to come from the 
network that it can spend on the fixed cost of the fixed XML-GML generate/parse steps.

12.4.6 Conclusions 


With a dial-up link, compression is crucial to performance.  Whatever encoding method 
produces the fewest bytes to represent a feature collection will be the fastest, pretty much 
regardless of how much processing the encoding method takes.  In the case of the MSD3 
data, the best encoding method for dial-up links is XML+bzip2. 


13 GML issues 


In the course of carrying out this performance study, some problem areas with using 
GML were identified. 


13.1 The trouble with application schemas 


There are two general approaches to handling the schemas associated with GML data.  
One way is to auto-generate a custom-tailored schema for each GML file that is 
generated from the information available from the source feature format, as was done for 
the VMAP0 test data set, and the other way is to use an external, centralized schema, as 
was done for the MSD3 test data set. 


Using a custom-tailored schema is the approach taken with most other feature formats, 
with the schema information normally embedded within the data file(s).  A vulnerability 
with this approach is the fidelity with which the schema information is carried from one 
representation to another.  Sometimes, the sizes of properties or letter case of names are 
changed, and most feature formats have tricky idiosyncrasies.  For example, in Shapefile 
format, numeric types are actually stored as strings, and a numeric type with width=9 and 
scale=3 can actually store any number that can be represented in nine characters.  Some 
tools even write numbers in scientific notation. 


Using the centralized-schema approach has problems also.  One major problem is that the 
centralized schema may include a great number of feature-type definitions and a great 
deal of metadata that is not relevant to the purpose at hand.  For example, the MSD3 
central schema includes definitions for 443 different feature types even though the 
sponsor-supplied data includes only 93 feature types and 83% of the bulk of the full 
schema contains metadata which is not relevant to the performance-testing activities of 
the OWS-3 project.  The schema is so large that parsing it takes a significant portion of 
the time to read the MSD3 data and it even takes the majority of the time for smaller 
feature collections. 


The other major problem with centralized application schemas is that it is easy to include 
arbitrary formatting declarations that general-purpose GML client and server applications 
cannot understand or follow.  This problem is present with custom-generated schemas 
also, though the arbitrariness is limited in practice to the types of declarations that are 
portable between common representation formats.  For instance, if the data is held in a 
relational-database format using simple types (plus a geometry), then the generated 
schema will reflect this simplicity. 







OGC 05-050 


54 Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 


Handling arbitrary schema declarations may be an unsolvable computing problem in the 
general case and is at least a complex artificial-intelligence problem since in order for a 
computer to transform data from one representation into an arbitrary new one, it needs to 
“understand” the semantics of the information, and arbitrary semantics probably are not 
representable in a declarative way. 


Schema-processing in the centralized-schema approach is particularly onerous because 
the schema theoretically needs to be parsed and understood in order to even write the 
GML data correctly, whereas with the custom-generated schema approach the GML 
writer is easily and statically preprogrammed to generate its output GML in accordance 
with the schema that it generates.  In practice, however, vendors will not implement a 
capability to “understand” the schema of the GML data they are writing; they will instead 
simply implement application-specific hacks into their GML generators to handle any 
arbitrariness in the application schemas. 


It is also possible to implement any arbitrary transformations needed for generated data 
using a hand-made application-specific transformation script as a post-processing step 
and to do the reverse in the same way on the client side.  However, beyond the manual 
effort involved in creating and managing the transformation programs to service all of the 
different feature types in a data set, portable transformation programs are generally 
written in XSLT, which, given the way that XSLT operates, is likely to be inefficient and 
may not work at all for large feature sets like the Contour Lines of the VMAP0 test data 
since XSTL implementations tend to store the entire XML stream in memory, which also 
imposes streamability limitations.  It is theoretically possible to optimize XSLT to behave 
in a streamable fashion where the transformation to be carried out permits, but this 
optimization is not yet available in real-world XSLT implementations, but even if it is 
available, the XML stream still needs to be parsed and generated an additional time. 


However, there is a fairly easy way around the problems of dealing with arbitrary XML 
schemas, which is to use simplified canonical profiles of GML and XML-Schema, such 
as the GML Simple-Features Profile [GML-SF].  If both the application schema and the 
GML generator conform to the profile (or specific compliance level of future versions of 
the profile), and if the source format for the generator retains the typing information of 
the schema with the full fidelity of the schema profile, then the generated GML will 
always conform to the central application schema. 


13.2 GML MeasureType 


A practical problem with gml:MeasureType is that the attributes take a fairly large 
amount of space in the GML data files, whereas the measurement unit for individual 
properties all appear to be constant in the MSD3 data.  It would be much more space-
efficient if the if the fixed unit associated with each measurement property in the MSD3 
data could be specified once in the schema definition or metadata rather than being 
repeated in-line with every property instance. 


The presence of the attribute on every property instance also imposes the need on 
consumers to re-map and retain this information for every measurement property instance 







OGC 05-050

when the data is transformed into another feature format in order to maintain the fidelity 
of the data, since the consumer will not know in advance (or really, ever) that the unit is 
actually fixed.  This information may be awkward to re-map and will be time- and space-
consuming in other feature representations.  This author is not aware of any other format 
that includes a variable-unit mechanism. 


13.3 GML streamability 


A format is “streamable” if it can be generated, transfered, and consumed without any 
undue storage between the end points.  Streamability is desirable because it minimizes 
processing delays and storage costs throughout the system.  However, there are a few 
features of GML that interfere with its streamability. 


13.3.1 Mid-stream errors 


A GML feature collection can include features from numerous different feature types and 
the WFS interface allows requests to be made for multiple feature types and this can 
cause streamability issues on the server side since many systems implement the storage 
of features of different types using a separate internal feature collection for each different 
type.  Also, all OWS requests require the response to be either a valid document of the 
requested format or to be a specially coded exception report. 


The way that a query that includes multiple feature types is normally implemented is to 
process the feature-type queries in order and generate the GML output.  But this poses a 
big problem if any errors are encountered in the intermediate steps, since if any errors are 
encountered at any point during the GML-generation process, an exception report must 
be generated instead of a GML document.  GML includes no mechanism for reporting an 
error after the generation of the stream has begun. 


In order for a generating application to be (mostly) safe is to generate all of the output 
data to a temporary file and then copy this file to the network, but then the generation 
time is wasted.  This problem is compounded in the Internet environment because the 
network is usually the bottleneck and it will be idle while the temporary file is generated.   


Really, the only sane approach for WFS implementers is to cheat in some way. 


13.3.2 Bounding envelope 


The requirement that the bounding envelope be stated at the beginning of a feature stream 
is desirable for clients, but it imposes restrictions on streamability for servers.  The only 
way to be sure that the tightest envelope is stated in the general case is to pre-scan all of 
the features according to all of the query constraints. 


13.3.3 Feature interleaving 


Another streamability issue is that features in a GML feature collection may appear in 
any order and be mixed together.  This poses no problems for GML generators since they 
can choose any order which is convenience, but it does pose problems for GML 







OGC 05-050

consumers since many client applications cannot process a sequence of more than one 
feature type at a time.  If only one feature type is in a stream, a clever client with the one-
feature-type-at-a-time constraint can process it in one pass, but this is not possible if more 
than one feature type is present in the stream.  The client would need to either store or re-
retrieve the stream when it is ready to process the next feature type. 


GML should include some mechanism to indicate whether or not the features of a type 
are contiguous and/or appear in the order of the feature types in the schema.  This would 
allow simple applications to process a GML stream one feature-type at a time in one pass. 


14 Conclusions 


14.1 Local file-system testing 


Testing in the local file system showed that binary encoding using BXML was around 
four times as fast for reading and eight times as fast for writing GML data compared to 
XML for the VMAP0 test data.  The performance figures for the MSD3 data showed a 
lower overall improvement because the parsing of the bulky application schema is 
conflated with the data encode/decode speeds.  When factored out, the BXML reading is 
about twice as fast and the writing is about three times as fast.  The MSD3 data has many 
more properties than the VMAP0 data. 


We also need to be cognizant in general that the CWXML parser is extremely well 
optimized for scanning XML and BXML realized in other environments may be even 
more efficient than comparable XML parsers since the BXML format is quite easy to 
process efficiently. 


The BXML files are around 40% the size of the XML files and can be smaller still if 
space-saving options are enabled, and there are design tweaks that can be applied to 
future versions of BXML to increase compactness.  When compression is applied, the 
BXML files are frequently around the same size as the XML files, though sometimes the 
BXML files can be significantly larger, as with the MSD3 data files.  The XML encoding 
of MSD3 has the advantage that the source data is rounded to ten significant decimal 
digits, but these are not round values when represented in binary, which reduces the 
compressibility of the BXML representation.  The compressed BXML files are still 
substantially faster to process than the compressed XML files, especially with the 
relatively efficient GZIP method. 


Using double-precision coordinate values with the VMAP0 data produced files that were 
significantly larger and slower to process than using single-precision coordinates.  
However, using 2D coordinate values instead of 3D coordinate values with the MSD3 
data did not make a significant difference in size or processing speed, likely because the 
coordinate values occupy a relatively small portion of the overall MSD3-data size. 







OGC 05-050

The BXML encoding of GML falls far short of the performance available with other 
feature-file formats.  Shapefile can be read about three times faster than BXML-encoded 
GML. 


14.2 LAN testing 


The speed and size savings of BXML translate well to the LAN environment.  The 
uncompressed BXML encoding is still the most efficient, performing 2.8 times as fast 
with transfers of the VMAP0 data and 2.2 times as fast with the MSD3 data. 


Utilizing an relational database system as the feature storage system imposes an 
unexpected high burden and is the major bottleneck in the LAN environment.  The 
overhead is so high that the effects of the different encodings tend to be largely muted, 
though BXML still technically performs the best.  CubeWerx will be investigating 
optimizations.  The use of a dual-processor server would like improve throughput 
significantly, since the Oracle activity during feature retrieval seems to be split between 
two processes which compete for CPU time.  (The server in the test environment has only 
one processor.) 


Using an external codec with an efficient GML generator imposes substantial costs in this 
environment because of the fixed cost of the additional XML-GML parse/generate 
step(s). 


14.3 Internet testing 


In the Internet environment, compression is very important because of the limited 
bandwidth, 150 Kbytes/sec in the test case.  Since the compressed sizes of BXML and 
XML data are quite similar, their performance was also quote similar.  While BZIP2 gave 
the greatest amount of compression, GZIP provides the greatest throughput and GZIP is a 
ubiquitous format. 


The sponsors of this project, including NGA, should insist that all of their software 
suppliers equip their GML-processing clients and servers with HTTP-based GZIP-
compression support.  Using the HTTP mechanism allows support to be optional for both 
client and server while providing compression when both client and server support it.  
GZIP is suitable for compressing streamed data on-the-fly. 


Using an relational database system to server the features slowed down the transfer 
significantly, though not to the degree experienced in the LAN environment.  Using 
either BXML encoding or compression gives similar throughput since the server in this 
case cannot saturate the network link except in the XML case, where the network 
becomes the bottleneck instead of the database system. 


Using an external codec with an efficient GML generator degrades performance, though 
not to the same degree as in the LAN case since the network is now the bottleneck and 
the client has more otherwise-idle CPU time with which to execute the external codec 
process.

14.4 Dial-up testing 


In the dial-up network case, compression is crucial.  BZIP2-compressed XML generally 
gives the best performance in this environment since it generally gives the best 
compression.

Introduction

GML [GML] is an increasingly important feature-encoding format for use in interoperable GIS systems.  Unfortunately, the innate text encoding that it uses is both bulky and slow to process.  To help GML realize its potential, its encoding efficiency should be made to be comparable with other commonly used feature-encoding formats, such as ESRI® Shapefile [SHAPE] format.  To this end, OGC has undertaken to test the compactness and system-throughput capacity of GML as encoded in numerous different ways, including binary encoding in BXML [BXML] and BinXML™ [BINXML] and general compression formats such as GZIP [GZIP] and BZIP2 [BZIP2].  The decision of potential GML adopters becomes much easier when they can have both interoperability and efficiency.

Encoding formats

It would informative to test the throughput and compactness of a number of feature-encoding formats, including GML-XML, GML-BXML, ESRI® Shapefile, and MapInfo® MIF, both with and without GZIP and BZIP2 compression.  The GML version will be 3.1.1 with the Simple Features [GML-SF] profile.  With binary encoding, we believe that the GML format can be much more competitive with binary formats such as Shapefile in terms of compactness and processing throughput.  MIF is an all-text format, which would be interesting to compare to GML-XML format.

Binary-encoding formats

BXML [BXML] is a straightforward patent-unencumbered binary-encoding format for XML data which is designed to be easy to implement and for which an open-source C-language reference implementation is freely available [CWXML].  It is also an OGC Discussion Paper.  One of its most important features for our immediate purposes is that it allows lists of floating-point coordinate values to be directly represented as raw-binary arrays.  This provides both compactness and system throughput since converting coordinate values to and from a text representation is surprisingly time-consuming.

BinXML™ is a commercial software product for which Galdos Systems is a reseller.  Galdos can better explain the strengths of BinXML™.

While a direct comparison of BXML and BinXML™ implemented in the same runtime environment would be desirable, CubeWerx does not have the resources or expertise to implement testing for BinXML™ in the scope of the OWS-3 project even if software licenses were provided.  However, an independent BinXML™ implementation in a different software architecture, such as a scripting-language/XML-tool environment relative to CubeWerx's RDBMS/C-language environment would still allow the direct comparison of encoding compactness and would provide an interesting performance characterization of the effectiveness of different encoding methods in the different GML-processing environments as well as a concrete comparison of the architectural approaches overall.

Data-compression formats

GZIP [GZIP] and BZIP2 [BZIP2] formats do an excellent job of compressing XML data.  In one rough example that was tested, GZIP achieved around an 80% compression rate (one-fifth the original size) and BZIP2 achieved around an 85% rate (one-sixth the original size) with GML data that had no unnecessary whitespace.  Specialized XML compression methods probably cannot out-compress GZIP and BZIP2 significantly in the general case.

However, the encoding and decoding of GZIP and BZIP2 formats are very CPU-intensive, so the “compaction” of the raw information before the “compression” step can have an large impact on overall system performance.  This trade-off is investigated.  Binary encodings of XML are considerably more compact than XML itself.

ZIP [ZIP] and compress [COMPRESS] compression formats are also in general use.  ZIP format does not need to be considered in this investigation because it generally uses exactly the same compression method that GZIP does, called “Deflate”.  It is also not a streamable format which imposes complications in a streaming client/server environment.  The compress method does not achieve as high a compression rate as GZIP (74% compression for the example) and, as it turns out, does not execute as quickly as GZIP, so it does not need to be considered in this study.  Historically, compress executed more efficiently than GZIP, however, use and refinement of the method stagnated for many years because of patent issues.

Complete format list

The complete list of GML-encoding combinations that should be tested for both compactness and throughput is as follows:

MDF is an high-performance format used by CubeWerx to load feature data into the Oracle database system.  It is a simple all-binary format in which geometries are stored in OGC Well-Known-Binary [WKB] format and the other properties are stored in fixed-sized fields.

One complication with the Shapefile, MIF, and MDF formats is that they are realized as a collection of multiple files instead of just one file.  The represented size will be the sum of the sizes of the constituent files that contain the equivalent information to GML format.  In a client/server environment, these files would need to be packaged together in an archive format such as ZIP or TAR [TAR], and the packaging requirement limits the potential streamability of the formats since the complete first file in the package must be available before the first record of the subsequent file is streamed out from a server.

For our testing purposes, it is sufficient to test the Shapefile and MIF formats only on a single machine to compare them with GML results on a single machine.  It would be a burden to incorporate these formats into the WFS interface, though it is technically feasible (when combined with a packaging format as mentioned above).

One capability lacking from GML that Shapefile has is that of random access.  BXML and presumably BinXML™ incorporate mechanisms for random access to elements based on identifier attributes, but this is not a spatial index.  A spatial index would be needed to access features spatially as Shapefile and MDF allow, but none is provided by the GML format.

Coordinate-value precision

An easy way to achieve data compaction in both the XML and BXML representations of GML data is to reduce the precision of the coordinate values in the features.  Coordinate values are normally represented as double-precision floating-point values in GIS systems and this is equivalent to about 16 significant decimal digits.  However, no real-world data is this accurate and some applications do not even need the full precision of the real data.  Sixteen decimal digits is equivalent to 4.4 nanometers (billionths of a meter) of resolution along the equator of the Earth.

The GML encoding should be tested with both double-precision coordinate values as well as single-precision in order to quantify the increased compactness.  Single precision is equivalent to about seven significant decimal digits or 2.4 meters of resolution along the equator.  BXML encoding has the capability to dynamically select different encodings for XML-Schema [XML-SCHEMA] content identified as “list of double,” such as GML coordinates values.

Intermediate precisions could also be tested.  This is easy to do with XML-encoded GML by selecting any integral number of significant decimal digits, though it is slightly more difficult to achieve with a binary encoding.  Floating-point doubles would best be used for this encoding with the least-significant bits of the mantissas zeroed out.  This data will have the same uncompressed size as with the full double precision, but it will compress better.  CubeWerx does not consider it to be worthwhile to investigate intermediate precisions at this time, though in the future, if systems have metadata about the absolute accuracy of the coorindate values in a feature collection, it could automatically select intermediate precisions individually for each feature type.

There is an indirect benefit to always using full double precision values in all calculations in a distributed system in that most computers implement IEEE 754-1995 [FLOATS] floating-point format in hardware so that most systems will compute similar or identical results and will behave more deterministically when making threshold decisions (e.g., “value >= 1e6”).  However, the increased compactness of using lesser precision in GML data may be a more important benefit.

Network environments

Testing should be conducted in the following environments: local file system (single machine), LAN (Local Area Network), Internet, and limited bandwidth (dial-up).

Local filesystem

It is very important to test GML-encoding performance on a single machine to determine directly and accurately the performance of the different GML encodings in isolation from confounding factors like network delays.  The most scientifically accurate methods should be applied in this experiment and measuring only in a distributed environment would be like measuring the dimensions of a book with a ruler that is marked only in integral feet.  Also, the encoding compactness will be the same as in local case as in the distributed case but will be easier to measure in the local case.  Testing on a local machine will also be necessary to compare against formats like Shapefile on their “home turf”.

LAN and Internet environments with WFS

GML is normally used to exchange geographic data in the LAN (Local-Area Network) within a single organization and over the Internet between organizations.  The purpose of testing in these network environments, considering that raw performance can be measured in a local-machine environment, is to demonstrate interoperability and to assess whether the raw performance differences are actually significant when combined with the network-transfer and WFS-processing costs of the normal GML usage environment.

The LAN and Internet environments have different performance characteristics and represent the common cases for distributed GML-processing systems.  Compression almost always makes sense in an Internet environment since modern computers can apply GZIP compression to at least 70 Mbits/sec of text GML data, thereby saturating even high-speed Internet links.  However, modern LANs operate at at least 100 Mbits/sec, which imposes a different cost structure on encodings.

WFS integration

Two methods are available to integrate alternate GML encodings into the WFS interface: the WFS output-format mechanism and the HTTP transfer-encoding mechanism.

The WFS interface provides a mechanism for selecting among different encodings for the feature data that it delivers.  The WFS 1.0.0 specification describes an optional attribute called “outputFormat” on the GetFeature request for which the default value is “GML2” in Section 9.2 on page 25.  The description on the same page also says:

The outputFormat attribute defines the format to use to generate the result set.  The default value is GML2 indicating that GML [2] shall be used.  Vendor specific formats (including non-XML and binary formats), declared in the capabilities document are also possible.  The available types are identified using <ResultFormat> tag of the Capabilities document.

In WFS version 1.1.0, the format identifiers are a little different.  The example in Section 9.2 shows the string as “text/xml; subtype=3.1.1”.  To request BXML, the equivalent would be “application/x-bxml; subtype=3.1.1”.  The Capabilities schema is a little hard to follow, but it looks like the Capabilities tag is <OutputFormatList>.

HTTP [HTTP], which the WFS interface is build on top of, also provides a built-in mechanism for requesting GZIP or compress encoding of the transferred content.  The client can include an “Accept-Encoding” MIME-header tag in the request message and the server has the option of responding with a “Content-Encoding” MIME-header tag in the reply message that indicates that the body is compressed.  The HTTP RFC does not explicitly spell out support for BZIP2 encoding, but it can logically be included by using either “x-bzip2” or even “bzip2” as the encoding-tag value.  The nature of the mechanism makes the use of ad-hoc symbols non-intrusive.  BXML encoding could even be requested in this way.

Since this content-encoding mechanism is built-in and optional, any WFS or WFS client has the option to support it and the data transfer will be optimized wherever possible.  All WFS clients and servers should support at least this mechanism.  Really, CubeWerx finds it rather mind-boggling that any production work would be attempted with GML in the Internet environment without at least using the HTTP mechanism for GZIP compression of the data stream.

External codec

An external codec is a piece of software that would be placed between a WFS client and server which would accept an XML-encoded GML stream from the WFS server, encode it into an alternate format, transport it to the client site, decode it back into XML-encoded GML and then pass it to the client application.

A general external codec has at least two major problems: it is complicated to implement since it essentially would be a distributed, cascading WFS; it is inefficient since it requires the parsing and generation of the GML data not once but three times, including two times as XML-encoded GML, which would most likely render it less efficient than directly GZIP-compressing a plain XML-encoded GML stream using the HTTP mechanism.

Limited-bandwidth network

A limited bandwidth environment can serve as a guide for wireless and dial-up cases where limited facilities are available.  A suitable speed it 56 kbps.  The general compression methods are expected to have the most significant impact in this environment, since the crucial performance factor will be minimizing the bandwidth usage.

Scalability

The scalability of GML data and processing systems should also be investigated.  This can be done easily using small, medium, and large data sets of the representative geometry types: points, lines, and polygons.  The testing definition of a ‘large’ data set is one with approximately 1-million features.

A GML-processing system based on utilizing a DOM (Document Object Model) approach to XML processing will have its scalability inherently limited to the number of features that can be stored in machine memory at one time, so GML-processing systems should not be based strictly on the DOM methodology.  Systems based on XSLT [XSLT] tools will have the same scalability problems for the same reason.

CubeWerx anticipates no inherent scalability problems with either the representation of or processing of a large number of GML features in its GML-processing systems.  The CWXML [CWXML] open-source library utilized by CubeWerx provides a node/subtree mechanism that supplies the convenience of a DOM mechanism with the scalability of  the streamable SAX mechanism.

Since the sponsor-supplied MSD3 data totals only in the thousands of features, VMAP0 data is used to conduct scalability testing.

Testing approach and environment

Sample application

The two kinds of “performance” to be measured in the GML Performance Investigations are system throughput (speed) and information-encoding compactness.  To test throughput, the various software levels of a representative GML-processing application are measured in a number of usage environments.  The compactness can be determined by measuring the size of the same GML feature data as encoded and compressed by the various different means.

A representative GML-processing application is the fetching and rendering of a stream of GML data into a displayable image.  The application has the following software levels which can be characterized independently and in combination:

		fetch features from underlying system



		generate features in GML



		transport features



		parse features into internal programming-language structures



		render features into raster





Feature rendering is not strictly necessary for measuring GML performance, but it provides concrete visible proof that all of the features of a data set were actually processed and it supplies an interesting comparison of the performance of two different architectures for SLD [SLD] styling that have been pursued by OGC participants: native implementation vs. XML tools.  Most GIS-product vendors including CubeWerx use the native-implementation approach.  Galdos uses an XML-tools approach.  Proponents have long advocated the benefits of each approach.  Also, the software to render features is already available in the testing environments anyway, and the timing of the rendering component can easily be computed and factored out of the GML-transfer components.

Test data

An MSD3 data set was supplied by the project sponsors which is defined relative to a large central XML Schema and some VMAP0 data was selected by the participants since it has more bulk for reliable testing and it has small schemas.  The VMAP0 data selected is described in clause 11 and the MSD3 data is described in clause 12.

Testing methodology

The general measuring methodology employed is to run each test case four times and discard the first run and average the subsequent three.  The first run may involve variable system-caching overheads that would be difficult to measure reliably.  In some cases, it is not feasible to perform four runs of every combination because it would take too long.

All time measurements are for real elapsed “wall-clock” time.  This is the time of principal concern to most users.  (Other conceivable timing measurements include CPU-processing time.)

All figures for file sizes, transfer speeds, use SI unit-multiplier prefixes, which are normally base-10 [SI] but include a special notation for base-2 [SI-BIN].  For example, 1 KB means exactly 1,000 bytes and 1 KiB means exactly 1,024 bytes.

Testing environment

The computer selected to be the server for the network test cases and the host for the local-file-system test case has the following specifications:

		Processor: AMD® Athlon-64 3200+ (64-bit), 2.01 GHz, 512 KiB cache



		Main memory: 1 GiB dual-channel DDR-400 MHz (PC-3200)



		Hard drive: single 200-GB SATA 3-GB/s channel



		HD sustained read speed: 63.73 MB/sec



		OS: Fedora Core 4 Linux for x86-64 (2.6.12 kernel)



		Compiler: GCC 4.0.1 with -O3 optimization



		File system: Linux ext3 journaling type





Its name is “a64.cubewerx.com”.

The computer selected to be the client for network testing is a laptop model with the following specifications:

		Processor: Intel® Pentium-4 Mobile (32-bit), 2.00 GHz, 512 KiB cache



		Main memory: 512 KiB



		Hard drive: single 40-GB ATA U100



		HD sustained read speed: 30.08 MB/sec



		OS: Fedora Core 4 Linux for i686 (2.6.12 kernel)



		Compiler: GCC 4.0.1 with -O3 optimization



		File system: Linux ext3 journaling type





Testing tools

The following tools are be used in the testing:

		cwcat – simple command-line file copier



		cwdump – simple command-line feature-file displayer/copier



		cwplot – simple command-line feature-file plotter with SLD support



		xmlscan – simple command-line XML file copier/converter



		CWXML – XML/BXML parser/generator library



		CubeSERV® WFS – Oracle®-based Web Feature Service



		gzip – open-source compression library



		bzip2 – open-source compression library





The cwcat program is modeled after the Unix® cat program but has special features including the capability to read from remote URLs (as do all of the “cw” programs) and to limit the throughput of the data it copies.  This latter feature is used to simulate Internet and dial-up networks as described in clause 10.7.

The cwdump program includes the capability to generate GML data in a CGI environment and this capability is used to implement the simulated high-performance WFS that is used for some test cases.  The implementation is described in clause 10.8.

The xmlscan program is included with the open-source CWXML library and is handy for reformatting and ‘pretty printing’ XML/BXML data.

Version 1.2.3 of the gzip compression library is used.  The maximum compression level of ‘9’ is used since the library can produce data at this compression level much faster than the LAN can absorb it, so it is better to maximize the amount of compression.  Recent versions of this library include significant performance improvements over older versions.  The library-default compression level is ‘6’.

Version 1.0.3 of the bzip2 compression library is used.  The bzip2 compression level of ‘9’ is used, which is the maximum and the library default.

Local-file-system testing

Reading-speed testing was performed by using a script that translates the source data from the GML-XML distribution format into the format to be tested and then reads the data four times in a loop.  After the first read, the file content will be cached in memory, assuming that it fits, and subsequent reads show be as efficient as the format allows.

Writing-speed testing was performed using the same approach as the reading testing, except that the time taken to read from the source-data format (uncompressed GML encoded in XML) is subtracted from the total read+write time, giving only the writing time.

Network simulation

Early Internet testing was attempted using the real Internet, but the results were far too variable minute-by-minute and day-by-day to produce results that were actually comparable to each other.  Instead, this testing is carried out using the CubeWerx internal 100-Mbps LAN with the server CGI shell-script program augmented to pass the outgoing data through cwcat used as a precise flow-controlling filter.  This filter is so light-weight that it does not influence the results and its operation closely simulates what happens with normal Internet transfers: the outgoing data from the generator program gets queued up in the outgoing socket buffers until the generator process is suspended while the data is slowly emptied onto the outgoing network connection.

The data rate selected for Internet testing is 150 Kbytes/sec, which represents a decent Internet connection between any two points in North America or perhaps the world.  Because of the structure of the interaction as a small request with a single large reply, it is not necessary to simulate packet latency (ping times) since TCP/IP is a sliding-window protocol that quite effectively hides packet latency for large transfers, but a 60-millisecond latency is added on the server side anyway.

The data rate selected for Dial-up testing is 5.6 Kbytes/sec, which corresponds to 56 Kbits/sec uncompressed.  A response latency of 200 milliseconds is inserted on the server side.

The LAN used is a lightly loaded 100-Mbps Ethernet system with the server and laptop client directly connected to the network.  Pinging the server from the client takes an average of 0.141 milliseconds and the sustained HTTP data-transfer rate is 11.70 MB/second.

WFS simulation

CubeWerx had insufficient time to fully integrate the needs of the MSD3 data into the CubeSERV transactional WFS, so a light-weight simulated WFS was implemented with this capability by building on the cwdump feature-displaying utility.  This utility is so efficient that it serves a second important purpose which is to determine what transfer costs are caused by the network as opposed to the relational-database system used by the full-feature WFS.  As it turns out, the RDBMS is quite costly.

The simulated WFS has a simple CGI interface and it  reads features from BXML-encoded GML files stored on the server and it recodes them on the fly according to the received request into XML or BXML encoding with GZIP, BZIP2, or no compression.  In the case that uncompressed BXML is requested, the full re-coding process is still carried out for timing consistency.  The returned GML data references a schema which is also generated by the web application on request to be encoded in the same way as the GML data for the VMAP0 test data and which is copied directly from a pre-encoded schema file on the server for MSD3 data.  These methods correspond to the way these data sets would normally be used, since the MSD3 data is defined relative to a fixed central schema.

For example, the following request for XML+GZIP:

http://a64.cubewerx.com/ows3/simfs/simfs.cgi?REQUEST=GetFeature&TYPENAME=builtupa&OUTPUTFORMAT=text/xml%3Bencoding%3Dgzip

will reference its schema as:

http://a64.cubewerx.com/ows3/simfs/simfs.cgi?REQUEST=DescribeFeatureType&TYPENAME=builtupa&OUTPUTFORMAT=text/xml%3Bencoding%3Dgzip

The testing carried out is only to fetch and internally plot the requested data using the cwplot application, excluding the time taken to write out the resulting PNG image from the internal raster representation.  The features received at the client are not stored; each is discarded immediately after plotting.

Thus, the execution time will include reading and re-coding the source data on the server, transferring it over the network, parsing the data into internal C-language feature representations, and plotting it into a C-language raster representation.  The translation from GML to internal the C-language structures provides a means of validating the data in terms of properties and data types, though this is a different from from XML-Schema-based validation.

The plotting speed turns out to be so fast that plotting adds virtually no overhead to the process, so it is safe to include here.  Also, the data is fully streamed, so if the client can process the data more quickly than the network can deliver it, the client operations will effectively have no cost.  The same is true of the server if it can supply the data faster than the network can absorb it.

VMAP0-data testing

The following feature collections from the VMAP0 data are used for testing, in order of the number of features per collection:

		Collection

		Description

		Geom Type

		Properties

		Features

		Vertices



		builtupa

		Built-up Areas

		Polygon

		6

		8,346

		17.3



		inwatera

		Inland Water Bodies

		Polygon

		6

		153,358

		19.2



		elevp

		Elevation Points

		Point

		8

		175,880

		1.0



		watrcrsl

		Water Courses

		LineString

		6

		290,528

		8.9



		coutourl

		Contour Lines

		LineString

		7

		1,099,837

		30.7





The terms “feature type” and “feature collection” can be used interchangeably here, since each feature collection includes features of exactly one type.  The “Properties” column gives the number of properties in the features; the “Features” column gives the number of features in each feature collection; and the “Vertices” column gives the average number of vertices in the geometry of each feature, which indicates how complex the geometries are.  (The start/end point of a polygon ring is counted as two vertices.)  This data set includes feature-collection sizes of medium volume to large volume.  The contourl feature collection is suitable for demonstrating the scalability of the processing applications.

The source VMAP0 geometries have single-precision coordinate values, so versions of the elevp and watrcrsl feature collections were created that have double-precision coordinate values for comparison purposes.  Use of the double-precision versions is specifically noted.

The reading results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows:

		20,658





The compression type indicated as “indented” is not compression at all but means that the text file was “pretty printed” with an indentation of two spaces for each XML-tag level.  As expected, it makes the uncompressed version of the file significantly large; however, it does not add significantly to the gzip-compressed size or time.  This extra whitespace compresses very well.

In general, the GZIP compression/decompression method operates faster than expected.  It will likely be made faster still in the future when certain hashing-table patents expire.

We fixed a performance bug in the BXML parser during the course of this testing that caused it to unnecessarily convert numeric property values to text before re-converting them back to numbers for the reading application.  This resulted in a 40% performance increase.

The GML reader is not that heavily optimized.  It uses the node/subtree interface of the CWXML library, which reads in DOM-like subtrees for each feature but only holds one feature in memory at a time.  In contrast, the GML writer uses a node-by-node approach and its performance of 117,549 given below shows how much faster that approach can be.  The node-subtree approach is easier to program for reading, however, and some modest optimization attempts showed that reading features is harder to optimize than writing them.

Reading alternate formats

The reading results for the builtupa feature collection represented in alternative formats to GML are as follows:

		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)

		Time (s)

		Speed (F/s)



		Shapefile

		(binary+text)

		none

		3.70

		0.047

		178,143



		MIF

		(text)

		none

		3.25

		0.249

		33,558



		MDF

		(binary)

		none

		3.62

		0.031

		267,819





The relevant comparison here is to GML encoded in BXML at 55.3 kF/s and XML at 15.7 kF/s.  The MIF text format can be processed twice as fast as XML-encoded GML and Shapefile can be processed 3.2 times as fast as BXML-encoded GML.  This is a little surprising and disappointing, given that Shapefile numeric properties are actually stored in a text representation.  CubeWerx MDF format performs 4.9 times as fast as BXML-encoded GML.  It should also be noted that both Shapefile and MDF formats always store coordinate values as double-precision floats, but they still out-perform BXML-encoded GML.

The processing performance of these alternate formats when compressed was not tested, but the compressed sizes were measured as follows:

		Format

		Encoding

		Compression

		Size (MB)



		Shapefile

		(binary+text)

		gzip

		1.45



		Shapefile

		(binary+text)

		bzip2

		bzip2

		0.94



		MDF

		(binary)

		gzip

		1.49



		MDF

		bzip2

		1.17





The compressed sizes are comparable to but not quite as good as the GML compressed sizes, except for MIF format, which is more compact in all cases.

Writing

The writing results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows:

		Format

		GML

		BXML

		bzip2

		1.053

		0.791

		10,551





The reported timings for the writing speed are reduced by the 0.533 seconds taken to read the source builtupa data.  There is quite a spike in the performance of the uncompressed BXML case, since this format is very efficient to write.

Plotting

The plotting results for the builtupa feature collection are as follows:

		Format

The plotting window is between longitudes -180 and 0 and latitudes -40 to 90 and is size 3600 pixels horizontal by 2600 vertical and the output image type is PNG.  The writing time of the PNG file is excluded from the time.  The SLD styling symbol uses a light-pink fill (#EEA9B8) with a dark-pink outline (#FFC0CB).  A scaled down version (to reduce document size) of the resulting image is included here:



The data is rather sparse, but this test demonstrates that the full North American coverage has been processed in our testing.

If we eliminate the GML-data-reading time, the internal plotting time is only around 0.080 seconds for a speed of around 104,000 features per second.  While this performance is not strictly what is to be measured in this experiment, it would be very interesting to see how well a GML-XSLT-SVG plotting system performs.  We suspect not as well.  A system needs to be fast at plotting features in order to offer an effective WMS interface.

The GML-XML-uncompressed case likely includes file-cache-miss effects, since the file size is just short of the amount of physical memory on the machine, but the effect is most likely not significant, since the performance is consistent with the GML-XML-gzip case.

The reported timings for the writing speeds are reduced by the 77.809 seconds taken to read the source contourl data.

These results most likely include file-cache-miss effects.  However, this effect appears to be limited, since if the testing tool is limited to processing only the first 200,000 features (which will fit into the file-cache memory), the feature throughput is only about 4.5% faster.

The plotting window covers the whole world and the image is 3600 pixels across by 1800 (with a scaled-down version included here).  The SLD plotting style uses brown strokes (#808000):

The raw internal plotting speed is around 254,000 features per second.

Conclusions

Uncompressed BXML provided the fastest reading, writing, and plotting performances for local file-system testing.  This is the expected result.  Averaging the single-precision test cases, BXML format files were only 40% as large as the uncompressed-XML files; they were read 4.0 times as fast for an average of 71,606 features/second; and they were written 8.2 times as fast for an average of 117,760 features/second.

Using compression in the local file system just slows down the performance.  This would only be recommended to conserve space.  The compressed file sizes between BXML and XML are quite similar, but the compressed BXML files could be read and written much faster than the compressed XML files.

Using double precision coordinate values produces files that are significantly larger and take significantly more time to process.  This is as expected.

The BXML encoding of GML falls far short of the reading performance of Shapefile and CubeWerx MDF formats.  Shapefile, the golden standard, can be read an average of 3.0 times as fast as the BXML-encoded GML format.

The plotting performance of the CubeWerx SLD renderer is astonishingly high.

There are competing factors in the determination of the performance in this environment: the encoding, the compressing and decompressing, and the network bandwidth.  The network in this case is fairly high in bandwidth and compression is fairly expensive.  The client-side CPU utilization showed up as being between 8% and 43%, with the former for uncompressed data and the latter for bzip2-compressed data.

It is interesting that the XML+gzip case is faster than the XML-uncompressed case, as opposed to most other feature types where the uncompressed data is faster.  In this case, the GML file contains a much greater amount of redundancy than the other feature types since the quasi-random coordinate data occupies a much smaller portion of the file and the XML tags a much greater portion.  The file ends up being compressed to such a degree that the faster transfer speed improves the overall performance.  Or, it could be that the GZIP compressor is disproportionately slow at compressing quasi-random numbers.

Conclusions

Uncompressed BXML still gives the best performance in the LAN environment with the simulated WFS, performing an average of 2.8 times as fast as XML encoding over the seven test cases.

Gzip compression is much more competitive in this environment and was actually faster than uncompressed data in a couple of instances.  Bzip2 compression is still too CPU-bound to be competitive in this environment.

These results are somewhat disappointing and show that accessing a relational database incurs a substantial time overhead.  The close similarity of all the timings regardless of encoding format show that accessing this data from the database has a fixed cost of around 25 seconds relative to a few seconds of difference for processing the different encodings, rendering the encoding unimportant in this environment.

There are competing factors in the determination of the performance in this environment: the encoding, the compressing and decompressing, and the network bandwidth.  The network in this case is fairly low in bandwidth and compression is relatively inexpensive, so file size is the major determinate of performance.

One would need to be crazy not to compress GML data being sent over the Internet.

The simulated high-performance network is efficient enough to saturate the network in all cases except for using bzip2 compression, but it comes close even then.

Conclusions

Compression is the most important factor in this test environment.  Since the compressed sizes of BXML and XML are quite similar, the performance was also quite similar.  Using bzip2 compression frequently gave the best performance, though bzip2 applied to XML was substantially slower than the other encodings since BXML is slow to execute and XML gives the compression method a bulky input stream.

The network was the bottleneck in the uncompressed-XML test case but retrieving the features from the database was the bottleneck in the rest of the cases.  The throughput was about 145 kbytes/sec in the uncompressed-XML case but only 93 kbytes/sec in the uncompressed-BXML test case (significantly less than the network bandwidth).  Applying compression increases the elapsed time since retrieving features from the database is already a CPU-intensive activity, and compression adds to the CPU-power bottleneck.  The XML+bzip2 test case achieves a network utilization of only 33 kbytes/sec.  The other feature types below follow a similar pattern.

Conclusions

Using a relational database shows less overhead in the Internet environment, though full network utilization is not achieved for the non-uncompressed-XML test cases.  The other encodings are compact enough that the CPU and database access on the server is the bottleneck.

Dial-up testing

This testing was carried out using the same simulated method as with the Internet testing.  In this case, the link speed was set to 5,600 bytes/second to correspond to a 56-kbit/second low-speed link.  No built-in compression was simulated over the link.

Transferring any volume of data over the link is obviously very slow and is completely dominated by the link speed.  The CPU utilization on the client was shown as 0% to 2%.

Very limited plotting performance was measured for the inwatera feature collection:

This test case ran for approximately six hours.

Extrapolated results

The testing for the dial-up case is extremely time-consuming and the results have been demonstrated to be determined by the link speed, so presented here is an extrapolation of the testing of all seven feature collections being concatenated together (2,194,357 features):

If all these test cases were executed once in practice, it would take over seven days.

Conclusions

Dial-up links are very slow, so the GML encoding with the greatest compression will have the highest throughput.  In this case, bzip2 gives the best compression and therefore, the best throughput.  The bzip2 file sizes are slightly smaller for XML than BXML, so XML+bzip2 gives the best throughput.

MSD3-data testing

It would not be feasible or greatly useful to perform manual testing on all of the individual feature types, so four instances were chosen for manual testing to represent the MSD3 data set: three feature collections of varying geometry type plus an aggregation of all the feature types.  The aggregation was obtained simply by concatenating together all of the <gml:featureMember> elements of the supplied GML feature collections.  The schema references were also changed to be locally available and offered up with the different encodings of the test instances (e.g., XML, BXML, compressed).  The source data is all three-dimensional, but two-dimensional versions are also tested.

The following feature collections from the MSD3 data are used for testing:

		Collection

The “Properties” column gives the average number of properties per feature present in the MSD3 collection, excluding the topology property (since it is not processed).  The “Vertices” column is the average number of vertices per geometry for all feature collections.

Two versions of the MSD3 schema were available for testing: the full version and a version with all of the <appinfo> metadata trimmed out of it.  The major reporting of results is for the trimmed version of the schema with additional comments about the performance with the full schema.

The testing of 3D coordinate values versus 2D coordinate values is reported only for the MSD3-aggregation feature collection.  The performance difference between 2D and 3D is not that large and the aggregation case shows the difference sufficiently.

Local file-system testing

The GML and schema files were tested using local files.

The source-data reading time of 1.621 seconds is subtracted from the write timings above.  Note that no new schema file is written out here since the generated GML data refers to a preexisting schema file.

The XML encodings of the compressed data are significantly smaller than the BXML versions.  This is likely because BXML format compacts the data with the primary goal being for speed of processing whereas GZIP and BZIP2 formats compact data with the primary goal being minimization of size.

There does not appear to be a great performance advantage in using 2D coordinates over 3D ones.  This is presumably because the extra coordinate dimension takes a relatively small amount of space compared to all of the attributes.  The difference would be larger if the geometries in the MSD3 data included significantly more vertices.

As discussed with the MSD3-aggregate case, parsing the schema takes a substantial amount of the elapsed time.  However, since this feature collection is much smaller and the schema-parsing time is fixed for each different encoding, schema parsing now takes the majority of the elapsed time.

Conclusions

Uncompressed BXML encoding gives the best performance in the local-file-system test case.  Since the MSD3 3D case actually includes the data for the other test cases, it is the most representative one.  The BXML format was 1.85 times as fast as XML and was only 53% as large for using the trimmed schema.

A large performance factor with this data is the schema, since it is so large relative to the data.  Two versions were tested, a trimmed version and the full version which includes a great deal of metadata.  Both versions include definitions for hundreds of feature types that are not present in the test data set.

The BXML version of the trimmed schema is 43% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.34 times as fast.  The BXML version of the full schema is 46% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.88 times as fast.  Parsing the trimmed schema takes 27% of the BXML execution time.

Compression gives poor performance in this environment because the compression algorithms are slow to execute.  However, if storage size is the crucial restriction, then XML+bzip2 gives the best compression, though it is much slower to execute than gzip compression.

The BXML compressed files are substantially larger than the XML compressed file.  The reason for this is not known.

Processing 2D data versus 3D data did not make a substantial difference in either the processing time or the file size.  This is likely because the features have relatively few vertices per geometry and have a large number of properties, so the extra coordinate in the 3D data does not take a substantial amount of extra space.

LAN testing

The BXML format includes a central symbol table and a mechanism to make any text content reference a string in this table.  The advantage is that a literal string value need appear in the BXML file only once and it can be referenced by a compact index value thereafter.  The option is enabled in the BXML generator for the MSD3 network cases to make all generated content strings use this central symbol table for greater compactness.  

The reason this option was not enabled in the file-system testing is that there appears to be a performance bug in the CWXML library that makes processing referenced strings a little slower than literal strings.  However, in the network environment, the increased compactness of the volume of data sent over the network provides better performance than using the literal strings.

External codec

An external codec (encoder-decoder, external to the main GML-consuming program) was added to the LAN testing script by adding a Unix shell statement of the form:

 xmlscan -url data_url -pack | cwplot -f - parameters

This executes the xmlscan program which reads the GML data from the server as a separate process from the cwplot program which plots the data.  The xmlscan program reads the data in whatever format is requested from the server but always delivers it to the cwplot program as uncompressed XML, so this arrangement operates as an “external codec” for delivering GML data to a client application that does not understand BXML or the compression formats.  A caveat is that it would be very awkward to intercept the retrieval of the schemas, so only the GML data is subjected to the external codec, not the schema access.  Also, this external codec is implemented only on the client side; the external codec could be extended onto the server side as discussed in clause 8.4 which would impose greater costs and complications for recognizing and translating coordinate values and other numbers.

This arrangement is functionality equivalent to the direct MSD3 test, except the external codec will create more execution overhead on the client from managing multiple processes and in interprocess pipe and from executing an extra decoding and encoding step.  Additionally, the extra encoding step will be for regular XML and the decoding step inside of the cwplot program will always be for regular XML-encoded GML.

The plotting results for the MSD3 3D feature collection using the external codec are as follows (sizes in KB, times in seconds, speeds in features/second):

The results show that the use of an external codec imposes significant throughput costs in the Internet environment and the benefits of using BXML in this environment are largely nullified.  The lost performance would be significantly larger if the schema fetching was also run through an external codec.

Note that the XML-none figure does not really belong here since the main application in this arrangement can consume regular XML directly, so an external codec is not really needed in this case.

Conclusions

The uncompressed BXML encoding gives the best performance in the LAN test case, same as with the VMAP0 data.  The BXML format was 2.2 times as fast as XML and was only 28% as large for using the trimmed schema.  Using the symbol-table BXML mechanism makes the BXML files substantially smaller here than in the file-system testing where it was turned off.

Schema processing is a large factor with the MSD3 data.  The BXML verison of the trimmed schema is 26% as large as the XML version and can be processed 1.59 times as fast.  The BXML version of the full schema is 28% as large as the XML version and can be processed 2.5 times as fast.  Parsing the trimmed schema takes 20% of the BXML execution time.  The schemas compress extremely well.

Compression performs better in this environment than in the file-system environment because there is a trade-off between processing time taken to compress the data and the effectively increased network throughput of the compressed data.  However, the LAN is fast enough that the processing time is more costly.  The BXML compressed data files are substantially larger than the XML compressed file.  The reason for this is not known.

Using an external codec adds a substantial overhead in this environment and tends to even out the timings because of the large fixed overhead of the fixed XML-GML generate/parse steps.

The results here are quite different from the LAN test case.  The primary difference is that in this case, the client CPU is largely idle in the direct-connection case, so the resources are readily available to execute the external codec and while keeping up with the server.  There is no obvious explanation for why the uncompressed cases actually experience performance improvements, though there may be some subtle effects in the network-simulation implementation.

The cases where the performance is significantly worse is probably related to the fixed overhead of executing the decode-generate-decode steps on the client.  The break-even point seems to be around the 14-second period of the XML-bzip2 case, though in this case, the server would be very busy executing the expensive bzip2-compression algorithm.  Indeed, in this case, the server can only generate 37 kbytes/sec over the simulated 150-kbyte/sec link.  The server is nearly able to saturate the link in the gzip test cases, and so would deliver the maximum concentration of features per second.  In the uncompressed cases, the network is the bottleneck, so the number of features per second that the client needs to process is restricted.

Conclusions

Compression is crucial to performance in the Internet environment because of the limited network bandwidth.  However, while bzip2 compression gives the greatest compactness, gzip gives the better throughput.

The XML+gzip case gives the best throughput in this environment.  The portion time taken parsing the schema is substantially lower in this environment than in the LAN environment because the schemas compress incredibly well.

Using an external codec adds greatly less overhead than in the LAN environment because the client machine has much more idle time while waiting for data to come from the network that it can spend on the fixed cost of the fixed XML-GML generate/parse steps.

Dial-up testing

Dial-up testing is carried out using a simulated 5.6-kbyte/sec uncompressed link.

Conclusions

With a dial-up link, compression is crucial to performance.  Whatever encoding method produces the fewest bytes to represent a feature collection will be the fastest, pretty much regardless of how much processing the encoding method takes.  In the case of the MSD3 data, the best encoding method for dial-up links is XML+bzip2.

GML issues

In the course of carrying out this performance study, some problem areas with using GML were identified.

The trouble with application schemas

There are two general approaches to handling the schemas associated with GML data.  One way is to auto-generate a custom-tailored schema for each GML file that is generated from the information available from the source feature format, as was done for the VMAP0 test data set, and the other way is to use an external, centralized schema, as was done for the MSD3 test data set.

Using a custom-tailored schema is the approach taken with most other feature formats, with the schema information normally embedded within the data file(s).  A vulnerability with this approach is the fidelity with which the schema information is carried from one representation to another.  Sometimes, the sizes of properties or letter case of names are changed, and most feature formats have tricky idiosyncrasies.  For example, in Shapefile format, numeric types are actually stored as strings, and a numeric type with width=9 and scale=3 can actually store any number that can be represented in nine characters.  Some tools even write numbers in scientific notation.

Using the centralized-schema approach has problems also.  One major problem is that the centralized schema may include a great number of feature-type definitions and a great deal of metadata that is not relevant to the purpose at hand.  For example, the MSD3 central schema includes definitions for 443 different feature types even though the sponsor-supplied data includes only 93 feature types and 83% of the bulk of the full schema contains metadata which is not relevant to the performance-testing activities of the OWS-3 project.  The schema is so large that parsing it takes a significant portion of the time to read the MSD3 data and it even takes the majority of the time for smaller feature collections.

The other major problem with centralized application schemas is that it is easy to include arbitrary formatting declarations that general-purpose GML client and server applications cannot understand or follow.  This problem is present with custom-generated schemas also, though the arbitrariness is limited in practice to the types of declarations that are portable between common representation formats.  For instance, if the data is held in a relational-database format using simple types (plus a geometry), then the generated schema will reflect this simplicity.

Handling arbitrary schema declarations may be an unsolvable computing problem in the general case and is at least a complex artificial-intelligence problem since in order for a computer to transform data from one representation into an arbitrary new one, it needs to “understand” the semantics of the information, and arbitrary semantics probably are not representable in a declarative way.

Schema-processing in the centralized-schema approach is particularly onerous because the schema theoretically needs to be parsed and understood in order to even write the GML data correctly, whereas with the custom-generated schema approach the GML writer is easily and statically preprogrammed to generate its output GML in accordance with the schema that it generates.  In practice, however, vendors will not implement a capability to “understand” the schema of the GML data they are writing; they will instead simply implement application-specific hacks into their GML generators to handle any arbitrariness in the application schemas.

It is also possible to implement any arbitrary transformations needed for generated data using a hand-made application-specific transformation script as a post-processing step and to do the reverse in the same way on the client side.  However, beyond the manual effort involved in creating and managing the transformation programs to service all of the different feature types in a data set, portable transformation programs are generally written in XSLT, which, given the way that XSLT operates, is likely to be inefficient and may not work at all for large feature sets like the Contour Lines of the VMAP0 test data since XSTL implementations tend to store the entire XML stream in memory, which also imposes streamability limitations.  It is theoretically possible to optimize XSLT to behave in a streamable fashion where the transformation to be carried out permits, but this optimization is not yet available in real-world XSLT implementations, but even if it is available, the XML stream still needs to be parsed and generated an additional time.

However, there is a fairly easy way around the problems of dealing with arbitrary XML schemas, which is to use simplified canonical profiles of GML and XML-Schema, such as the GML Simple-Features Profile [GML-SF].  If both the application schema and the GML generator conform to the profile (or specific compliance level of future versions of the profile), and if the source format for the generator retains the typing information of the schema with the full fidelity of the schema profile, then the generated GML will always conform to the central application schema.

GML MeasureType

A practical problem with gml:MeasureType is that the attributes take a fairly large amount of space in the GML data files, whereas the measurement unit for individual properties all appear to be constant in the MSD3 data.  It would be much more space-efficient if the if the fixed unit associated with each measurement property in the MSD3 data could be specified once in the schema definition or metadata rather than being repeated in-line with every property instance.

The presence of the attribute on every property instance also imposes the need on consumers to re-map and retain this information for every measurement property instance when the data is transformed into another feature format in order to maintain the fidelity of the data, since the consumer will not know in advance (or really, ever) that the unit is actually fixed.  This information may be awkward to re-map and will be time- and space-consuming in other feature representations.  This author is not aware of any other format that includes a variable-unit mechanism.

GML streamability

A format is “streamable” if it can be generated, transfered, and consumed without any undue storage between the end points.  Streamability is desirable because it minimizes processing delays and storage costs throughout the system.  However, there are a few features of GML that interfere with its streamability.

Mid-stream errors

A GML feature collection can include features from numerous different feature types and the WFS interface allows requests to be made for multiple feature types and this can cause streamability issues on the server side since many systems implement the storage of features of different types using a separate internal feature collection for each different type.  Also, all OWS requests require the response to be either a valid document of the requested format or to be a specially coded exception report.

The way that a query that includes multiple feature types is normally implemented is to process the feature-type queries in order and generate the GML output.  But this poses a big problem if any errors are encountered in the intermediate steps, since if any errors are encountered at any point during the GML-generation process, an exception report must be generated instead of a GML document.  GML includes no mechanism for reporting an error after the generation of the stream has begun.

In order for a generating application to be (mostly) safe is to generate all of the output data to a temporary file and then copy this file to the network, but then the generation time is wasted.  This problem is compounded in the Internet environment because the network is usually the bottleneck and it will be idle while the temporary file is generated.  

Really, the only sane approach for WFS implementers is to cheat in some way.

Bounding envelope

The requirement that the bounding envelope be stated at the beginning of a feature stream is desirable for clients, but it imposes restrictions on streamability for servers.  The only way to be sure that the tightest envelope is stated in the general case is to pre-scan all of the features according to all of the query constraints.

Feature interleaving

Another streamability issue is that features in a GML feature collection may appear in any order and be mixed together.  This poses no problems for GML generators since they can choose any order which is convenience, but it does pose problems for GML consumers since many client applications cannot process a sequence of more than one feature type at a time.  If only one feature type is in a stream, a clever client with the one-feature-type-at-a-time constraint can process it in one pass, but this is not possible if more than one feature type is present in the stream.  The client would need to either store or re-retrieve the stream when it is ready to process the next feature type.

GML should include some mechanism to indicate whether or not the features of a type are contiguous and/or appear in the order of the feature types in the schema.  This would allow simple applications to process a GML stream one feature-type at a time in one pass.

Conclusions

Local file-system testing

Testing in the local file system showed that binary encoding using BXML was around four times as fast for reading and eight times as fast for writing GML data compared to XML for the VMAP0 test data.  The performance figures for the MSD3 data showed a lower overall improvement because the parsing of the bulky application schema is conflated with the data encode/decode speeds.  When factored out, the BXML reading is about twice as fast and the writing is about three times as fast.  The MSD3 data has many more properties than the VMAP0 data.

We also need to be cognizant in general that the CWXML parser is extremely well optimized for scanning XML and BXML realized in other environments may be even more efficient than comparable XML parsers since the BXML format is quite easy to process efficiently.

The BXML files are around 40% the size of the XML files and can be smaller still if space-saving options are enabled, and there are design tweaks that can be applied to future versions of BXML to increase compactness.  When compression is applied, the BXML files are frequently around the same size as the XML files, though sometimes the BXML files can be significantly larger, as with the MSD3 data files.  The XML encoding of MSD3 has the advantage that the source data is rounded to ten significant decimal digits, but these are not round values when represented in binary, which reduces the compressibility of the BXML representation.  The compressed BXML files are still substantially faster to process than the compressed XML files, especially with the relatively efficient GZIP method.

Using double-precision coordinate values with the VMAP0 data produced files that were significantly larger and slower to process than using single-precision coordinates.  However, using 2D coordinate values instead of 3D coordinate values with the MSD3 data did not make a significant difference in size or processing speed, likely because the coordinate values occupy a relatively small portion of the overall MSD3-data size.

The BXML encoding of GML falls far short of the performance available with other feature-file formats.  Shapefile can be read about three times faster than BXML-encoded GML.

LAN testing

The speed and size savings of BXML translate well to the LAN environment.  The uncompressed BXML encoding is still the most efficient, performing 2.8 times as fast with transfers of the VMAP0 data and 2.2 times as fast with the MSD3 data.

Utilizing an relational database system as the feature storage system imposes an unexpected high burden and is the major bottleneck in the LAN environment.  The overhead is so high that the effects of the different encodings tend to be largely muted, though BXML still technically performs the best.  CubeWerx will be investigating optimizations.  The use of a dual-processor server would like improve throughput significantly, since the Oracle activity during feature retrieval seems to be split between two processes which compete for CPU time.  (The server in the test environment has only one processor.)

Using an external codec with an efficient GML generator imposes substantial costs in this environment because of the fixed cost of the additional XML-GML parse/generate step(s).

Internet testing

In the Internet environment, compression is very important because of the limited bandwidth, 150 Kbytes/sec in the test case.  Since the compressed sizes of BXML and XML data are quite similar, their performance was also quote similar.  While BZIP2 gave the greatest amount of compression, GZIP provides the greatest throughput and GZIP is a ubiquitous format.

The sponsors of this project, including NGA, should insist that all of their software suppliers equip their GML-processing clients and servers with HTTP-based GZIP-compression support.  Using the HTTP mechanism allows support to be optional for both client and server while providing compression when both client and server support it.  GZIP is suitable for compressing streamed data on-the-fly.

Using an relational database system to server the features slowed down the transfer significantly, though not to the degree experienced in the LAN environment.  Using either BXML encoding or compression gives similar throughput since the server in this case cannot saturate the network link except in the XML case, where the network becomes the bottleneck instead of the database system.

Using an external codec with an efficient GML generator degrades performance, though not to the same degree as in the LAN case since the network is now the bottleneck and the client has more otherwise-idle CPU time with which to execute the external codec process.

Dial-up testing

In the dial-up network case, compression is crucial.  BZIP2-compressed XML generally gives the best performance in this environment since it generally gives the best compression.
