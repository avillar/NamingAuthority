i. Abstract 
This OGC InfraGML Encoding Standard presents the implementation-dependent, GML 
encoding of concepts supporting land and civil engineering infrastructure facilities 
specified in the OGC Land and Infrastructure Conceptual Model Standard (LandInfra), 
OGC 15-111r1.  Conceptual model subject areas include land features, facilities, projects, 
alignment, road, railway, survey (including equipment, observations, and survey results), 
land division, and condominiums. 

InfraGML is published as a multi-part standard. This Part 5 addresses the Railway 
Requirements Class from LandInfra. 

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

OGC document, LandInfra, InfraGML, infrastructure, civil, railway, cant, super 
elevation, transition curves. 

iii. Preface 
In order to achieve consensus on the concepts supporting land and civil engineering 
infrastructure facilities, a UML Conceptual Model, LandInfra, was approved as an OGC 
standard in August, 2016.  This model provides a unifying basis for encodings including 
but not limited to InfraGML, including similar work in buildingSMART International.  It 
can also provide a framework for discussing how other software standards relate to 
LandInfra. 

As an OGC standard, LandInfra follows the OGC modular specification standard, OGC 
08-131r3.  Because of the breadth of LandInfra, its subject areas are divided into separate 
Requirements Classes.  This InfraGML encoding similarly is divided into Requirements 
Classes which are then grouped into Parts.  A Part may address multiple LandInfra 
Requirements Classes but each Requirements Class is addressed in a single part.  Because 
Requirements Classes may depend on other Requirements Classes (see LandInfra Figure 
1, “Requirements Classes as UML Packages with their dependencies”), the reader of this 
InfraGML Part may need to conform to Requirements Classes in other Parts as well. 

Note that this InfraGML encoding standard is a target of LandInfra and therefore this 
standard conforms to the Requirements Classes in LandInfra.  On the other hand, an 
application claiming conformance to this InfraGML encoding standard must conform to 
the Requirements Classes contained in this InfraGML standard.   

There are several reasons for separating InfraGML into Parts.  Because they are likely to 
have separate authors, the rate at which each Part is completed may vary.  It would not be 
advisable to wait until all Parts complete before any can be released as separate OGC 
standards.  Multiple Parts will also allow each subject to have its own standards life 
cycle.  One Part can be updated independent of other Parts, subject to dependency

constraints.  And of course, it should be easier for the application software developer to 
only deal with Parts relevant to their application. 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be 
the subject of patent rights. The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held 
responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of 
any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be 
aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this 
document, and to provide supporting documentation.

1. Scope 

InfraGML is a GML encoding standard of the LandInfra Conceptual Model standard, 
OGC 15-111r1.  InfraGML is provided as a set of individual though inter-dependent 
Parts, each of which is a GML standard. 

The overall scope of this InfraGML Encoding Standard is infrastructure facilities and the 
land on which they are constructed.  Also included is the surveying necessary for the 
setting out and as-built recording of these facilities and land interests.  Primarily having a 
civil engineering point of view, InfraGML is relevant across all life cycle phases of a 
facility.  Subject areas include land features, facilities, projects, alignment, road, railway, 
survey (including equipment, observations, and survey results), land division, and 
condominiums. 

The scope of this Part 5 of InfraGML addresses the following subject area(s): railways.  
The InfraGML Railway Requirements Class is included.  It is optional in that an 
application can conform to InfraGML without supporting it, for example by only 
supporting the Survey Requirements Classes in Part 6.  However, to claim support for 
Railway, an application must also support the InfraGML Core and Facility Requirements 
Classes and may choose to support the Alignment Requirements Class.   

2. Conformance 

The InfraGML encoding standard defines requirements, grouped into Requirements 
Classes, for applications which read and write information about infrastructure facilities 
and the land on which they are constructed, including the surveying necessary for the 
setting out and as-built recording of these facilities and land interests.  

The OGC modular specification (OGC 08-131r3) defines “standardization target” as the 
entity to which requirements of a standard apply.  It further notes that the standardization 
target is the entity which may receive a certificate of conformance for a requirements 
class.  The standardization target type for this standard is therefore: 

• software applications which read/write data instances, i.e. XML documents that 
encode land, infrastructure facility, and survey data for exchange  

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in 
Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for 
testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC 
Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site1.

Copyright © 2017 Open Geospatial Consortium 

In order to conform to this OGC encoding standard, a standardization target shall choose 
to implement the core conformance class and any of the other conformance classes with 
their dependencies.  Conformance classes are based on Requirements Classes which are 
specified in this and possibly other Parts of the InfraGML standard.   

All requirements classes and conformance classes described in this document are owned 
by the standard(s) identified.  Note that Conformance Classes for this Part of InfraGML 
may require conformance with Conformance Classes from other Parts of InfraGML. 

3. References 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this 
text, constitute provisions of this Part of InfraGML. For dated references, subsequent 
amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated 
references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies.

4. Terms and Definitions 

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121r8], which is 
based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of 
International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 
to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard. 

The LandInfra standard contains a long list of terms and definitions relevant to the scope 
of InfraGML.  As these will not be repeated here, the reader is directed to Clause 4 of 
LandInfra.  Only terms not already appearing there are listed below.

5. Conventions 

5.1 Abbreviations 
In this document the following abbreviations and acronyms are used or introduced: 

GML  Geography Markup Language 

ISO   International Organization for Standardization 

OGC  Open Geospatial Consortium 

UML  Unified Modeling Language 

XML  eXtensible Markup Language 

5.2 UML Package and Class Diagrams 
The LandInfra standard contains UML diagrams for the concepts supported by 
InfraGML.  As these will not be repeated here, the reader is directed to Clause 7 of 
LandInfra.  UML will only appear in InfraGML in the rare cases where LandInfra is 
extended by InfraGML. 

5.3 Requirements 
When referred to in a Requirement or Requirements Class, the boxes contained in the 
LandInfra UML figures may all be called “Classes” even if they are data types, 
enumerations, code lists, unions etc.  In most cases, these will be encoded as XML 
elements in InfraGML. 

When an InfraGML Requirement states that “A conforming application shall support the 
[Requirements Class] XML elements listed in Table <n> in accordance with the GML 
XSD in this standard.”, the XSD was developed to support the UML for the 
corresponding LandInfra Requirements Class as follows: 

a) all classes shown as blue boxes for the corresponding LandInfra Requirements 
Class UML diagrams; 

b) all attributes, attribute cardinalities, and attribute data types of these classes 
(usually shown in subsequent diagrams); 

c) all associations, navigation, roles, and role cardinalities connected to the blue 
classes; 

d) all classes shown as beige boxes (another Requirements Class) in the diagrams 
connected to the blue box classes by association or used as attribute data types; 
and 

e) all classes shown as pink boxes (another Standard) in the figure connected to the 
blue box classes by association or used as attribute data types.

Copyright © 2017 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Note that, in rare cases, the OGC 15-111r1 UML may be altered.  In such cases, the 
alterations are declared in the first subclause of each Requirements Class, entitled 
“Implementation decisions regarding OGC 15-111r1 UML”.  Logical Model UML 
diagrams may be included if the implementation constraints of GML (or XML) dictate 
that the Conceptual Model cannot be implemented directly as shown in OGC 15-111r1. 

In most cases, the InfraGML XML derived from the LandInfra UML follows the rules in 
OGC 07-036, GML, Annex E, UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules. 

The only normative version of the GML XSD (XML schema definition) for all Parts of 
the InfraGML Encoding Standard is available from the official OGC XML schema 
repository at http://schemas.opengis.net.  Any occurrences of all or part of this XSD 
contained within this document are to be considered to be informative only. 

The URI base for the LandInfra Conceptual Model standard is 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/landinfra/1.0. All URIs of Requirements Classes, 
Requirements, and Conformance Classes contained in that standard are relative to this 
base.

6. InfraGML Parts 

The InfraGML encoding standard has been divided into Parts.  These Parts enable the 
grouping of LandInfra subject areas (Requirements Classes) into individual OGC 
encoding standards.  All of these InfraGML encoding standards have a similar name: 
“OGC 16-10n, OGC® InfraGML 1.0: Part n - <part name> Encoding Standard”, where 
Part numbers and names are as follows: 

n	 <part	name>	
0	 LandInfra	Core	
1	 LandInfra	LandFeatures	
2	 LandInfra	Facilities	and	Projects	
3	 LandInfra	Alignments	
4	 LandInfra	Roads	
5	 LandInfra	Railways	
6	 LandInfra	Survey	
7	 LandInfra	LandDivision	

 

Some InfraGML Parts depend upon other parts:

Figure 1.  InfraGML Part Dependencies 

The boxes above represent InfraGML Parts.  Arrows show Part dependencies.  

The Part dependencies derive from the dependencies of the InfraGML Requirements 
Classes contained in these Parts.  The reader should rely more on the InfraGML 
Requirements Class dependencies and only use the Part dependencies as a guide for 
knowing which InfraGML Part standards to consider. 

InfraGML Parts include the following LandInfra 1.0 Requirements Classes (UML 
Packages):

7. Requirements Classes for this Part 

7.1 Structural Overview of Requirements Classes 
The Requirements Classes for this Part of the InfraGML encoding standard (shown in 
blue in Figure 3 below) are defined in this Clause 7.  Requirements Classes from other 
Parts upon which this Part’s Requirements Classes are dependent (shown in beige in 
Figure 3 below) are listed here but defined in the documentation of their respective Parts.  
External OGC and ISO standards on which Requirements Classes in this Standard depend 
(shown in pink in Figure 3 below) are also listed.  Below is a brief summary of the 
function of each of these Requirements Classes.

Figure 3.  Requirements Classes for this Part and its Dependencies 

7.1.1 Requirement Classes Defined in This Part 
 

Railway 

The Railway Requirements Class supports those use cases where a designer wishes to 
exchange the output of the design with someone who is likely to use if for purposes other 
than further design.  On the other hand, a possible future RailwayDesign Requirements 
Class could support the more complex designer to designer information interchange, such 
as would exist when a designer other than the original designer takes over the design 
process to complete the design.  Alternatively, this may be left to IFCs.   

Consequently, the Railway Requirements Class covers design output such as 
RailwayElements, track geometry including chainage discontinuities and superelevation 
(cant). 

7.1.2 Dependent Requirement Classes Defined in Other Parts 
The Requirements Classes defined in this Part are dependent on the following 
Requirements Classes from other Parts.

Copyright © 2017 Open Geospatial Consortium 

LandInfra is the core Requirements Class and is the only mandatory Requirements Class.  
This class contains information about the Land and Infrastructure dataset that can contain 
information about facilities, land features, land division, documents, survey marks, 
surveys, sets, and feature associations.  LandInfra also contains the definition of types 
common across other Requirements Classes, such as the Status CodeList.  

Part 2.  LandInfra Facility 

Facilities include collections of buildings and civil engineering works and their 
associated siteworks.  The Facilities Requirements Class includes the breakdown of 
facilities into discipline specific facility parts and introduces the notion of elements which 
make up these parts.  The Facilities Requirements Class only provides general support for 
facilities themselves, allowing subsequent Requirements Classes to focus on specific 
types of the parts that make up facilities, such as road and railway.  This Requirements 
Class is optional in order to allow for the condition where all of the LandInfra dataset 
information is not facility related, such as one containing only survey or land division 
information. 

7.1.3 Other Standards upon which the Requirement Classes of this Part Depend  
For external OGC and ISO standards on which Requirements Classes in this Standard 
depend, a brief summary of the function of each of these Standards is described below.  

GML 3.2 

OGC 07-036, OpenGIS® Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard, v3.2 
provides most of the geometry types (e.g., Point, LineString, Polygon) used for spatial 
representations in this Standard.  Defines Coordinate Reference Systems.  Supports the 
General Feature Model upon which this Standard is based. 

GML 3.3  

OGC 10-129r1, OGC® Geography Markup Language (GML) — Extended schemas and 
encoding rules, v3.3 defines the linear referencing concepts (e.g., linear element, distance 
along, Linear Referencing Methods) used for linearly referenced locations in this 
Standard.

Copyright © 2017 Open Geospatial Consortium 

7.2.1 Implementation decisions regarding OGC 15-111r1 UML  
The following implementation decisions have been made regarding the OGC 15-111r1 
Railway Requirements Class UML: 

1. The explicit association between the Railway.alignment from the Railway class to the 
Alignment class in the conceptual model was implemented by instead re-using the 
Feature.spatialRepresentation element. Since the complexType AlignmentCurve is in the 
gml:AbstractCurve substitutionGroup it may optionally be used as the 
spatialRepresentation for a Railway element if the application supports the Alignment 
Requirements Class from LandInfra Part 3 (where AlignmentCurve is defined).   

2.  Because the Feature.FeatureID attribute was dropped from Core (see Part 0), 
Railway.railwayID has been added.  Because Element was removed from Part 2 Facilities 
and Projects, Railway.railwayElementID has been added.  IDs have also been added for 
RailwayElementSet. 

7.2.2 Specific Requirements for this Requirements Class 
 

Requirement /req/railway/elements  

A conforming application shall support the Railway XML elements listed 
in Table 1 in accordance with the GML XSD specified in 
http://schemas.opengis.net/infragml/part5/1.0/railway.xsd. 

 

An application conforming to this standard shall support the Railway XML elements 
listed below in Table 1 in accordance with the GML XSD specified in 
http://schemas.opengis.net/infragml/part5/1.0/railway.xsd. Railway XML element names 
are shown with a XML namespace prefix of “lifrw”.  Corresponding LandInfra UML 
classes are shown with their LandInfra Requirements Class prefix of “Railway”.   

 

InfraGML	XML	element	 LandInfra	UML	Class	

lifrw:CantEvent	 Railway::CantEvent	

lifrw:CantSpecification	 Railway::	CantSpecification	

lifrw:Railway	 Railway::Railway	

lifrw:RailwayElement	 Railway::RailwayElement	

lifrw:RailwayElementSet	 Railway::	RailwayElementSet	
Table 1.  InfraGML Railway XML elements with corresponding LandInfra UML classes 

A Railway FacilityPart is represented as RailwayElements. These can be specified 
relative to some linear element, in accordance with OGC Abstract Specification Topic 19, 



17 
Copyright © 2017 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Linear Referencing.  If the application supports the InfraGML Alignment Requirements 
Class, then an Alignment can serve as the linearly locating linear element. 

Requirement /req/road/alignment 

If an application allows the linear element used for locating 
RailwayElements to be an Alignment, or if it allows the 
spatialRepresentation geometry to be of type AlignmentCurve, then that 
application shall support the Alignment Requirements Class. 

 

7.2.3 Railway with RailwayElement (switch) example 
The RailwayElement example follows the OGC 15-111r1, Clause 7.7.3, [LandInfra] 
RailwayElement. The switch is described as a Railway FacilityPart which is a collection 
of RailwayElements, see Annex Error! Reference source not found.. 

 

7.2.4 Railway with Cant example 
The cant of a railway track (also referred to as superelevation) is the difference in 
elevation (height) between the two rails. This is normally done where the railway is 
curved; raising the outer rail providing a banked turn. The superelevation development 
length is the distance over which superelevation is developed from the normal cross-fall 
to full superelevation.  

CantEvent marks a location along the linear element where an applied cant value is 
specified.  If two succeeding CantEvents have the same applied cant value, then that 
value applies to the entire linear element segment between those two events.  If two 
succeeding CantEvents have different applied cant values, then the cant value is assumed 
to vary linearly between the two events. CantSpecification is a collection of CantEvents 
along a single linear element for a single Railway, see Annex B. 1.   

8. Media Types for any data encoding(s) 

Data for all Parts of the InfraGML encoding standard is encoded in GML-conformant 
XML documents. The standard MIME-type and sub-type for GML data should be used to 
indicate the encoding in internet exchange, as specified in MIME Media Types for GML, 
namely ‘application/gml+xml’.
