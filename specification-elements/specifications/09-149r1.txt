Introduction 

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic retrieval of geospatial data as 
"coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phe-
nomena. 

This document specifies an extension to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0 core to 
allow for client/server communication using SOAP with XML encoding.  

 



OGC 09-149r1 
 

OGC® Web Coverage Service 2.0 Interface Standard - 
XML/SOAP Protocol Binding Extension 

1 Scope  

This document specifies how Web Coverage Service (WCS) clients and servers can commu-
nicate over the Internet using SOAP with XML encoding. 

2 Conformance 

Standardization target are WCS 2.0 implementations (currently: servers).  

This document establishes a single requirements class, soap, of URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_soap/1.0/req/soap with a single pertain-
ing conformance class, soap, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-
binding_soap/1.0/conf /soap. Requirements and conformance test URIs defined in this docu-
ment are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_soap/1.0/. 

Annex A lists the conformance tests which shall be exercised on any software artefact claim-
ing to implement an OGC WCS using this extension.  

3 Normative references 

This OGC WCS 2.0 SOAP Protocol Binding Extension specification consists of the present 
document and an XML Schema. The complete specification is identified by OGC URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_soap/1.0, the document has OGC URI 
http://www.opengis.net/doc/ISx/WCS_protocol-binding_soap/1.0.  

The complete specification is available for download from 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs; additionally, the XML Schema is posted on-
line at http://schemas.opengis.net/wcs/ 2.0 as part of the OGC schema repository. In the event 
of a discrepancy between bundled and schema repository versions of the XML Schema files, 
the schema repository shall be considered authoritative. 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this text, 
constitute provisions of this specification. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, 
or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated references, the latest edi-
tion of the normative document referred to applies.

4 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in the above references 
apply. 

5 Conventions 

5.1 UML notation 

All the diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) static structure diagram, as described in Subclause 5.2 of OGC Web Ser-
vice Common [OGC 06-121r9]. 

5.2 Data dictionary tables 

The UML model data dictionary is specified herein in a series of tables. The contents of the 
columns in these tables are described in Subclause 5.5 of [OGC 06-121r9]. The contents of 
these data dictionary tables are normative, including any table footnotes. 

6 SOAP with XML 

Requirement 1 /req/soap/extension-identifier: 
A WCS service implementing this extension shall include the following URI in the Profile 
element of the ServiceIdentification in a GetCapabilities response: 
  http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_soap/1.0 

Requirement 2 /req/soap/wcsServiceMetadata: 
For those WCSServiceMetadata elements inherited from OWSServiceMetadata, WCS 
servers shall specify the HTTP POST request encodings accepted by including an 
ows:Constraint element, with “PostEncoding” as the value of the name attribute and 
with a value of “SOAP” to indicate that SOAP encoding is allowed. 

Requirement 3 /req/soap/soap-pattern: 
WCS servers and clients implementing this protocol shall adhere to SOAP 1.2 for all WCS 
operation requests and responses. The SOAP Request-Response message exchange pattern 
shall be used with the HTTP POST binding. 

Requirement 4 /req/soap/soap-envelope-body: 
Each XML-encoded operation request and response shall consist of one SOAP Envelope 
containing exactly one Body. In a request, each Body shall contain exactly one WCS request. 

Requirement 5 /req/soap/soap-with-attachments: 
A GetCoverage SOAP response shall be encoded as “SOAP with Attachments” as defined in 
[W3C Note 11], but using SOAP 1.2 rather than SOAP 1.1. 

Requirement 6 /req/soap/single-body-element: 
In a GetCoverage response, the SOAP Envelope shall contain one Body element which con-
tains the Coverage as its single element.

OGC 09-149r1 
 

Requirement 7 /req/soap/soap-fault: 
When an error is detected while processing an operation request encoded in a SOAP envel-
ope, the WCS server shall generate a SOAP response message where the content of the Body 
element is a Fault element containing an ows:ExceptionReport element [OGC 06-
121r9], with the soap:Value element element having the fixed string “soap:server” and the 
soap:Text having the fixed string “Server exception was encountered.”  

Note This fixed string is used since the details of the exception shall be specified in the Detail ele-
ment using an ows:ExceptionReport element as specified in OWS Common [OGC 06-121r9]. 

To allow WCS extensions to add further parameters the XML Schema wcs:Request-
BaseType contains an optional element <extension> with unbounded cardinality. This 
way, extensions can add their individual request parameters without (syntactic) interference. 

7 WSDL 

WCS SOAP bindings are described in file wcs-soap-binding.wsdl provided in the 
wsdl/ subdirectory of the WCS XML schema tree.  

Requirement 8 /req/soap/wsdl: 
Publication of a WCS SOAP service endpoint shall use the binding as defined in file 
wsdl/wcs-soap-binding.wsdl of the WCS XML package. 

NOTE A sample service description relying on this binding is provided in file example-soap-
endpoint.wsdl. 

8 Exceptions 

Requirement 9 /req/soap/exceptions: 
When a WCS server encounters an error described in column “meaning of exception code” in 
Table 1 then it shall return the corresponding exception report message with the contents of 
the locator parameter value as specified in the right column of  Table 1.

sage where the content of the Body element is a Fault element containing 
an ows:ExceptionReport element [OGC 06-121r9], with the 
soap:Value element element having the fixed string “soap:server” and 
the soap:Text having the fixed string “Server exception was encoun-
tered.” 

Test method: For each request type, send an erroneous request. Check SOAP response 
document.

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/soap/wsdl: 
Publication of a WCS SOAP service endpoint shall use the binding as de-
fined in file wsdl/wcs-soap-binding.wsdl of the WCS XML pack-
age. 

Test method: For the service under test, retrieve the WSDL description and issue requests 
which make use of this service definition. Check that the service can be 
addressed and that queries can be retrieved properly. 

A.1.9 Exceptions 

Test id: /conf/soap/exceptions 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/soap/exceptions: 
When a WCS server encounters an error described in column “meaning of 
exception code” in Table 1 then it shall return the corresponding exception 
report message with the contents of the locator parameter value as speci-
fied in the right column of  Table 1. 

Test method: Send requests of all types supported to the server under test. Each request 
shall include all (mandatory and) optional parameters and shall be valid 
except for one parameter which shall contain an encoding error described in 
the exception specification. Test passes if exception is reported according to 
requirement.
