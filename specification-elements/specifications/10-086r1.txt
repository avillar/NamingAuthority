 OWS-7 - Authoritative Data Source Directory Engineering 

Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

The Authoritative Data Source Directory (ADSD) is a resource capable of organizing and 

discovering a wide variety of types of data such as web sites, books, pictures/images, et al. as 

well as available web services. The directory will have the ability to identify and query for data 

sources based on socio-cultural themes, geographic area (either coordinates or geographic name), 

temporal relevance, and data quality (e.g. precision, fitness for use).  

 

The ADSD concept will be implemented as an OGC catalog service supporting all the interfaces 

of CSW 2.0.2. ADSD extends CSW, adding the following features:  

 Enforces certain metadata requirements on data entries, such as inclusion of geography, time, 
data quality, authoritativeness, usefulness rating, provenance, and keywords.  

 Provides an OpenSearch query interface with support for the Suggestions extension.  

 Catalogs OWS Context (OWC) documents  

 Provides access to taxonomic lists (such as socio-cultural themes) via the OpenSearch 
interface with support for the Suggestions extension.

1.4 Future work 

Improvements in this document are desirable to address open issues; to correct errors or enhance 

existing document content. 

The goal of this testbed was to provide for standards in finding, storing, and sharing authoritative 

data. Through the work of the testbed these techniques were demonstrated and key problem areas 

identified. Future work includes mechanisms for sharing authoritative metrics across servers in 

order to provide for consistent scoring and ranking. 

1.5 Forward 

The purpose of this engineering report (ER) is to document the design concepts, equivalent 

standards, and implementation guidelines as pursued in the OWS-7 Testbed. It encompasses a 

variety of viewpoints, each of which explains the considerations and requirements based on the 

viewpoint.  

The Enterprise Viewpoint provides the context of the use of an ADSD within operational 

processes and goals of an organization and mission. The Computational Viewpoint concerns the 

functional decomposition of the system into a set of distinct components that interact at 

interfaces. The Information Viewpoint documents the information models and encodings of the 

content and services that were outlined in the Computational Viewpoint. Lastly, the Engineering 

Viewpoint describes the specific components linked by a communications network and the 

implementable interactions of distinct computational objects. A summary of issues identified and 

further work outlines areas of future research and exploration.

3.2 OpenSearch 

OpenSearch, Ref[13], is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results. 

Specifically provides a templated interface to allow search services to document query 

parameters in a simple search request. It is most prominently used in web browsers to enable the 

quick search feature for querying popular search engines and websites. 

3.3 Ranking 

A quantitive measure of the ‗authoritiveness‘ of a dataset based on a ranking scheme relevant to 

a given user or community. Includes a provinence (sponsor) for the ranking scheme (e.g. NGA). 

3.4 Tagging 

(from Wikipedia) A non-hierarchical keyword or term assigned to a piece of information (such 

as an Internet bookmark, digital image, or computer file). This kind of metadata  helps describe 

an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching. Tags are generally chosen 

informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system. 

Tagging was popularized by websites associated with Web 2.0 and is an important feature of 

many Web 2.0 services.

5 Enterprise Viewpoint 

The context for feature and decision fusion can be one of critical urgency. Lives, resources, 

diplomatic efforts, and civil order may depend on the outcomes of these fusion processes. 

Complicating the analytical processing is the need for coherent and consistent communications 

and data throughout a hierarchical chain of command. This is true in both defense and civil 

applications. The regional and national organizations involved could be emergency response 

agencies, centers for disease control, theater and national defense commands, and so on. 

A key part of supporting feature and decision fusion are catalog, or registry services, providing 

sophisticated capabilities to discover, organize and access relevant data sources. One currently 

popular term for this kind of information service is an Authoritative Data Source. Ponzio defines 

the motivation for an ADS as follows: 

“Throughout the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense (DoD), there is a 

pervasive need to have current, reliable, and trusted data from what are termed Authoritative 

Data Sources (ADSs). This requirement has grown increasingly important as the military 

transforms. The transformation requires individual organizations, each using an array of 

independently developed stovepipe systems, to function on the battlefield with other weapons 

systems, services, and friendly nations, sharing communications networks and data. To ensure 

the accuracy of the data being provided by ADSs, new methodologies and metrics must be 

initiated.” 

“Authoritative Data Source (ADS) Framework and ADS Maturity Model,” 

 Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Information Quality (ICIQ-04) 

Frank J. Ponzio, Jr., 2004 

 

Authoritative data sources, however, are rarely comprehensive enough to fulfill all the needs of 

analysts. They still need to look beyond the confines of ―official‖ or enterprise data sets, 

reaching out into other structured data repositories and also leveraging the vast, unstructured 

open source content available on the Internet.  

In the ADSD sub-thread of the OWS-7 Feature and Decision Fusion thread, participants 

analyzed relevant existing technologies from within the OGC standards baseline as well as the 

general information technology space. The goal was not only to provide services for geospatial 

data, but also to integrate geospatial data discovery methods with those from non-geospatial 

domains such as web sites, books, pictures/images, etc. Due to the emphasis on Humanitarian 

Assistance and Disaster Relief operations undertaken by military organizations, particular 

attention was paid to discovering, organizing, and categorizing information that falls into the 

discipline of Human Terrain Analysis (see Table 1 and Table 5). 

Detailed search requires metadata. Even seemingly unstructured searches use metadata, they just 

use custom metadata schemes that aren‘t communicated to users. Web search engines, for 

example, closely guard the secret of what metadata is considered important because they 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 7 

consider that a key facet of their market advantage. The change from traditional geospatial and 

information sharing is that web sites and ―open source‖ data often don‘t include highly detailed 

metadata. Relying on detailed metadata, as is used in previous OGC efforts is not always 

possible. Therefore it was necessary to consider more generalized mechanisms for searching and 

federating data.  

The ADSD is a resource capable of organizing and discovering a wide variety of types of 

structured and unstructured data and services. It has the ability to identify and query for data 

sources based on socio-cultural themes, geographic area (either coordinates or geographic name), 

temporal relevance, and data quality (fitness for use).  

For this purpose, OpenSearch was considered as an attractive solution that is commonly used 

amongst web services and catalogs that include both detailed metadata records as well as 

publicly available, open-sourced data. OpenSearch provides mechanisms for defining loosely 

coupled services. In order to support the various facets the Geo, Time, Suggestions and Rankings 

extensions are included. 

The ADSD concept was implemented as an OGC catalog supporting a custom OpenSearch 

interface, which is comprised of the basic OpenSearch API plus a number of extensions which 

provide the following functionality:  

 Enforcing certain metadata requirements on data entries, such as inclusion of geography, 
time, data quality, authoritativeness, usefulness rating, provenance, and keywords. 

 Providing ―type-ahead‖ content completion hints to the user via the OpenSearch Suggestions 
extension.  

 Cataloging of OGC Web Services Context (OWC) documents. 

 Providing access to taxonomic lists (such as socio-cultural themes). 

Information to be discovered falls into a number of categories spanning both geospatial and non-

geospatial as well as from highly-structured to unstructured narratives or media as described 

below in Table 1.

Table 1: Types of Information shared through an ADSD 

 
The goal of the ADSD is to provide the ability to discover, share, publish, and consume this 

array of data in such a way as to include measures of quality and authority, both explicit and 

implicit. The ADSD is not a single service or software component. It is the synergistic 

combination of search interfaces, information models for describing content, and user-interface 

design.  

5.1 Use Cases 

The ADSD provides two key roles. Firstly it allows information discovery and then supports 

information publication. These two roles are outlined in the various use cases for ADSD (1-7) 

that are summarized below.  

 

Figure 1: Overall Use Cases defined for ADSD 

 

The detail of these use cases is given in the sections below. 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 9 

5.1.1 Use Case: ADSD Discovery  (FDF-ADSD-1)  

Description: Describes how a user discovers an ADSD compliant catalog. 

Goal: Obtain access to a "catalog" resource  

Actors (Initiators):  Human User, Email, Web search, etc.  

Actors (Receivers): Human User  

Pre-Conditions: None  

Post-Conditions: Access to ADSD   

System Components:  

 ADSD service 

 "Decision Fusion" client application 

Alternate Courses of Action:  

 User gets a URL to the ADSD offline (e.g. via email, etc.) 

 ADSD access built into User's "Decision Fusion" client application 

5.1.2 Use Case: ADSD Search  (FDF-ADSD-2)  

Description: Describes how a user browses metadata by searching on keywords, geography, and 

time (traditional OGC CSW search activity).  

Goal: Find relevant data sources  

Actors (Initiators): Human User Actors (Receivers): Human User  

Pre-Conditions: FDF-ADSD-1  

Post-Conditions: Client seeded with search results  

System Components: 

 ADSD service 

 ADSD client (or integrated "Decision Fusion" client) 

Basic Course of Action:  

1. User enters search parameters in a GUI  

 keywords (tags) 

 area of interest (geographic bounding box) 

 temporal range (min date / max date) 
2. GUI client submits the user‘s search request to ADSD 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 10 

3. ADSD service discovers datasets from one or more registries (Controlled Artifacts) and 
more general URLs and these reference objects of various mime types. 

4. ADSD service responds with results 
5. The results include ordered listings of results based on measures of authority as well as 

capabilities for a client or user to discover related data sources. 

5.1.3 Use Case: ADSD Directed Navigation (FDF-ADSD-3) 

Description: Describes how a user browses metadata using pre-defined thematic relationships  

Goal: Find relevant data sources  

Actors (Initiators): Human User Actors (Receivers): Human User  

Pre-Conditions:  FDF-ADSD-1  

Post-Conditions: Client seeded with search results  

System Components: 

 ADSD service 

 ADSD client (or integrated "Decision Fusion" client) 

 Taxonomy of data themes (provided via an ADSD service operation?)  

Basic Course of Action:  

 User requests theme list from ADSD service  

 ADSD client sends request for themes 

 ADSD service responds with themes 

 ADSD client uses the response to construct a GUI that allows the user to do any of the 
following: 

o view all data sets for a particular theme 
o restrict the result set (drill-down) by selecting any of the following:  

 a sub-theme 
 an authoritativeness ranking 
 a specific publisher 
 a "community-sourced" usefulness ranking 

o change the result set by selecting a related theme 

5.1.4  Use Case: ADSD Hybrid Discovery (FDF-ADSD-4) 

Description: Describes how a user combines traditional search with directed navigation  

Goal: Find relevant data sources  

Actors (Initiators): Human User Actors (Receivers): Human User  

Pre-Conditions:  FDF-ADSD-1, FDF-ADSD-2, FDF-ADSD-3  



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 11 

Post-Conditions: Client seeded with search results  

System Components: 

 ADSD service 

 ADSD client (or integrated "Decision Fusion" client) 

 Taxonomy of data themes 

Basic Course of Action:  

 User enters search parameters in a GUI as in FDF-ADSD-2. However, as the user types each 
character, the ADSD client queries the ADSD service for matching themes and/or tags using 

OpenSearch Suggestions, and presents the user with a search completion list. This list 

changes with each character the user types. 

 Alternatively, or in addition, the user may start with a directed navigation as in FDF-ADSD-
3. In this case, the GUI should allow keyword/tag/geography/time search to be combined 

with the directed navigation at any point in the user's search activity. 

5.1.5 Use Case: Persist Data (FDF-ADSD-5) 

Description: User has one or more data sets in their workspace and now wants to save/persist 

this information. 

Goal: The state of a geospatial-centric work session is described in an OWS Context document 

Actors (Initiators): Human User Actors (Receivers): Human User 

Pre-Conditions:  TBD 

Post-Conditions: TBD 

System Components:  

• ADSD client (Integrated Client) 

• OWS Context document (OWC) 

Basic Course of Action:  

• Not included in OWS-7

5.1.9 Use Case: Exploit Data (FDF-ADSD-8) 

Success Scenario:  

User takes search response and other data that didn't come through the search and produces a 

product related to this and persist it.  

 The client evaluates the results are stored in an OGC Context ready for evaluation.  

 Results are stored as a context document.  

 The client reads the context document and evaluates the relevance of each one (probably 
without loading them all) in an evaluation process (e.g. user can look at the thumbnails).  

 The client loads the data related to the context and exploits it.  

New services can be published and become available in OpenSearch with 

geo/temporal/tagging/authority and sort by authority  

The remainder of this report outlines the design and implementation of the components of an 

ADSD with close attention paid to the treatment of user-generated content. The information 

models used are described in the Information Viewpoint section of this document. The 

search/discovery interfaces are described in the Computational Viewpoint section. And their 

interactions are described in the Engineering Viewpoint.

6 Computational Viewpoint 

6.1 Overview 

The Computational Viewpoint is concerned with the functional decomposition of the system into 

a set of distinct components that interact at interfaces. For OGC, such components are generally 

realized as web services. With regards to the ADSD this section will focus on the overall use 

cases of a client discovering, searching, and parsing the results to a service that contains a list of 

authoritative documents or data sources. The processes of discovering a search interface, parsing 

the interface and performing a query, parsing the response and following links to data or service 

endpoints is discussed. In addition, the concept of publishing search results to a directory is 

presented. 

 

For details on the encodings, models, and implementations of these computational viewpoints, 

see the corresponding information and engineering viewpoints. 

The typical use case for this is shown in the figure below. 

   

 

Figure 2: ADSD Interactions for Search 

 

A User performs a query to a Client application or interface by specifying any of the following 

criteria: search term, categories, attribute ranges, geographic bounds, or authoritativeness. 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 15 

Additional criteria could be supported by a client or subsequent services as provided but are 

beyond the scope of OWS-7. 

The Client application formulates this combined query and requests processing from one or more 

ADSD servers. The query is formed as specified by the ADSD server following the proposed 

template interface described in the Information and Engineering viewpoints. 

The Servers respond with a list of data sources that meet the specified Query criteria along with 

additional information on metrics of authoritativeness, quality, reliability, relevance and also 

additional parameters as supported by the server. 

Additional Client query requests can be made to non-authoritative data source directories as 

might be available from publicly available web sites or search engines. These results are also 

formulated and returned with available result measurement criteria. 

The Client application will aggregate these multiple results from the ADSD Servers and 

additional network services into an interface or set that is then viewable the User.  

Details on the processes of internal search and sorting of Servers, or the aggregation of results in 

the Client are beyond the scope of OWS-7. 

6.2 Interfaces 

The current OGC Catalogue query interface is predicated on forming fairly formal queries using 

a specialist interface (reverse polish notation, and XML heavy syntax). The ADSD on the other 

hand needs a query interface that is both less heavily structured and is more accessible to other 

clients.  

A more accessible and ―open‖ search interface is considered an additional requirement rather 

than a replacement option. The interface chosen to experiment with this is the OpenSearch model 

that will be described in further detail in the Information and Engineering Viewpoints. 

To meet the overall requirements, the ADSD has to have a permissive search interface, offering 

the ability to discover a range of content as opposed to very formalized content (i.e. it should not 

preclude delivery of both well defined, exploitable content and loose content only qualified by 

MIME-type).  In addition it should support the publication of content, so that new content can be 

registered. 

6.2.1 Query (OpenSearch ADSD) 

Query of the ADSD is performed using OpenSearch. OpenSearch works by defining the 

service‘s query API through a short XML document called an OpenSearch description 

document.  

Search clients can use OpenSearch description documents to learn about the public interface of a 

search engine. These description documents contain parameterized URL templates that indicate 

how the search client should make search requests. Search engines can use the OpenSearch 

response elements to add search metadata to results in a variety of content formats.

Example of a simple OpenSearch description document: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 

 <OpenSearchDescription xmlns="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/"> 

   <ShortName>Web Search</ShortName> 

   <Description>Use Example.com to search the Web.</Description> 

   <Tags>example web</Tags> 

   <Contact>admin@example.com</Contact> 

   <Url type="application/rss+xml"  

        template="http://example.com/?q={searchTerms}&amp;pw={startPage?}&amp;format=rss"/> 

 </OpenSearchDescription> 

 

6.2.2 Publish (CSW) 

Publication and/or harvesting of resources was not deemed a requirement for the OWS-6 work 

on ADSDs. However, some participants used the CSW 2.0.2 publishing mechanism. 

Publishing into a CSW 2.0.2 catalog can be done using two operations. These include the 

‗Transaction‘ operation and the ‗Harvest‘ operation. The ‗Transaction‘ operation is made up of 

three actions including ‗Insert‘, ‗Update‘, and ‗Delete‘ which are used to create, modify and 

delete catalog records respectively.  

The ‗Insert‘ action acts as a container for the one of more records that are to be inserted into the 

catalog.  

The ‗Update‘ action contains one or more records with modified data that will be changed in the 

catalog. 

The ‗Delete‘ action identifies a set records that will be removed from the catalog.  

The ‗Harvest‘ operation involves the resolving a URI pointing to a metadata resource, parsing it, 

and finally creating or modifying metadata records in the catalog to register the resource.  

 

6.3 Context Document Publishing 

In addition to performing queries and aggregating and parsing results there is the need to publish 

context documents or search results from queries to additional ADSD servers. A context 

document contains a list of data services and sources with associated metadata. It should be 

possible to publish a Context Document to an ADSD as a means to register the data sources as 

well as provide additional metadata on quality based on annotations and usage of the source 

within the context document. 

In OWS-7, Context Document publishing was done in an ad hoc, non-standardized way. Once 

the Context Document encoding format reaches OGC Standard status, the publishing of these 

documents in CSW catalogs should be addressed. However, CSW publication and/or harvesting 

is not a requirement for an ADSD. Since Context Documents are Atom resources, they can be 

easily discovered and indexed by mainstream search engines as long as they are made accessible 

on the Web.

6.4 Creating and Querying Annotations 

As part of the Authoritative Data Source Directory, it is beneficial to provide mechanisms to 

allow client users to update and annotate data sources with quantitative and qualitative 

evaluations of authority and fitness for use.  

 

Figure 3: Creating and Querying Annotations of an ADSD 

 

The content of annotations is outside the scope of OWS-7, but could consist of a free text note, 

or a type of rating such as accuracy, reliability, completeness, and relevance. These annotations 

would be stored in the ADSD and reference the specified data source. Subsequent calculations of 

authority and rank would incorporate these annotations based on internal calculations and 

provide ordered results based on these internal metrics and user requested filtering and sort 

orders. 

In addition, a client consumer could optionally request the specific annotations. Based on 

specific ADSD restrictions of access to annotations and attributions, these annotations would be 

provided to clients as lists of elements. 

In this way, organizations providing ADSD software can provide customers with a standard 

search interface—ADSD OpenSearch—while still providing competitive differentiation through 

the ―smarts‖ of their internal ranking and rating systems.

7 Information Viewpoint 

7.1 Overview 

The Information Viewpoint considers the information models and encodings that will make up the 

content of the services and exchanges discussed in the Computational Viewpoint. With regards to the 

ADSD this includes the Query encoding in either OpenSearch for endpoint discovery and interface 

templating, or Catalog Services for the Web (CSW).  In addition, this section describes the search 

response as either a general Atom response, Ref[3], or as a more specific OWS Context document.  

As part of the OWS-7 FDF thread, extensions are suggested to Atom and OWS Context that provide for 

encoding Thematic Categories as well as measures of authoritativeness of documents and data. As an 

alternative encoding, JSON could be used following the Atom markup.  

Finally, this section includes a crosswalk between the generalized Atom response and the Department of 

Defense Metadata Standard (DDMS), see Ref [1], as well as Dublin Core (DC), Ref[2], Ref[5]. 
 

7.2 Authority and Ranking  

Authority and ranking covers a range of types, ranging from identification of reliability of an item, 

through to type classification (e.g. relevance to a given field) and through to open community-based 

questionnaire ranking, e.g. ‗Rate how useful this dataset was to you‘. The goal is to some degree to 

generate rankings automatically. A typical ranking might be based on how prevalent the given source is 

in all context documents. The concept being that if it is heavily used it has a high ranking. Ranking is 

expressed as: 

 Category of the ranking 

 Ranking classifications 

 Ranking provenance 

7.3 Categories, Code Lists, Tags and Controlled Vocabularies 

An Authoritative Data Source Directory sorts datasets into one or more thematic categories. Categories 

can be prescribed, such as the NGA Human Terrain Entity Catalog Definition, or they can be organic 

and folksonomic in nature, and change as users create and apply new categories to the catalog. 

 

The OWS-7 recommends utilizing the Atom <category /> tag to encode the thematic organization of 

datasets or features. The semantics of Atom already suggest that <category /> is a tag, or thematic 

organization, of the Atom entry. By use of the scheme attribute, the ADSD may specify a controlled 

vocabulary for the category, and a client can investigate the category’s scheme, finding definitions, 

similar terms, or cross-walk through parent and sibling categories. 

 

To request a code list, an HTTP GET is made to the data sources code list. This can vary between 

services depending on the types of categories or code lists that are employed. The typical response will 

be an Atom formatted XML document with an <entry /> for each category consisting of the following 

additional elements: 

 

 title – the category name 

 link@rel=self – the HTTP URI that links to the categories description 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 19 

 link@rel=alternate – an HTTP URI that links to alternative format description of the category 

 additional Atom elements as appropriate (updated, summary, et al.) 
 

In addition, a category can itself belong to other categories. This provides for hierarchical and nested 

sets of categories. An example request may look like: 

 

GET http://example.org/codelists/ows7DataSources 

And the response would be:

7.3.1 Categories in OpenSearch 

In addition to utilizing the existing Atom category element, it is recommended that an equivalent 

OpenSearch description is added that allows for querying a catalog and specifying category or 

categories, and also for requesting the code list, or directory of categories. 

OpenSearch provides for a simplified, discoverable templated query description to a search service that 

can implement any number of query specifications. By using a combination of OpenSearch and relevant 

extensions, ADSD‘s can be easily discovered and searched from a broad range of clients, as well as 

discover and consume data from upstream services. OpenSearch is described in depth on its web site 

http://opensearch.org. 

Specifically, the Authoritative Data Source Directory needs to have the capability to convey the 

'authoritativeness', or relative quality and utility, of data cataloged and hosted in the directory. This draft 

specification outlines an Atom encoding of a directory search including specifying the ranking algorithm 

to use in sorting and filtering the returned results. 

The current version of the specification recommends the use of the Atom Ranking 

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-snell-atompub-feed-index-10] draft extension. This extension provides 

for an encoding of enumerated ranking schemes, values, and human readable labels.  

 

In addition to using the Atom Ranking extension, it is suggested that an equivalent OpenSearch 

extension encompassing the OGC OWS-7 ADSD recommendations is developed and provided to 

catalog and client developers. 

7.3.2 OpenSearch Semantic extension 

The Opensearch Semantic Extension 

(http://www.opensearch.org/Community/Proposal/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Semantic/1.0/

Draft_1) offers a set of search operators that are suitable to search records that are classified with terms 

defined in authoritative dictionaries, or taxonomies. In particular, the ―classifiedAs‖ operator can match. 

In the scope of OWS-7 requirements , this extension has been extended to provide a way to retrieve 

taxonomies that are supported by the ADSD. 

Therefore, adding this extension to the set of supported OpenSearch extensions is a possible solution to 

fulfill the usecase where the client first retrieves the set of supported authoritative dictionaries from the 

ADSD, and then requests all records classified by terms from these dictionaries. 

7.3.3 Directory Atom Response 

To demonstrate how the ADSD would encode a response, the following example highlights the query 

and response capabilities in searching for ―Weather‖ data in an ADSD.  

The resulting output is Atom entries for each data source with additional OpenSearch elements to 

include the query elements, pagination. The <category /> and <re:rank /> elements are used within an 

entry to provide category tags as well as relative rankings across two quantitative metrics: reliability and 

popularity. The actual calculation of these values are beyond the scope of the OWS-7 testbed, but each 

ADSD can provide sufficient metrics and methods as appropriate for the specific domain.

7.4 Suggested use of OpenSearch Ranking Extension 

The previous example demonstrated how a simple term query returned ordered results based on 

rankings. The next step would be to provide an OpenSearch Extension in the ogc:authority namespace 

that allows for specifying the ranking algorithm as well as minimum and maximum filters on this 

ranking. 

<Url type="application/atom+xml"  

    template="http://example.com/search.atom?q={searchTerms} 

        &ranking={ogc:authority:ranking}&minrated={ogc:authority:minranking} 

        &maxrated={ogc:authority:maxranking}"/> 

 

By providing a filter capability, ADSD clients can quickly discover and pivot through large sets of 

results to find relevant data sources based on necessary criteria. 

1. "ogc:authority:ranking" - denotes the specific ranking algorithm to sort or filter by. If not 

minimum or maximum is included, catalog should return sorted by this ranking. 

2. "ogc:authority:minranking" - denotes the minimum rating to filter using the ranking algorithm 

3. "ogc:authority:maxranking" - denotes the maximum rating to filter using the ranking algorithm 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 22 

Using the example from the previous section, an actual query may look like: 

GET http://example.com/search.atom?q=Weather&ranking=reliability&minrated=5300 

 

The result would be an Atom document with only sources that had a reliability rating higher than 5300. 

The ranking methods and specific quantitative measures are dependent on the implementation details of 

the ADSD and should follow standard organizational or industry metrics when possible. 
 

7.5 Atom Categories and ebRIM classification schemes 

As designed, an ADSD can utilize any schema of categories. In OWS-7, the Human Terrain 

classification scheme (see below) was created from research to be used for feature and statistical 

analysis (FSA). A sample of an ebRIM classification scheme as it is stored in the CSW registry looks 

like: 
 

<rim:ClassificationScheme id="urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain" isInternal="true" 

nodeType="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:NodeType:UniqueCode" objectType="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-

regrep:ObjectType:RegistryObject:ClassificationScheme" status="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-

regrep:StatusType:Approved"> 

    <rim:Name> 

        <rim:LocalizedString charset="ISO-8859-1" xml:lang="en" value="Human Terrain"/> 

    </rim:Name> 

    <rim:ClassificationNode code="REL" id="urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain:REL" 

objectType="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:ObjectType:RegistryObject:ClassificationNode"             

parent="urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain" path="" status="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-

regrep:StatusType:Approved"> 

        <rim:Name> 

            <rim:LocalizedString charset="ISO-8859-1" xml:lang="en" value="Religion"/> 

        </rim:Name> 

         <rim:ClassificationNode code="ReligiousFacility" 

id="urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain:REL:ReligiousFacility" 

objectType="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:ObjectType:RegistryObject:ClassificationNode" 

parent="urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain:REL" path="" status="urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-

regrep:StatusType:Approved"> 

            <rim:Name> 

                <rim:LocalizedString charset="ISO-8859-1" xml:lang="en" value="Religious Facility"/> 

            </rim:Name> 

            <rim:Description> 

                 <rim:LocalizedString charset="ISO-8859-1" xml:lang="en" value="Facility where religious 

events and practices take place."/> 

            </rim:Description> 

        </rim:ClassificationNode> 

    </rim:ClassificationNode> 

... 

</rim:ClassificationScheme> 

 

Other pre-loaded schemes include Data Reliability, Source Reliability, Security Scheme and Restriction. 
 

These schemes will be made available from each catalog implementation in various formats. For 

example, to get the Human Terrain scheme back in ebRIM format users would execute something like:  

GET http://ows-7.example.net/wes/serviceManagerCSW/csw?request=GetRecordById 

&id=urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain&service=CSW&elementSetName=full 

&outputSchema=urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:xsd:rim:3.0 

 

To get the scheme back in Atom format users would execute something like: 

GET http://ows-7.example.net/wes/opensearch/categories.atom 

&category=urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain 

http://ows-7.example.net/wes/serviceManagerCSW/csw?request=GetRecordById&id=urn:ogc:def:categories:ows7:humanterrain&service=CSW&elementSetName=full&outputSchema=urn:oasis:names:tc:ebxml-regrep:xsd:rim:3.0

The basic idea here is that a user has one or more data sets / services they want publish. Using the 

ADSD client these schemes are displayed in such a way the user can classify their data with them. Using 

OpenSearch Semantic the user would then find these classifications as part of the search results. To do 

this OWS-7 recommends using the category tag. 

Below is a sample Atom entry that utilizes this tag:  

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

The category tag above has three main attributes: 

term: The "term" attribute is a string that identifies the category to which the entry belongs. In this case, 

the term is an identifier which is part of the scheme defined in the scheme attribute.  

scheme: The "scheme" attribute is an URI that identifies a categorization scheme. 

label: The "label" attribute provides a human-readable label for display in end-user applications.

OWS-7 also recommends that each entry above contain a link to DDMS metadata document so that a 

more detailed version of the metadata may be viewed.  

For example: 

... 

<link rel="related" href="http://ows-

7.example.net/wes/serviceManagerCSW/csw?request=GetRecordById&amp;id=12BFDC6E-8884-BC97-4BE6-

S/3.0" title="accessLink"/> 

... 

 

Notice how the category tag above resembles the ddms:category in the in the DDMS document below. 

DDMS sample:

7.6 OWS Context Documents and the CSW Catalog 

In OWS-7 various types of items should be able to be both published and discovered. These include 

services such as WMS (Web Map Service), WFS (Web Feature Service), WCS (Web Coverage 

Service), and SOS (Sensor Observation Service). As well as datasets such as KML/KMZ (Keyhole 

Markup Language), SLD (Styled-Layer Descriptor), and OWS Context Documents (OWC). Other types 

include web sites, books, images, and video. One of the main focuses of OWS-7 is to provide the ability 

to publish and discover OWS Context Documents (OWC).  

 

7.7 Query/Response API for CSW and OpenSearch 

Below is a sample CSW GetRecords request/response for an OWS Context Document stored in the 

registry.

7.7.3 Role of the ADSD Results in Publication 

The ADSD results will be returned as an Atom Response. That response could be thought of as a first 

draft OWS Context. The results should then be expanded into a more extensive OWS Context 

document.  

7.7.4 Population of the ADSD 

Population of the ADSD was agreed to be primarily a ‗behind the scenes‘ activity within the OWS-7 

testbed. The primary goal was to provide a better interface to identify authoritive data, and integrate the 

search with the process of exploitation and info-sharing. As such population was ad-hoc.  

Population could be by open standards methods such as AtomPub or CSW-ebRIM Harvesting, or 

proprietary mechanisms.  Population could also occur from either publication of Context Documents or 

identification of key sources accessed by context documents, but this area was also excluded from the 

OWS-7 Implementation.  

There is a good potential through open submission of content to an ADSD that more data is found and 

determined to be relevant through usage and annotation. Common standards such as AtomPub allow for 

―bookmarking‖ and publishing relatively straightforward and encourage development of new clients that 

could be integrated into existing tools such as web browsers and desktop clients.

7.7.5 Reference Information 

Information such as classification schemes/code-lists/type hierarchies need to be referenced by the 

ADSD. These may be stored in the registry which is supporting the ADSD but it may be appropriate to 

have these available as an independent service. 

7.8 Summary 

This section described the specific encodings of data source directories and rankings in Atom XML 

formats as exposed through OpenSearch-capable services. The code lists were referenced in ebRIM-

XML as well as Atom entries to align with broadly accessible, existing tools. Future research should 

investigate the use of JSON and other encodings tht align with the Atom XML format encodings such 

that these other formats can be used by client services.

8 Engineering Viewpoint 

The Engineering Viewpoint describes specific components linked by a communications network and is 

concerned with the interaction of distinct computational objects. This section describes the discovery of 

the OpenSearch Query endpoint of an ADSD server, formulation of the Query with an Atom response 

including authoritativeness measurements. 

The more formal model, which is predicated on CSW (ebRIM), does allow clients with the capability to 

interact in a more precise way, relevant to more authoritative searches. 

In addition there is a need to allow content to be passed back, and at present the premise is that this is 

relatively formal.  

The overall model of the ADSD interactions as related to the use cases is shown below.  

 
Figure 5: Search Architecture of an ADSD Catalog and Open Internet Sites 

 



OGC 10-086r1

Figure 6: Overall Model of ADSD Interfaces 

  

The arrows in the diagram show the predominant direction of dataflow, obviously transactions proceed 

in both directions. The transactional models for the above are shown below. The client potentially needs 

to deal with all of these, although the CSW and OpenSearch interfaces allow alternative clients to 

exploit the data even if they don‘t support both interfaces. 

 
Figure 7: ADSD Interface Exchange Formats 

  

A number of potential solution architectures exist to satisfy this interface. It is an open question as to 

whether to describe the ADSD as purely the above or whether to break this down into more components. 

It is possible that a single component (as is proposed in the OWS Technology Demonstration) could 

deliver the ADSD. And alternative view, with the ADSD being a broker not dependent on CSW is 

described below. 

The premise of the diagram below is that the ADSD is orchestrated by a series of components, all 

complying with the OpenSearch interface, extended to support geo-temporal queries. The key issue is 

that while a CSW may be one way to deliver ADSD content it may be appropriate to integrate other 

services that are capable of delivering content.

In the OWS-7 test bed, these are the components that played a role in the ADSD architecture:

 OpenSearch 

 OpenSearch extensions: Geo, Time, Suggestions, Ranking, Relevance, and Semantics 

 An Integrated Client 
 

8.1 OpenSearch Discovery 

Reference the InfoSharing ER for specific details on discovering, searching, and results from an 

OpenSearch service. 

8.2 CSW Catalogs 

8.2.1 Storing OWS Context Documents (OWC) in the CSW Catalog 

Storing the OWC document in the CSW registry requires using the CSW Transaction operation. For 

CSW implementors using ebRIM, OWS-7 recommends using an wrs:ExtrinsicObject to represent this 

document. The transaction below outlines what a sample Insert CSW transaction might look like.

The wrs:ExtrinsicObject extends the rim:ExtrinsicObject by adding the repositoryItemRef tag. This is 

used to store the URL of the actual OWC document which the object represents. 

8.2.2 Defining the Required Elements 

In the transaction above you will notice a number of slots defined. These slots are defined by the basic 

extension package for ebRIM and are directly related to the core queryables and presentables defined in 

the catalog services specification (see OGC 07-006r1). Notice how most of these Slots use the 

AnyValue element to accommodate multiple languages. Although this is not mandatory it is highly 

recommended.  

Table 3 below shows the mappings between the various registry objects defined in the transaction and 

the common queryable and returnable elements defined in the OGC specification.

9 Technology Viewpoint 

This Technology viewpoint presents the current technology capable of delivering the ADSD Capability 

from Services through to client and in particular focuses on the implementation of the Testbed. 

9.1 Scenario 

The OWS-7 ADSD scenario is modeled on data and collaboration in response to the January 12, 2010 

earthquake in Haiti. Following the immediate earthquake and in the days and weeks following numerous 

organizations gathered, registered, generated, and analyzed large amounts of geospatial data.  

The workflow in this scenario highlights the use of multiple ADSDs as well as the general internet for 

an analyst to discover and access this data. 

This viewpoint is intended to describe the state of current technology in being able to support the 

evolving ADSD standards. Within OWS-7 the primary evaluation of this is the demonstration 

infrastructure itself. This is shown in figure 1 below. The primary goal is to demonstrate how a client 

can interact with an OpenSearch service with Geo-support and exploit the results effectively. 

 

Figure 9: OWS-7 Technology Implementation 

 

9.2 Technology Deployment 

The demonstration in OWS-7 in most cases did not try to amalgamate the results from the various 

OpenSearch feeds, but just allowed the ADSD Client User to connect to each of them, return results to 

the user, and allow them to explore. One participant federated the OpenSearch query to ADSDs, 

YouTube, and Wikipedia.  

The technology provided by different vendors to support this is as follows:

10 Summary Of Issues Identified/Further Work Suggestions 

The ADSD sub-thread explored the ability of a decision support system to provide a unified 

environment for searching and reviewing all these different types of information resources through a 

single interface (while other sub-threads of the Feature and Decision Fusion thread of OWS-7 provided 

a unified environment for storing, and analyzing these information resources). For this work we adopted 

the OpenSearch metaphor for search, since it has become the most universal interface for searching 

content on the Web. If we wanted to have a search paradigm that was able to interface with all the 

content available on public and private networks, OpenSearch seemed the most promising technology 

available.  

OpenSearch describes the search capabilities of a service, and we extended it to support some common 

functionality, such as the ability to constrain a search based on geographic and temporal parameters. 

This was quite straightforward, and has been done many times before. What was not straightforward 

was how we would bring the concept of ―authoritativeness‖ to this mass-market search interface. 

Conceptually, we felt that authoritativeness is a combination of many factors. The most common factor 

is how much trust one has in the data source and the data source‘s publisher.  

Organizations such as the Geoconnections, USGS, NGA, the UN, and Landgate to name a few, expend 

great amounts of time and effort to create comprehensive and updated data sets with excellent metadata. 

Any data set acquired from these organizations is almost certainly ―authoritative‖. But one can rarely 

rely on organizations like these for all one‘s data needs. Identifying authoritativeness in data sets from 

less structured sources is more complex, and involves being able to account for authoritative concepts 

built up using ―the wisdom of crowds‖ theory. OWS-7 was able to delve into these concepts in some 

depth, but there is still a wealth of research and prototyping experience required to fully explore the 

agenda set out here. This section identifies some areas that participants have identified for future work. 

10.1 How to deal with non-authoritive sources (Non CSW) 

Some experimentation was done in this area . A model that attempted to provide some structure to 

unstructured (and not explicitly geocoded) information.  The concept was to take a general query (of the 

form ‗Morbidity in Haiti‘ and translate ‗in Haiti‘ into specific queries (using the gazetteer to identify 

relevant points in Haiti, e.g. Adminstrative areas and issuing each of these as specific queries). The 

results were associated with the points used to query. So the outcome of the OpenSearch ADSD request 

would be results that included the geo-tagging. Experimentation was done in delivering this in KML that 

allowed it to be easily displayed in a simple OpenLayers client.  The model used is shown below 

(although steps 4 and 5 were not implemented and are really necessary to reduce the ‗noise‘ in the 

results. 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 40 

 

This search model hit two specific services (a gazetteer and a public search engine.  

While not full functional this demonstrated that an approach like this might offer valuable input to the 

ADSD and results in an ‗authoritative‘ document which references useful non-authoritive sources. These 

sources are only vaguely related to a map but offer potentially information that can be exploited. These 

can be easily accessed via an OpenSearch Query and returned via an Atom result set (and potentially as 

a context document. 

10.2 Community based Ranking 

One area considered was community based ranking (potentially derived from either a well-defined 

community, from explicit inputs (e.g. Amazon or eBay rankings) or from examining the number of 

context documents a dataset was used in. While no specific experimentation was done here, the general 

approach is believed to be valid and useful and can easily be accommodated in both OpenSearch/Atom 

and ebRIM. 

10.3 Population of ADSD using open standards 

The issue of population of ADSD and harvesting was considered but was not a major focus in OWS-7. 

In the end all population was undertaken by proprietary or existing methods, e.g. CSW harvesting. And 

the general view was that at present there is no specific need to address this in OpenSearch. A viable 

option would be to use the Atom Publishing Protocol, AtomPub, in order to provide easy discovery and 

interfaces for populating the ADSD as well as annotations and updates. However this area might be 

considered for a future OWS Testbed. 

10.4 Delivering to truly general clients (web browsers) 

OpenSearch does allow users to access a specific search model from the displayed web site using the 

browser. 



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 41 

 

The experimentation in OWS-7 didn‘t try to experiment with this as the primary interface was an 

integrated client. The question as to how easily the ADSD service can be used in ‗generic‘ clients (such 

as browsers) may ultimately be the test of inter-operability. This is a topic for a future OWS Testbed. 

10.5 Inclusion of semantic interface options (interoperability) 

The idea of semantic extensions to OpenSearch was discussed. As with some of the other approaches the 

general conclusion was that these extensions might simply overload the OpenSearch interface with 

complexity that is unnecessary. A concept that is considered relevant is to use semantic information 

(available in say CSW or another underlying support paradigm) to support providing hints to the user 

(related searches etc). This seems to offer the most benefit.  This requires further experimentation. 

10.6 Publishing Context Documents into ADSD and their ‘Harvesting’ for sources 

Context Documents can be considered as search result outputs, either from a response from an ADSD or 

generated from a client application. There are potentially a number of ways a Context could be 

published. These are: 

1.      Addition using a proprietary technology to add them to the catalogue (as was accepted for other 

objects in OWS-7). 

2.      Add them using the transactional CSW (CSW-T) interface. This is the approach assumed in figure 7. 

3.      Add them by using AtomPub. This would mean the ADSD would need to support this additional 

interface. 

4.      Simply publishing them to an end-point via HTTP POST. 

The primary merit of the approach shown in figure 7 (option 2 above) is that publishing to the registry 

allows firstly the context to be version controlled and authoritively referenced. It also allows the registry 

to trigger harvest operations on contexts that are added. This allows them to be automatically published 

and also links in the context to be extracted and used to rank the entries they reference (the approach of 

ranking based on usage). The merits of the other options have not been assessed and do require 

consideration in future work. 

10.7 The merits of CSW versus OpenSearch and Why both are needed. 

The general conclusion in OWS-7 was that these two models offer distinct advantages and have 

distinctly different use cases.  



OGC 10-086r1 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 42 

 CSW (particularly supported by the ebRIM model, although also to some degree relevant to CSW-
ISO) provides a formalized repository and highly structured querying on formalized metadata. This 

is particularly important and relevant to machine access (i.e. the exploiter is automated).  

 

 OpenSearch on the other hand is much more flexible in providing templated query interfaces. As a 
result it is particularly appropriate to human interactions.  

A further conclusion was that mixing up these roles may actually result in a poorer overall result 

(something that doesn‘t do either job well. For example loading OpenSearch with well-defined 

formalized search patterns seems likely to simply obfuscate the interface.  On the other hand making 

CSW ‗loose‘ is not necessarily helpful either. Several implementations in OWS-7 indicated that it is 

possible to deliver an OpenSearch interface from an ebRIM CSW registry/repository and so a specific 

choice is not needed (apart from possibly considering how this mapping can be formalized and whether 

an OpenSearch interface is made mandatory or recommended as an interface to a registry/repository.
