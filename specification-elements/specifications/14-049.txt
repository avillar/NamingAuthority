 A general examination of ontologies in the context of OGC data modeling, 
handling, and organization. Testbed-10 has started to define a consistent set of 
ontologies implementing solid theoretical foundations and semantics.  

 The definition of a core ontologies for representing incident information used by 
Incident Management Systems (IMS) and mapping symbologies used in the 
emergency and disaster management domain with the goal to improve 
interoperability between different IMS symbology sets used across multi-level 
jurisdiction.

Preface 

A significant part of the OGC standards development process is the Interoperability 
Program (IP), which conducts international interoperability initiatives such as Testbeds, 
Pilot Projects, Interoperability Experiments, and Interoperability Expert Services. These 
activities are designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation, demonstration 
and adoption of open, consensus based standards and best practices.  

The OGC Testbed 10 (Testbed-10) is a Testbed within the Interoperability Program. 
Within Testbed-10, the Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) thread seeks to build on 
interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data and advance semantic 
mediation approaches for data discovery, access and use of heterogeneous data models 
and heterogeneous metadata models. This thread explored the creation of domain 
ontologies and tools to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic data provided 
voluntarily by individuals. One objective was to build integration across all OGC web 
services with the intent to provide a better understanding of service content and the 
relationships or associations that exist between OGC services and resources/content. All 
ontology related work is documented in this engineering report. The Testbed-10 Virtual 
Global Gazetteer Engineering Report (OGC document 14-029) contains further 
information on semantic mediation between services.

OGC® Testbed 10 Cross Community Interoperability (CCI) 
Ontology Engineering Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 
Testbed-10 ontology work focused on three aspects: First, the general examination of 
ontologies in the context of OGC data modeling, handling, and organization. Though 
huge efforts have been invested in modeling geographic information by publishing 
abstract models (ISO 191xx) and implementation specifications for these models (GML, 
KML, etc.), as well as application schemas (e.g. CityML), no implementations of these 
abstract models using taxonomy languages (SKOS) and ontology languages such as 
RDF/S or OWL have been developed in OGC. Testbed-10 has started to define a 
consistent set of ontologies implementing solid theoretical foundations and semantics.  

Second, Testbed-10 examined the definition of a core ontologies for representing incident 
information used by Incident Management Systems (IMS) and mapping symbologies 
used in the emergency and disaster management domain with the goal to improve 
interoperability between different IMS symbology sets used across multi-level 
jurisdiction.  

Third and fully documented as part of the hydrology engineering report, Testbed-10 
addressed ontology mapping between hydrology feature models using SPARQL and 
OWL2.

1.4 Future work 
Future work in envisioned as follows: 

1.4.1 Ontology development 

The core geospatial ontologies have been result of eight years of Research and 
Development at Image Matters in the domain of geospatial semantic. Image Matters 
decided to release these ontologies for the broad community seeking to facilitate semantic 
interoperability between systems using geospatial information. The logical next steps are 
a critical review of the provided ontologies and the application of necessary refinements 
and extensions to achieve a comprehensive set of base ontologies. To favor the adoption 
of the geospatial ontologies, improve the robustness and completeness of the 
microtheories, we suggest for the next testbed exercising the ontologies by converting 
existing geospatial data into geospatial knowledge, creating catalogs for unit of measures, 
CRSs and feature types (for gazetteers). The ontologies can also be exercised by creating 
ontologies for more specialized domain that leverage the core geospatial ontologies, as it 
was done for this testbed for E&DM. The result of these activities should lead to 
identifying best practices and provides a rich set of examples how geospatial ontologies 
could be used for different vertical communities and be queried using open linked data 
standards and protocols (Linked Data Platform, GeoSPARQL). 

1.4.2 GeoSPARQL 2.0 

Based on feedback from the OGC Geospatial Semantic WG and lessons learned from 
Testbed-10, there is a need to modularize and simplify GeoSPARQL specification. The 
Testbed-10 geospatial ontologies address many of these aspects (for example 
modularization of spatial relations), and could be used as a starting point.  
The next testbed should demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the approach by 
implementing the specifications.

1.4.3 Core LEAPS and E&DM Domain Ontologies 

We recommend building a set of core domain ontologies for the law enforcement and 
public safety as well as the emergency and disaster management domain.  
As it is important to accommodate jurisdiction-specific and mission-specific profile 
requirements, it is necessary to identify key points of interoperability in a given service 
oriented architecture. As an example, the next test bed might investigate Abu Dhabi 
Police’s (ADP) System of System (SoS) architecture, defining the required interoperable 
service APIs and models, as well as the roadmap for achieving a prioritized 
implementation of these key interfaces and models. The Abu Dhabi Police have 
submitted a comprehensive set of domain models to OGC for Law Enforcement and 
Public Safety (LEAPS). These models can be used to derive a set of foundational 
ontologies that serve as the basis for interoperability throughout ADP’s system of 
systems LEAPS domain. The purpose of this task is to formalize and semantically-
ground ADP’s LEAPS domain models as ontologies. These ontologies will be built upon 
OGC’s Geospatial Ontology, and they will define the minimum-essential core set of 
concepts, properties and relationships for the LEAPS community.    
The LEAPS ontologies must be designed to accommodate any jurisdiction/mission 
profile specific information (taxonomies, specialized concepts and relationships), using 
the built-in extension mechanisms of OWL. The ontologies will be exercised by building 
“ontology profiles”, mapping existing ADP data to the new domain ontologies, and 
accessing these data through GeoSPARQL endpoints (as highly interoperable and useful 
LEAPS Linked Data). 

1.4.4 Emergency and Disaster Management Mapping Symbologies 

The definition of the symbol and the incident ontology described in this report addresses 
the challenges of semantic mapping between different symbologies used in neighboring 
organizations. During the next testbeds, it is important to further explore this approach 
with at least two symbol sets. To ensure correct semantics, it is important to develop the 
formal model for these sets in cooperation with organizations responsible for those 
symbologies. Otherwise, the risk of incorrect mappings is high.  

This approach would allow further refinement of the formal semantic model outlined in 
this report and in consequence it would allow symbology mediation at conceptual level 
between different sets.

6 Core Geospatial Ontologies 

6.1 Overview 
OGC and ISO TC/211 have done tremendous work in modeling geographic information 
by publishing abstract models (ISO 191xx) and implementation specifications for these 
models (GML, KML, etc. ), as well as application schemas (e.g. CityML). However there 
are no implementations of these abstract models using taxonomy languages (SKOS) and 
ontology languages such as RDF/S or OWL. This situation has created the emergence of 
ad-hoc working groups outside OGC to create ontologies for geospatial information 
(often redundant) such as W3C Geo, Ordnance Survey spatial relationships, Geonames 
ontology and taxonomies for feature types. These ontologies do not follow a 
comprehensive and coherent approach based on solid theoretical foundations. We 
envision that OGC could play a crucial and important role in formalizing and 
standardizing geospatial ontologies to enable the “Semantic Geoweb”. OGC has started 
to make steps in this direction by standardizing the query language for the Semantic Web, 
GeoSPARQL (extending SPARQL with geospatial functions), however this specification 
fails to provide a comprehensive set of ontologies to describe geospatial data, and also 
impose a specific ontology to be used for query language. GML has focused on the 
structure and syntax of geospatial data, enabling syntactic interoperability of geospatial 
data, but fails to capture the semantics of the models, including linking to semantic data 
from other domains.  

A comprehensive unified and extensible semantic framework is needed to represent data 
and metadata to enable true cross-domain interoperability, provide a scalable architecture 



OGC 14-049

to integrate heterogeneous geospatial data, and link to datasets from other domains 
(healthcare, law enforcement, public safety, etc.). Web standards (URI, HTTP) and 
Semantic Web standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SKOS, SPARQL, RIF, Linked Data API, 
etc.) provide the necessary foundation to enable this level of interoperability on the web. 
OGC can leverage these standards and develop a set of core ontologies for geospatial 
information, upon which Community Of Interests (COIs) can build and extend to 
facilitate the semantic interoperability of cross-domain heterogeneous geospatial 
information.  

During the Testbed-10 effort, Image Matters has identified, designed and formalized a set 
of modular geospatial core and cross-domain ontologies in OWL (mereo-topology, 
spatial relations, locations, features, temporal ontologies, geometries, CRS, events, 
measures, etc.). These “ontology components” provide a core ontological foundation for 
geospatial information that is universally applicable to any domains. These core 
ontologies leverages some of existing standard abstract models (ISO 19xxx), but are 
modularized and adapted to better leverage the expressiveness of OWL and favor 
reusability. The resulting Geospatial Ontology can be used as a starting point for building 
the OGC ontological foundation for all common geospatial information that could be 
used across various domains (E&DM, Law Enforcement and Public Safety, Gazetteer, 
Hydrology, Aviation, etc). 

6.2 What is an Ontology? 

6.2.1 Definition 

Ontologies provide a way to share the semantics of concepts in some area of interests. It 
is all about common understanding of essential concepts. A generally accepted short 
definition of ontology is given by Gruber (Gruber, 1993): 

An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. 

The term conceptualization is defined as follows: 

A conceptualization is the combination of objects, concepts, and other entities 
that are assumed to exist in some area of interest and the relationships that hold 
among them. A conceptualization is an abstract, simplified view of the world that 
we wish to represent for some purpose. 

6.2.2 Benefits of ontology 

We can summarize the benefits of ontology as follows: 
 It provides a common and shared understanding/definition about certain key 

concepts in the domain 

 It offers the terms one can use when creating RDF documents in the domain. 

 It provides a way to reuse domain knowledge 



OGC 14-049

 It makes the domain assumptions explicit 

 Together with ontology description languages (such as RDFS and OWL), it 
provides a way to encode knowledge and semantics such that the machine can 
understand 

 It makes automatics large scale machine processing become possible 

6.2.3 OWL 

OWL stands for Web Ontology Language, and it is currently the most popular language 
to use when creating ontologies. OWL started as a research-based of the DAML+OIL 
Web Ontology Language. W3C created the Web Ontology Working Group in November 
2001, and the first working drafts of the abstract syntax, reference and synopsis were 
published in July 2002. The OWL documents became a formal W3C Recommendation 
on 10 February 2004. The standardization has triggered the development of OWL 
ontologies in numerous areas of interests. For example, in the life science community, 
OWL is extensively used and has become a de-factor standard for ontology development 
and data exchange.  
The numerous contexts in which OWL has been exercised have helped identifying 
deficiencies in expressiveness and usability in ontology editors. In response to the 
feedback from real-world users, it was decided that an incremental revision of OWL was 
needed. A new W3C OWL working group was officially formed in September 2007. On 
27 October 2009, OWL 2 has become a W3C standard. OWL 1 is a subset of OWL 2, i.e. 
an ontology created by using OWL 1 will be recognized and understood by any 
application that can understand OWL2. 
The W3C OWL 2 Primer has given a good definition of OWL: 
The W3C OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed 
to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations 
between things. OWL is a computational logic-based language such that knowledge 
expressed in OWL can be reasoned with by computer programs either to verify the 
consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge explicit. 
The geospatial ontologies defined by this testbed are using OWL 2 standard. 

6.3 UML versus OWL modeling 
Modeling ontologies is very different than modeling object oriented software artifacts. 
This section attempts to outline the differences and similarities between UML modeling 
and OWL modeling.  
UML is a notation for modelling object oriented software artifacts. OWL is a notation for 
knowledge representation. These are two quite different problems so asking about 
expressivity differences is going to lead you into apples versus oranges comparison. In 



OGC 14-049 

12 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

particular thinking in object oriented terms when working with OWL or RDFS will 
almost always lead you astray.  
To take an example, both OWL and UML have things called "classes" and those classes 
are related in some sort of hierarchy that you can depict via a diagram. However, they are 
not the same notion at all. 
In UML a class is software object. You can create instances of a class and that creation 
process has a procedural semantics involving things like assigning values to attributes 
(aka slots, members). So procedural notions, such as a default value for an attribute 
which is resolved at construction time, is a simple well-defined thing in UML. Instance 
objects also have some associated storage so UML distinguishes between containment 
and association - things are that are stored in the object v. things that are outside the 
object. Instance objects have a runtime semantic so you can have notions of static values 
and mutable values. 
None of that is true in RDFS or OWL or similar languages. In those cases a class is a 
category, it is a label given to a set of things in a domain. In OWL terms a class is simply 
the set of things which are members of that set. So RDFS/OWL has no notion of 
instantiating or constructing an instance and so no notion of default values for instance 
creation. If you have a resource and it meets the criteria for membership of the class then 
it is a member of that class; if you didn't already know that your resource was in that 
class then you can derive this information by reasoning. Asserting a property on a 
resource (or discovering such an assertion) can lead to you inferring that it is a member of 
further classes. Resources (in RDFS terms, Individuals in OWL terms) are not things 
with state, storage or runtime semantics. They are simply identifiers for things in your 
domain. Assertions about those resources can be made, found or derived but the 
resources themselves aren't objects with slots and so notions like static and public/private 
have no meaning here. This is not a limitation of OWL or RDFS so much as the 
fundamental nature of what you are modelling. OWL classes are like labels for concepts, 
UML classes are like templates that define a runtime object and its storage. 
Despite all these differences there is however some connection between both modeling 
languages. Both UML and OWL are languages for modelling. They are modelling totally 
different things and so have different capabilities and a completely different approach to 
semantics but there are some structural similarities. MOF (Meta Object Facility) is the 
meta-modelling tool that underlay UML. It is a language in which you can express other 
modelling languages. So UML is specified in MOF. You can do the same for RDFS and 
OWL - that is, express their metamodels in MOF. This is what ODM (Ontology 
Definition Metamodel) provides which provides a profile for writing RDF and OWL 
within UML. It also includes mappings between UML and OWL as well as mappings 
amongst RDF, RDFS, Common Logic and Topic Maps.

This discussion should highlight why modeling ontologies cannot be done by simply 
converting (automatically or not) UML diagram to OWL. Ontologies are better designed 
from the ground-up but can be informed by concepts expressed in UML models. 

6.4 Design Approach 
This section outlines some the key principles used to design the geospatial core 
ontologies.  

6.4.1 Minimal ontological commitment 

Our modular design of the ontologies follows the principle of making a minimal 
ontological commitment to the nature of concepts and of relationships between concepts. 
As explained by Thomas Gruber, an ontology should require the minimal ontological 
commitment sufficient to support the intended knowledge sharing activities. An ontology 
should make as few claims as possible about the world being modeled, allowing the 
parties committed to the ontology freedom to specialize and instantiate the ontology as 
needed (which is often called ontology profile).  

Opting for such a minimal approach is made dramatically easier by the vocabulary 
extension mechanisms offered natively by Semantic Web technology. Applications that 
require more constrained behavior may define compatible extensions to OWL or SKOS. 
For example, modelers may coin sub-classes and sub-properties of OWL or SKOS 
properties, or associate those properties with specific formal axioms. By making a 
minimal ontological commitment, the ontologies can be applied and reused across 
multiple Communities of Interests (COIs), thus increasing the rate of wide-spread 
adoption. 

6.4.2 Modularization of ontologies 

Quoting Stuckenschmidt and Klein (Stuckenschmidt & Klein, 2004), “ontologies that 
contain thousands of concepts cannot be created and maintained by a single person”. 
Modularization helps designers manage complexity by reducing the size of the design 
problem (Stuckenschmidt, Parent, & Spaccapietra, 2009). We want designers design 
modules of a size that they can apprehend, and later either integrate these modules into a 
final repository or build the relationships among modules that support interoperability. 
This is a typical application of the divide-and-conquer principle.  
Modularization also provides a way to keep performance of ontology services at an 
acceptable level. Performance concerns may be related to query processing techniques, 
reasoning engines and ontology modeling and visualization tools. Reasoners currently 
available are performing well on small-scale ontologies, with performance degrading 
rapidly as the size of the ontology increases. Keeping ontologies small is one way to 
avoid the performance loss, and modularization is a way to replace an ontology that tends 
to become oversized by smaller subsets. Modularization fulfills the performance goal if, 
whenever a query has to be evaluated or an inference to performed, this can be done by 



OGC 14-049 

14 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

looking at just few modules, rather than exploring the whole ontology (Stuckenschmidt et 
al., 2009).  

6.4.3 Reusability of ontologies 

Reusability is a well-known goal in software engineering. Reuse is most naturally seen as 
an essential motivation for approaches aiming at building a broader, more generic 
repository from existing, more specialized repositories. However, it may also apply to the 
inverse approaches aiming at splitting an ontology into smaller modules. In this case, the 
decomposition criterion should be based on the expected reusability of a module, i.e. how 
well can a module fill the purpose of various applications. Reusability emphasize the 
need for rich mechanisms to describe module, in a way that maximizes the chances for 
modules to be understood, selected and used by other services and applications. 

6.4.4 Understandability 

An obvious prerequisite to the ability to use ontology to understand its content. Whether 
the content is shown in visual or textual format, understanding is easier if the ontology is 
small (a module). Small ontologies are undoubtedly preferable if the user is a human 
being. Size, however is not the only criterion that influences understandability. The way 
it is structured contributes to improving or decreasing understandability. 

6.5 OWS10 Geospatial Ontologies overview 
The ontologies are organized into set of microtheories. Microtheory is defined as follows: 

A microtheory is a coherent and consistent set of facts, ontologies, and rules 
that describe a specific sub-domain.  

The surrounding semantic context of a microtheory binds the microtheory to a well-
formed, unified problem space. Microtheories partition the knowledge base into a 
coherent collection of concepts, facts, and rules pertaining to one limited realm of 
knowledge domain. Unlike a knowledge base, a microtheory must be free of 
contradictions. Microtheories can inherit from each other and are organized in a 
hierarchy, which also must be consistent (free of contradictions) between microtheories.  
This microtheory consistency requirement is extremely important in the application of 
ontologies to sophisticated machine reasoning, and is often the downfall of imprecisely 
crafted ontologies. Thus, the consistency requirement differentiates microtheories from 
more commonplace, but less rigorous ontologies that are little more than embellished 
taxonomies. 

In the context of this work, each microtheory consists of a set of well-scoped ontology 
modules containing concepts and relationships that a reasoning engine can interpret 
against a body of knowledge. The rules are based on the semantic of the OWL 2. The 
following subsections give an overview of each microtheory starting from the most 
general to more specialized. For better readability, the documentation of these ontologies

is available online at http://ows10.usersmarts.com/ows10/ontologies/. This work defines 
the baseline for future modifications and refinements. The following figure provides an 
overview of the defined microtheories.

Figure 2: Microtheory excerpt 

6.5.1 Common Microtheory 

The Common Microtheory is composed of ontology modules that are reusable across all 
other ontologies (not only geospatial). It consists of the following modules: 

 Upper ontology  

 Collections 

 Identifier  

 Relations 

 Role 
These ontologies have been influenced by BFO, DOLCE, SUMO, and ODP 
(ontologydesignpatterns.org). 

6.5.2 Mereotopology Microtheory 

Mereotopology is a first-order theory, embodying mereological and topological concepts, 
of the relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the boundaries between parts 
[Wikipedia]. Barry Smith, Anthony Cohn and his coauthors Smith and Varzi (Smith, 
1996; Varzi, 1996) alone and with others, have all shown that mereotopology can be 
useful in formal ontology and computer science, by formalizing relations such as contact, 
connection, boundaries, interiors, holes, and so on. Mereotopology has been most useful 
as a tool for qualitative spatial-temporal reasoning, with constraint calculi such as the 
Region Connection Calculus (RCC). We consider this microtheory as foundational for 
building any geospatial ontologies. 

The Mereotopology Microtheory is composed of ontology modules related to topological 
and mereological concepts and relations. We consider this microtheory as foundational 
for building any geospatial ontologies. 

The initial version consists of the following modules: 
 Topological Objects 

 Topological Relations  

 Topological Primitives  

 Mereology 

6.5.3 Temporal Microtheory 

The Temporal Microtheory is composed of ontologies related to temporal concepts and 
relations. The initial version consists of following group of ontologies: 

 Temporal Entities composed of temporal objects and regions such as time tnstant 
and time interval,  



OGC 14-049 

18 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

 Temporal topological relations among temporal entities,  

 Temporal reference systems,  

 Temporal units and quantities (duration, frequency,..).  
The microtheory has been influenced by a number of ontologies and models (OWL-
Time, ISO 19108, CNTRO 2.0, BFO, SWRL Temporal, NASA SWEET).  

6.5.4 Spatial Microtheory 

The Spatial Microtheory is composed of ontologies related to spatial concepts and 
relations. The initial version consists of following modules: 

 Spatial entities composed of spatial objects inhering spatial qualities and spatial 
regions.  

 Spatial relationships (RCC8, Egenhofer, simple features topological relationships, 
relative relationships).  

 Geometries (Core geometry, GML geometries, Simple Feature Geometry). 

 CRS and Datum 

 Place 

 Spatial properties, quantities and units 

 Spatial Mereology 
Some of the ontology modules (geometries, spatial relationships) are the results of 
modularization of GeoSPARQL ontology and links to GeoSPARQL specification are 
encoded in the ontology when applicable.  

6.5.5 Measures microtheory 

The Measures Microtheory is composed of ontologies related to measurements of 
qualities or quantities. The initial version consists of the following modules: 

 Measure 

 Measurement Scale 

 Reference Systems 

 Quantity 

 Observable Properties 
The microtheory has been influenced by a number of ontologies and models (QUDT, 
OGC O&M, NASA SWEET,EngMath, MUO, OBO UO). The quantity ontology 
extensively leverages little-known but elegant OWL 2 technique called punning, which 
consists of a class playing the role of a class and an instance of a metaclass at the same 
time. By using this technique, dimensionality of quantity are kept coherent. This 
microtheory is used to define spatial and temporal measures. 



OGC 14-049

6.5.6 Event microtheory 

The event microtheory is composed of ontology modules related to event concepts and 
relations. It is using the spatial and temporal microtheory to describe time and place of 
events. The initial version is composed of the following modules: 

 Event Object 

 Event relations 
The microtheory has been influenced by a number of ontologies and models (DOLCE, 
Event Ontology, F-Model, Simple Event Model). This microtheory was used to describe 
an ontology for modeling Incident in the context of Emergency and Disaster Management 
(E&DM). 

6.5.7 Feature microtheory 

The feature microtheory is used to model OGC Feature Model. It defines the concepts of 
Feature and FeatureCollection and is derived from the Spatial Object ontology. This 
ontology expresses geospatial concepts using OGC Feature terminology.  

6.6 Deployment information 
The ontologies have been deployed at the following endpoint: 
http://ows10.usersmarts.com/ows10/ontologies/. The homepage shows the different 
microtheories with their respective modules. When accessing a module, an ontology 
documentation is generated automatically from the source ontology. All the ontologies 
have been licensed under Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution 3.0 United States. Source 
ontology can be accessed in RDF/XML or Turtle format from the documentation page.  

6.7 Next Steps 
The core geospatial ontologies have been result of eight years of Research and 
Development at Image Matters in the domain of geospatial semantic. Image Matters 
decided to release these ontologies for the broad community seeking to facilitate semantic 
interoperability between systems using geospatial information. The intent is to bootstrap 
the Geospatial Semantic Web, by providing an initial candidate geospatial ontologies for 
standardization. We think a joint effort between OGC and W3C would be the right venue 
to bring this work to maturation and standardization due to their expertise both in 
geospatial domain and semantic web respectively.  

6.7.1 Path to standardization  

Some of the work occurring at ISO TC 211 to convert ISO TC 191xxx models to OWL 
could be leveraged, by improving some of the microtheories that are not fully completed 
(Coordinate Reference System for example). However we strongly caution of the use of 
an automatic conversion from UML model to OWL , as pointed out in the previous 
section discussing the difference between UML modeling and OWL modeling. We 
believe that careful manually crafted ontologies, consistent with other microtheories will 
provide better results.  



OGC 14-049 

20 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

To favor the adoption of the geospatial ontologies, improve the robustness and 
completeness of the microtheories, we suggest for the next testbed exercising the 
ontologies by converting existing geospatial data into geospatial knowledge, creating 
catalogs for unit of measures, CRSs and feature types (for gazetteers). The ontologies can 
also be exercised by creating ontologies for more specialized domain that leverage the 
core geospatial ontologies, as it was done for this testbed for E&DM. The result of these 
activities should lead to identifying best practices and provides a rich set of examples 
how geospatial ontologies could be used for different vertical communities and be 
queried using open linked data standards and protocols (Linked Data Platform, 
GeoSPARQL). 

6.7.2 GeoSPARQL 2.0 

Based on feedback from the OGC Geospatial Semantic WG and lessons learned from 
Testbed-10, there is a need to modularize and simplify GeoSPARQL specification. The 
Testbed-10 geospatial ontologies address many of these aspects (for example 
modularization of spatial relations), and could be used as a starting point. GeoSPARQL 
provides a geospatial extension of SPARQL by defining geospatial function extensions 
and data types (in the same way Spatial SQL extends SQL). GeoSPARQL could be 
simplified by clearly defining geospatial functions using SPARQL Service Description 
vocabulary standard and the geospatial datatypes (WKT Literal and GML Literal). The 
query language should be independent of the ontology describing geospatial concepts 
(the same way Spatial SQL is independent of relational models). We believe that this 
simplification and modularization of the specification will foster the adoption of the 
specification to a larger community. 
There is also a need to describe the capabilities of GeoSPARQL. These descriptions 
provide a mechanism by which a client or end user can discover information about the 
SPARQL service such as supported extension functions and details about the available 
geospatial dataset, supported CRSs, inferences supported. There are a number of 
standards that already exists to describe SPARQL endpoint such as the W3C SPARQL 
1.1 Service Description, VoiD and DCAT. These standards will be adapted to 
accommodate description of GeoSPARQL endpoints, by defining profiles and best 
practices. The next testbed should demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the 
approach by implementing the specifications.  
We believe that this simplification and modularization of the specification will foster the 
adoption of the specification to a larger community. 
 

7 Incident ontology for E&DM 

7.1 Overview 
Incident management plays a crucial role in many application domains including 
Homeland Security, Law Enforcement and Public Safety (LEAPS), Emergency and 
Disaster Management (E&DM). An Incident Management System (IMS) needs to 
facilitate rapid, agile and effective engagement of first responders at national, state and 



OGC 14-049 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 21 
 

local jurisdictional levels to respond to emergency incidents that may pose an immediate 
security threat to human life and/or the flow of commerce. The current systems face the 
following challenges: 

 Analysts and operators need to quickly triage, fuse, connect dots, detect patterns, 
infer insights, and make sense of the flow of incident information to get an 
unambiguous Common Operational Picture 

 Need to integrate and interpret incidents, observations, mutual aid requests, alerts, 
etc. generated across a multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional spectrum 

 Limited interoperability between agencies due to different protocols, taxonomies, 
models and representations (stovepipes are still there!) 

The current data-centric approach mainly based on syntactic and structural approach 
imposes a huge cognitive burden on the user to make sense of the large volume and 
varieties of information.  

Data model standardization relies upon homogeneous data description and organization. 
This imposes strict adherence to a standard that is defined at the syntactic-schematic 
level, whereupon it’s harder to achieve consensus and less flexible. Modelers struggle 
between producing simpler models for which it is easier to gain consensus, but harder to 
achieve desired business reality, versus those seeking richer models that are closer to 
reality but have unwanted complexity.  

Data-centric approaches increase the chance for multiple interpretations and 
misinterpretations of data. Data interpretation requires knowledge of its semantics (e.g., 
meanings, significance, relevance, etc.) and surrounding context. Data-centric approaches 
are unable to capture these semantics and context, which are in turn required for 
automated fusion, analytics, and reasoning.  

To address these challenges, we adopted a knowledge-centric approach. The knowledge-
based approach employs a standards-based formal, sharable framework (RDF, OWL, 
SPARQL) that provides a conceptual domain model to accommodate various business 
needs. Decentralized model extensions can be accommodated without adversely affecting 
existing information infrastructure.  

7.2 Core incident ontology overview 
For Testbed-10 testbed, we investigated the definition of a core ontology for representing 
incident information used by IMS. The goal of this ontology is to provide a semantic 
model for Incident Management systems that could be adapted across multiples domains 
and jurisdictions to enable interoperability of incident management systems between 
these domains. The Incident ontology attempts to capture the minimal set of concepts and 
properties that are truly cross-domain. Using the built-in extensibility and multilingual 
mechanisms of Ontology Web Language (OWL) and Simple Knowledge Organization 
System (SKOS), the Incident ontology can be adapted to build specific profiles for 
Military and Civilian IMS while still being interoperable because they are based on the 



OGC 14-049 

22 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

same core concepts. Our Incident ontology is built-on a set of core ontologies (spatial, 
temporal, identifier, event, SKOS) to provide a coherent model for geospatial reasoning 
on incidents. 

The figure 3 gives an overview of the Incident Ontology Model. Incidents are based on 
the Event ontology defined in the Core Geospatial Ontologies. 
 

 
Figure 3: Core incident ontology model 

 

The core Incident Model can be extended using the built-in mechanism in OWL to add 
specific information used within an application domain or jurisdiction, thus becoming 
specialized profile of the core Incident model. Existing standards based on syntactic and 
schematic standards (NIEM, EDXL, NDEX,…) can be integrated in Semantic Incident 
Management Systems by the use of adapters converting the standard to an RDF 
representation using the different incident profiles. The benefit of this approach is to 
provide a unified semantic representation of incidents that can integrate different systems 
without breaking incompatibilities. The knowledge-based model allows machines to 
interpret information without ambiguities, perform triaging, reasoning and fusion of 
information. The system will assist the user by reducing the cognitive burden to make 
sense of the information. The common knowledge-based representation of the incidents 
can be used to convert back the information to existing data-centric standard. The 
semantic layer introduces a layer of ‘smartness’ in the existing IMS that can adapt easily 
to future change in the model.  



OGC 14-049

Figure 4: Semantic layer with adapters to the core incident model and derived profiles 

 
There are a number of data-centric standards that are used in existing standards such as 
NIEM, NDEX, CAP, EDXL, that are applicable to the same approach. We suggest 
investigating a semantic encoding of these standards for future testbeds. The Abu Dhabi 
Police LEAPS Models provide the richest model for the LEAPS domain, and we strongly 
suggest using these models as future baseline for developing a semantic model for 
LEAPS. 
 

7.3 Controlled vocabulary in the emergency and disaster management domain 
There are a number of controlled vocabularies used in IMS systems (incident types, 
severities, statuses, priorities, alert types, etc). In the incident ontology, these 
vocabularies are captured as taxonomies using the Simple Knowledge Organization 
System (SKOS) ontology. SKOS provides a model for expressing the basic structure and 
content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, 
taxonomies, folksonomies, and other similar types of controlled vocabulary. As an 
application of the Resource Description Framework (RDF), SKOS allows concepts to be 
composed and published on the World Wide Web, linked with data on the Web and 
integrated into other concept schemes using semantic mapping constructs.  

In basic SKOS, conceptual resources (concepts) are identified with URIs, labeled with 
strings in one or more natural languages, documented with various note types, 
semantically related to each other in informal hierarchies and association networks, and 
aggregated into concept schemes. 

An advanced SKOS adds the following features:   

1) conceptual resources can be mapped across concept schemes and grouped into 
labeled or ordered collections  



OGC 14-049 

24 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

2) relationships can be specified between concept labels.  

The two most important entities in the SKOS ontology are skos:ConceptScheme and 
skos:Concept. In order to distinguish the type of schemes (Incident Type Scheme, 
Severity Scheme, etc), we introduce in our Incident ontology subclasses of 
ConceptScheme and Concept. Some of the benefits of using SKOS are its multilingual 
support, its extensibility mechanism and interoperable way to share taxonomies based on 
Linked Data Standards. It also provides vocabularies for mapping concepts between 
different taxonomies (skos:exactMatch, skos:narrowerMatch, …), enabling semantic 
mediation on taxonomies. 

These controlled vocabularies are defined outside the Incident ontology, so it could 
accommodate multiple domains (military, civilian, cyberspace …), be controlled by 
authoritative standard bodies and sharable with other systems. Typically these controlled 
vocabularies takes the form of code lists or taxonomies (with broader, narrower terms), 
which can be both be accommodated by SKOS.  

In our Incident ontology, we define the following intrinsic qualities for Incident: 
incidentType, severity, priority and status. The values of these properties are typically 
defined in controlled vocabularies based on the Simple Knowledge Organization System 
(SKOS) ontology.  

In order to support triaging of incidents by systems and end-users, incidents are typically 
classified using well-known controlled taxonomies defining incident categories. To 
accommodate these requirements, our ontology leverage the SKOS ontology by 
introducing a subclass of skos:Concept named IncidentType..  

As an example of Incident Type taxonomies, we use the Homeland Security Working 
Group (HSWG) taxonomies to encode in SKOS

8 Emergency and Disaster Management Symbology  

8.1 Introduction 
A plethora of symbols and symbol schemes exist, but extremely few standardized sets 
can be found despite the big number of initiatives targeting exactly such a standardized 
set. Lots of those initiatives date back to the first decade 2000-2009 and have failed to 
become widely accepted and applied mapping symbol standards.  
The initial goal of Testbed-10 was to identify the standard model for symbology for the 
Emergency and Disaster Management community. The model, formalized in an ontology, 
should describe the translation between different local, federal or international sources

with the homeland security symbology (found at: www.fgdc.gov/HSWG/index.html) as 
the basis for the standard model. 
A number of symbology mapping initiatives have reported progress on standardizing 
symbologies within their country or administrative or organizational boundaries, such as 
the  

 Canadian Emergency Management Symbology (EMS) 
(http://emsymbology.org/EMS/index.html, currently not available); 

 United Nations Office of Coordination on Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA), 
which has created a set of 500 freely available humanitarian icons to help relief 
workers present emergency and crisis-related information quickly and simply 
(http://reliefweb.int/report/world/world-humanitarian-and-country-icons-2012); 

 Portuguese Disaster Response Map Symbols (DRMS) project, an effort to create a 
standard set of symbols that may aid disaster managers and responders to create 
efficient maps (http://www.rpec-cert.info);  

 Australasian All-Hazards Symbology, developed by the Intergovernmental 
Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM) and the Victoria-based company 
Spatial Vision 
(http://www.spatialvision.com.au/index.php/sectors/government/426-australasian-
all-hazards-symbology-project.html); 

 The European INDIGO project Emergency 2D/3D Symbology Reference 
(http://indigo.diginext.fr/EN/index.html); 

 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission efforts on map symbol standardization. 

 
After recognizing the importance of sharing spatial information during emergency 
situations, the Federal Geographic Data Committee Homeland Security Working Group 
(FGDC HSWG) was asked to develop a set of standard symbols to be used by emergency 
personnel during a disaster event. The Emergency and Hazard Management Mapping 
Standard Point Symbology was submitted to, and accepted by, the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) in 2006 as “ANSI 415-2006 INCITS Homeland Security Map 
Symbol Standard” (Akella, 2009).  
For a number of reasons, the standard has so far not been widely adopted across the full 
range of DHC missions (Robinson, Roth, & MacEachren, 2010). The key problem is that 
it is generally extremely difficult to create a map symbol standard across organizations or 
missions (Bianchetti et al., 2012; Robinson, Roth, Blanford, Pezanowski, & MacEachren, 
2012; Robinson et al., 2010). Robinson et al. (Robinson et al., 2010) interviewed fourteen 
mapmakers and users from a wide range of Department of Homeland Security missions 
to identify the main challenges and barriers to use a symbology standard. It turned out 
that most missions use in-house symbols that are better reflecting the specific needs of 
that mission. External symbologies are considered overly complex and ambiguous or use 
a symbol design that does not fit mission specific needs or format constraints. Usually, 
in-house symbols are created in an ad-hoc procedure, not following any standardized 



OGC 14-049

methodology and evolve over time as user and mission requirements call for changes. 
Thus, compared to external standards, in-house symbologies are more agile and easier to 
modify and adapt to latest needs.  

8.2 Semiology of Maps 
“The semiotics of maps, a subfield of cartosemiotics, is the sign-theoretic study of maps“ 
(Schlichtmann, 2009), with map symbolism being the “core subject of the semiotics of 
maps”. The other subjects include sign processes (basically the process from production a 
sign to its reception and the sign employment in cartographic communication), contexts 
(of sign processes), marginal notes (e.g. legends), and peripheral signification (e.g. 
allowing to draw further inferences about other context factors). For further information 
about map symbolism, please be referred to Schlichtmann’s overview of the semiotics of 
maps, which includes a very interesting discussion about the complexity of map 
symbolism (Schlichtmann, 2009). 

8.3 Symbol Types 
To understand the complexity of building a standard mapping symbol ontology for the 
disaster and emergency management domain, it is important to discuss the different types 
of symbols. There is general agreement in literature that symbols can be divided into 
three categories at least (MacEachren, 1995):  

 Geometric symbols, sometimes referred to as abstract symbols (e.g. circles, 
squares, or diamonds), which are often further categorized into point, line, and 
polygon symbols. Those symbols often need a legend with additional information, 
as their meaning is not easily conveyed. 

 Pictoral symbols are also known as image-related or representational symbols, 
are “similar in appearance to their referent”. 

 Associative symbols, can be regarded as “emblems” which represent the referent 
through some analogous relation of parts of other commonly recognized symbols 
in combination. 

In addition to those three categories that are prevalent in literature, there is a fourth, less 
developed category. This category includes symbols that are associative in nature, but 
refer to an event that is less commonly known or for which a no common picturization 
exist, for example a bio-hazard.  

8.4 Symbol Comprehension 
It is necessary to understand symbol comprehension and to define testing algorithms to 
evaluate the congruency of intended meaning of a symbol (by the map producers) and 
received meaning of a symbol (by map consumers). ISO 9186-1:2007 specifies methods 
for testing the comprehensibility of graphical symbols and ISO 9186-2:2008 specifies a 
method for testing the perceptual quality of graphical symbols (ISO, 2008, 2014). ISO 
3864 stipulates a desired level of correctness of 67%, while the American National 
Standards Insitute’s (ANSI Z.535.3) counterpart is 85% (ISO, 2012; Mayhorn, Wogalter, 
& Bell, 2004).

8.4.1 Theory of Affordances and Other Cognitive Factors 

Gibson developed an interactionist view of perception and action that focused on 
information that is available in the environment (Greeno, 1994). His relational theory of 
affordances provides interesting insights into what affects our comprehension of symbols. 
The theory offers an explanation for how people perceive things they see in relation to 
their earlier frames of reference. According to Gibson, people perceive objects in terms 
of what they can offer or afford. Hartson in response to Norman defines and uses four 
complementary types of affordance in the context of interaction design and evaluation: 
cognitive affordance, physical affordance, sensory affordance, and functional affordance 
(Hartson, 2003; Norman, 1999). The cognitive affordance is of particular interest in the 
context of map symbol design and perception. It is a “design feature that helps, aids, 
supports, facilitates, or enables thinking and/or knowing about something”. Thus, clear 
and precise symbols could be a cognitive affordance enabling crisis managers to 
understand the meaning of the symbol. Functional affordance addresses potential actions 
taken by map symbol readers in response to the symbol. 

Other research has shown that both knowledge and display design go hand in hand to 
increase understanding of map symbols. According to Langefors Infologic Equation, the 
understanding of a map symbol does not only depend on the symbol itself, but on the 
individual’s prior knowledge (Porathe & Sivertun, 2002). This aspect makes the symbol 
design process and similarly any symbol set transformation or comparison even more 
complex, as the various levels of knowledge and symbol familiarity need to be 
considered (Garlandini & Fabrikant, 2009; Hegarty, Canham, & Fabrikant, 2010).  

8.4.2 Culture and Gender 

Any symbol set should strive for cultural and gender independence in order to mitigate 
potential misunderstandings. Nevertheless, as recent research has underpinned, culturally 
neutral symbols are rather elusive (Chan, Han, Ng, & Park, 2009). The importance of this 
feature heavily depends on the cultural background of the target communities and might 
be less important in the disaster and emergency management domain. 

8.4.3 Sensory Issues and Differences 

A number of factors affect symbol interpretation that go beyond the general aspects of 
affordances as discussed before. Roughly 10% of the global population is expected to be 
color blind (Hägglund, 2008), which heavily affects color nuances perception and 
red/green or blue/yellow differentiation. Hägglund cites a number of general 
recommendations that can be made:  

 Black, white, yellow and blue are most readily seen by all, even color blind; 
 Red is typically used for warning but red is dull for the color blind; bright yellow 

is preferable to red but may still be mistaken for green by the color blind;  
 Never red and green in the same symbol;  
 Colors and patterns together decrease clarity; black and white patterns more 

differentiable;  



OGC 14-049

 Color differences difficult to perceive when several colors in close proximity in 
limited spaces 

Currently, no symbol set implements all of the recommendations given above, as they 
limit expressiveness and richness of the symbols if applied all together.  

In addition to color blindness related aspects, there are other sensory aspects that may or 
may not be addressed in symbol sets, such as change blindness, foveal vs. peripheral 
attention and effects of speed of change and multiple inputs in exposure to map graphics 
(Ambler & Finklea, 1975; Fish, Goldsberry, & Battersby, 2011; Harrower, 2001). 
Drawing on the work of Simons and Rensink (2005), American geographers Fish, 
Goldsberry and Battersby note the importance of the change blindness “phenomenon 
whereby individuals fail to notice change that occurs in a visual stimulus”. Over a decade 
of research in this area reveals that human beings consistently overestimate their ability 
to detect substantial changes in visual graphics used for example in digital maps (Fish et 
al., 2011).  

8.5 FGDC HSWG Symbol Set 
The US Federal Geographic Data Committee Homeland Security Working Group (FGDC 
HSWG) symbology set, standardized by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI), divides symbols into four categories:  

 Incidents: cause of action or source of disaster; 
 Natural events: phenomenon created by naturally occurring conditions; 
 Infrastructure: basic facilities, services and installations needed for the 

functioning of a community; 
 Operations: capabilities or resources available during or implemented due to an 

emergency. 
Borders and patterns around these shapes are used to visually classify the symbols into 
their respective groups. The FGDC HSWG Emergency Management Symbology is 
designed in black and white. There are concerns regarding the accuracy of the 
Symbology library, the limited reference to point symbols, the large amount of detail in 
the indications of status levels, a very low level of adoption of the FGDC symbology 
library, and the absence of evaluation with regard to cultural independence and 
generalizability. Nevertheless, we used it in this testbed and partially encoded it using the 
Incident ontology and SKOS. 

8.6 Symbology ontology 
For this testbed, we limited the symbology to icon representation, as it is a common 
representation used by E&DM community, but also because the timeframe for this 
testbed was too short to explore other symbol representation (line, area symbology) and 
rules of encoding. We used the Homeland Security Working Group Symbology 
Reference for Incidents and Natural Events as a starting point to develop a semantic 
model to represent symbology. The symbols were encoded in TrueType font files. The 
following figure shows symbology for natural events. 



OGC 14-049

Figure 5: Homeland security symbology for natural events 

The core symbol ontology is very simple. The core concept is PointSymbol. It has a 
symbolName, an associated font and denotes a concept (Natural Event, Incident 
concepts, etc..). The denotes property provides the bridge between the symbol 
representation and the concept it represents. By using semantic mapping between 
concepts, it is possible to associate multiple symbols to one concept or vice-versa and 
perform semantic mediation of symbology  

The following example represents a symbol for a VolcanicEruption event and its font 
definition.

8.7 Datasets investigated 
The testbed was mainly focused on developing a core generic model that could be 
applicable to a number of domains managing incidents.  Due to the fact that we didn’t 
have real datasets to work with, a number of open source datasets were investigated and 
mapped to the Incident ontology.  

 911 Seattle Police dataset 
 OpenFEMA summaries 
 Worldwide Incident Tracking System 

The datasets investigated were however not rich enough to perform a relevant scenario 
that demonstrate the semantic incident management.  We would recommend using some 
real dataset used by LEAPS or E&DM for the next testbed. 

8.8 Recommendations 
Due to the complexity of symbol sets, the difficulties to map between sets of different 
background, culture, tradition, and context, and the heterogeneous symbol 
comprehension factors, establishing a new model based on the FGDC baseline model 
cannot be achieved in a single test bed. Instead, we recommend for future test beds to do 
a direct comparison of two real data sets of neighboring administrative units or of a single 
administrative unit and the FGDC baseline in close cooperation with the symbol set users 
and producers. This approach needs to be combined with OGC base ontology 
development activities as recommended in the previous chapter.  
In addition, we recommend building a set of core domain ontologies for the law 
enforcement and public safety as well as the emergency and disaster management 
domain.  
As it is important to accommodate jurisdiction-specific and mission-specific profile 
requirements, it is necessary to identify key points of interoperability in a given service 
oriented architecture. As an example, the next test bed might investigate Abu Dhabi 
Police’s (ADP) SoS architecture, defining the required interoperable service APIs and 
models, as well as the roadmap for achieving a prioritized implementation of these key 
interfaces and models. The Abu Dhabi Police have submitted a comprehensive set of 
domain models to OGC for Law Enforcement and Public Safety (LEAPS). These models 
can be used to derive a set of foundational ontologies that serve as the basis for 
interoperability throughout ADP’s system of systems LEAPS domain. The purpose of 
this task is to formalize and semantically-ground ADP’s LEAPS domain models as 
ontologies. These ontologies will be built upon OGC’s Geospatial Ontology, and they 
will define the minimum-essential core set of concepts, properties and relationships for 
the LEAPS community.    
The LEAPS ontologies must be designed to accommodate any jurisdiction/mission 
profile specific information (taxonomies, specialized concepts and relationships), using 
the built-in extension mechanisms of OWL. The ontologies will be exercised by building 
“ontology profiles”, mapping existing ADP data to the new domain ontologies, and 
accessing these data through GeoSPARQL endpoints (as highly interoperable and useful 
LEAPS Linked Data).  



OGC 14-049

The testbed should demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the resulting LEAPS 
Ontology and candidate specifications by testing one or more implementations.    
Expected outcome: (1) A set of core ontologies for the LEAPS domain.  (2) Prototype 
applications and services to test and demonstrate profiles of the LEAPS Ontology, 
employing existing LEAPS data and using GeoSPARQL services to access these data.  
Benefits: Demonstrates the benefits of semantically-enabled LEAPS data and services in 
terms of enhanced cross-domain data integration, search and discovery, and service 
interoperability. Pinpoints and tests minimum-essential required building blocks for 
LEAPS interoperability.  Accelerates the path to common, coherent LEAPS Linked Data 
exchange. The roadmap will provide an agile, incremental, prioritized approach to the 
implementation of the key points of interoperability for LEAPS and E&DM SoS. 
 

9 Hydro Model Interoperability 

The Hydro demonstration thread worked on using HY_Feature hydrological model as a 
mediation model to integrate heterogeneous hydrological models. Two models were 
tested. They are the National Hydro Network (NHN) of Canada and the National 
Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus or NHD+) of USA. Semantic mappings were tested 
to achieve hydro data and model conversion and integration among HY_Feature, NHN, 
and NHD+. The test on semantic mappings focused on flow path linear feature. The 
ontologies for all three models and their conversion models were built using OWL with 
Protégé editor. The knowledge store is published through a generic SPARQL engine. The 
examples were documented in the ER in the five use cases - (1) mapping hydrographic 
features from NHD+ to HY_Feature, (2) mapping hydrographic features from NHN to 
HY_Feature, (3) hydrographic mapping between NHD+ and NHN, (4) finding upstream 
service (flow path feature tracing and model conversion), and (5) heterogeneous 
hydrological model integration (across borders of US and Canada).
