1.    Scope

This document is an OGC® Implementation Standard for the representation of the Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements as XML. TimeseriesML 1.2 is implemented as an application schema of the Geography Markup Language version 3.3, making use of the OGC Observations & Measurements standards. TimeseriesML 1.2 is designed as an extensible schema to allow encoding of data to be used in a variety of exchange scenarios. Example areas of usage are: cross-border exchange of observational data; release of data for public dissemination; enhancing disaster management through data exchange; and exchange in support of national reporting. The core aspect of the Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements is the correct, precise description of timeseries. This document defines an implementation of this profile.

2.    Conformance

This standard defines an XML encoding standard for the OGC Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site[1].

In order to conform to this OGC®interface standard, a software implementation shall choose to implement:

a)     Any one of the conformance levels specified in Annex A (normative).

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

The diagrams that appear in this standard are presented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) static structure diagram.

Note: Within the context of this profile, the following color scheme is used to identify the package in which the class exists. This is just for informative purposes.



Blue: Defined within the Timeseries Profile of O&M (conceptual model)



Yellow: Defined within this standard (XML implementation model)



Green: ISO19156 – Observations & Measurements



Red: Other (ISO or GML)

5.3    Finding Requirements and Recommendations

This standard is identified as http://www.opengis.net/spec/timeseriesml/1.2. For clarity, each normative statement in this standard is in one and only one place and defined within a requirements class table and identified with a URI, whose root is the specification URI. In this standard, all requirements are associated to tests in the abstract test suite in Annex A using the URL of the requirement as the reference identifier.

Requirements classes are separated into their own clauses and named and specified according to inheritance (direct dependencies). The Conformance test classes in the test suite are similarly named to establish an explicit and mnemonic link between requirements classes and conformance test classes.

6.    XML Implementation (normative)

In addition to the UML conceptual model this standard defines a GML XML Schema implementation that is compliant to the UML conceptual model. The XML Schemas for this implementation are published at:

http://schemas.opengis.net/tsml/1.2/

Schematron patterns are implemented for some requirements where appropriate and are published at the same location.

6.1    XML encoding principles

The following principles apply to data encoded according to the TimeseriesML 1.2 XML schema.

6.1.1    Conformance to GML 3.3 encoding rules for codelists

This XML Schema implementation imports the OGC GML 3.2.1 schemas. However, codelists are implemented according to the clarified rules for codelists in the OGC GML 3.3 specification. Namely that items in codelists are referred to using gml:ReferenceType and not encoded with gml:CodeType.

None of the GML 3.3 schema types are used in this implementation and therefore only GML 3.2.1 schemas are imported by the TimeseriesML 1.2 XML schemas. This is consistent with the note in the GML 3.3 specification which reads: A GML application schema conforming to this standard will import the GML 3.2 schema plus zero or more additional GML 3.3 schemas as needed.

6.1.2    Extends the OGC Implementation Schema for Coverages

The TimeseriesML schema supports both an interleaved time-value pair encoding and a domain, range encoding. The domain, range encoding inherits from the coverage schema defined in the OGC Implementation Schema for Coverages (09-146r2). The interleaved timeseries encoding is a representation of a special case of the CV_DiscreteCoverage class from OGC Abstract Specification Topic 6, in which each GeometryValuePair has a ‘geometry’ which is a timestamp, and a ‘value’ which is a measure or other simple datatype. The OGC CIS v1.1 specification provides alternative representations of coverages, including an option for interleaving coverages, which can be useful for timeseries of more complex values.

6.1.3    Virtual typing

In accordance with OMXML, the specialization of the OM_Observation result type is provided through schematron restriction. The om:type element may be used to specify the type of OM_Observation that is being encoded. This shall be done using the OGC Name URI for the corresponding type from the following table.

Likewise, a tsml:type property is present on the TimeseriesDomainRange type to enable a soft-typing approach to this class. The values for this property should be taken from Table 2.

6.1.4    Efficiency of encoding

This XML Schema implementation takes the approach that, where conceptual classes can be combined without loss of clarity, they are. For example, the same metadata classes are used for both Categorical and Measurement timeseries. This is to avoid a proliferation of similar classes in the XML encoding.

The following table outlines the mapping between the conceptual model and the XML Schema implementation.

6.1.5    Abstract requirements and conformances classes

 

As noted in the OGC Modular Specification section 6.2, the tests for abstract conformance classes may need to be described in the subclass classes if the base requirements classes are ambiguous for the abstract class. This is the case for the two styles of timeseries conformance classes, domain-range and interleaved (time-value pair). Some requirements for these classes are re-specified in more concrete terms to allow more explicit testing.

6.2    XML Examples

XML examples are published alongside the XML schemas at http://schemas.opengis.net/tsml/1.2/. In all examples, the following namespaces are used.

6.15.1    Requirements class overview

The Collection schema contains a collection element as well as other document specific types.

	
		
		

			
				Figure : XML Implementation of Collection and associated classes
			
		
	


	
	



The XML Schema implementation of Collection maps closely to the conceptual model. The key implementation points to note are that all observationMembers are implemented by OM_Observation, and that ConformanceClass is implemented as a reference (xlink:href) from DocumentMetadata.

6.15.1.1    Collection properties

TimeseriesML defines a generic collection feature type, Collection, to allow the grouping of observations and/or sampling features with metadata to describe the nature of the collection. Such collections are required in a number of data exchange scenarios; whether the underlying transport technology is web services, FTP or other technologies.

				Figure : TimeSeries Metadata XMLSchema Implementation
			
		
	


	
	



The XML Schema Implementation collapses many of the conceptual model metadata classes together for simplicity of encoding. There are three metadata classes:

·      ObservationMetadata: Metadata about the whole timeseries observation;

·      TimeseriesMetadata: Metadata about the whole timeseries or individual regularly spaced segments of an irregularly spaced whole timeseries; and

·      PointMetadata: Metadata about individual points in the timeseries. PointMetadata may be set to a default across the whole timeseries and over-ridden for individual points.

   Multiplicity
   
	
  quality

  	
  This property is for specifying a
  quality assertion using the TimeseriesML 1.0
  defined concepts of quality as described in the DataQualityCode
  list. When a non-standard quality code is required a SWE Qualifier property
  shall be used.

  	
  DataQualityCode

  interpolationType

  	
  Defines the nature of the relationship
  between the time instant and the recorded value. For example, the value may
  represent an average across the time period since the last point (average in
  preceding interval). This value should be taken from the InterpolationCode
  list.

  The interpolation type is defined per
  point within the timeseries as it is possible for this to change mid series.
  Within the XML encoding it is possible to set a default interpolation for the
  series.

  placeholder for such textual information.

  	
  CharacterString

  	
  0..1

  	
 
	
  uncertainty

  	
  This property allows for a quantitative assertion of
  the estimated uncertainty of the measurement value. The term uncertainty is
  used here in line with 'measurement uncertainty' as defined in the
  International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM3,
  http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/vim.html), however it is acknowledged
  that it is still quite common practice (e.g., in instrument specifications)
  for the word accuracy to be used in place of uncertainty.

  	
  Quantity

  	
  0..1

  	
 
	
  relatedObservation

  	
  This property allows individual points
  to be associated with related observations. This is used when a timeseries

  CommentBlock

  	
  0..*

  
	
  temporalExtent

  	
  The extent of the temporal domain of
  the timeseries. As the domain of the timeseries is temporal, the temporalExtent is a time period defining the start and
  end of its temporal domain (i.e., the start and end of the timeseries). Note
  that this often the same as the phenomenon time as specified in the OM_Observation; it is still useful here for timeseries
  that are described separately from an OM_Observation
  header. 

  	
  TM_Period

  	
  0..1

  
	
  baseTime

  	
  Timeseries that are regularly spaced,
  such as those that are generated from automatic sensors, can be represented
  without specifying the individual time instant for each point. The spacing property of the timeseries is
  used to specify the time between points. This is then used as the spacing for
  each point encountered, starting from the time set by baseTime.

  	
  TM_Position

  	
  0..1

  
	
  intendedObservationSpacing

  	
  The extent of the temporal domain of
  the timeseries. As the domain of the timeseries is temporal, the temporalExtent is a time period defining the start and
  end of its temporal domain (i.e., the start and end of the timeseries). Note
  that this often the same as the phenomenon time as specified in the OM_Observation; it is still useful here for timeseries
  that are described separately from an OM_Observation
  header.

  	
  TM_Period

  	
  0..1

  
	
  cumulative

  	
  This boolean
  property indicates whether the series is sequentially increasing and
  accumulates over time; i.e., each value is added to the last
  so the value represents the total of a value since accumulation began.

  	
  Boolean

  	
  0..1

  
	
  accumulationAnchorTime

  	
  Defines the time at which accumulation
  begins. e.g., 9am.

  	
  TM_Period

  accumulation is recorded e.g., 24 hours

  	
  TM_PeriodDuration

  	
  0..1

  
	
  startAnchorPoint

  	
  StartAnchorPoint specifies a ‘ghost’ point to allow
  the first value of the timeseries to be interpolated correctly.

  	
  TM_Position

  	
  0..1

  
	
  endAnchorPoint

  	
  EndAnchorPoint specifies a ‘ghost’ point to allow
  the last value of the timeseries to be interpolated correctly.

  	
  TM_Position

  	
  0..1

  
	
  spacing

  	
  The time between points in a regularly
  spaced timeseries.

  	
  TM_PeriodDuration

  	
  0..1

  
	
  status

  	
  Indicates the statues of the
  observation. E.g., unreleased, verified etc. 

  	
  StatusCode

  sampledMedium

  	
  Indicates the medium that was sampled.
  E.g., water, air, etc. 

  	
  SampledMediumCode

  	
  0..1

  
	
  maxGapPeriod

  	
  When any analysis is run over a
  timeseries it is important to know if it is possible to interpolate between
  any two adjoining points. If the join period between two adjoining points is
  greater than the maxGapPeriod then the series
  should not be interpolated between these adjoining points. 

  	
  TM_PeriodDuration

  	
  0..1

  
	
  Parameter

  	
  This is a named value extension point
  that allows extra metadata to be added at the timeseries level. The parameters
  here are soft-typed (i.e., this standard does not define the properties
  semantics). Commonly used parameters here would be future candidates for
  definition within later versions or community extensions.

Annex B - Codelists (informative)

This annex contains copies of codelists that are initially defined in the OGC Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements and used in the TimeseriesML XML encoding.

They are reproduced in this standard for convenience only. The normative definitions are not maintained in this standard.

Normative definitions can be found at http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2 and are maintained outside of this specification.

B.1             DataQualityCode Codelist

Terms in this codelist are used to indicate the quality of individual data points.

   Code
   	
   Label
   	
   Definition
   
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/Continuous

  	
  Continuous 

  	
   A continuous timeseries indicates the
  observation result is the value of a property at the indicated instant in
  time. The points are essentially connected and
  interpolation may occur between points in order to estimate the value of the
  property between points. The appropriate time spacing between successive
  points to minimize interpolation errors is related to rate of change (with
  respect to time) of the property.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/Discontinuous

  	
  Discontinuous 

  	
   The sampling of the property occurs such
  that it is not possible to regard the series as continuous. The time between
  samples is too large to classify the measurements as continuous.

  Example: An infrequent water sample
  measuring pH.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/InstantTotal

  	
  Instant Total 

  	
   Value represents a total attributed to a
  specific time instant. This is normally generated from an event-based
  measuring device.

  Example: An individual tip of a
  tipping bucket rain gauge.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/AveragePrec

  Maximum Preceding 

  	
  Value represents the maximum value
  that was measured during the preceding time interval.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/MinPrec

  	
  Minimum Preceding

  	
  Value represents the minimum value
  that was measured during the preceding time interval.

  Preceding Total 

  	
  Value represents the total of
  measurements taken within the previous time interval.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/AverageSucc

  	
  Average Succeeding

  	
  Value represents the average value over
  the following interval.    

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/TotalSucc

  	
  Total Succeeding 

  	
  Value represents the average value
  over the following interval.

   Value represents the minimum value for the
  following interval.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/MaxSucc

  	
  Maximum Succeeding 

  	
  Value represents the maximum value for
  the following interval.

  
	
  http://opengis.net/def/timeseries/1.2/InterpolationCode/ConstPrec

  	
  Constant Preceding 

  	
  Value is constant in the preceding
  interval.

Annex C - Mapping of TimeseriesML 1.0 XML Schema types to WaterML2.0 XML Schema types (Normative)

This annex contains a mapping of the TimeseriesML1.0 XML Schema to the WaterML 2.0 XML Schema.

In the TimeseriesML XML Schema implementation emphasis has been placed on minimizing the number of classes. This has been achieved by a combination of soft typing and by merging classes where appropriate (e.g., ObservationMetadata and TimeseriesMetadata are merged in the Timeseries conceptual model).

  TimeseriesML 1.0 XML Schema
  	
  Notes
  
	
  TimePeriodList (in Version 1.2)

  	
  timeseriesDR.xsd

  	
  Previously,
  the TimeseriesML Domain-Range schema only allowed
  for a list of instantaneous time positions to be encoded under the gml:domainSet element (TimePositionList).

  An
  amendment to the timeseriesDR.xsd allows the encoding of
  a list of Time Periods, which contain both a beginning dateTime and an ending dateTime.
  This has been added primarily to denote an
  observation's valid time that spans a range in time. For example, a maximum
  temperature that is valid from 12Z
  to 00Z needs a valid time that is denoted by both a beginning and ending time. Ver1.2 contains this
  update.

  accommodate metadata applicable to an irregularly spaced whole timeseries for
  Domain- Range encoding, an amendment to increase the cardinality of timeseriesMetadata from "1" to
  "unbounded" has been added to timeseriesDR.xsd.

  The
  amendment allows for dividing the entire irregularly spaced timeseries with
  different time spacings into segments that do contain regularly spaced time
  steps. Metadata can then be used to describe each of these individual
  segments.

  The
  amendment also necessitates an update to the documentation of both timeseriesMetadata in timeseriesDR.xsd and its'
  child element TimeseriesMetadata in
  timeseriesMetadata.xsd to denote that metadata can be applied to the whole
  timeseries or individual regularly spaced segments of the whole irregularly
  spaced timeseries.
