i. Preface 

This document summarizes recommendations for extending geospatial standards with 
regard to time-varying information. These proposals are the result of the National 
Technology Alliance program called Temporal Evaluation and Assessment (TEA). The 
recommendations made are based upon the findings from the first two demonstrations of 
TEA. OGC has encouraged TEA to submit the results of the standard’s evaluation to the 
revision working groups for the various standards. These recommendations encompass 
several OGC specifications, WFS, WMS, CSW and OWS Common, but are contained 
within a single discussion paper for continuity. 

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 05-008]. In 
particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement 
to be strictly followed to conform to this specification.

Introduction 

In May 2005, Northrop Grumman began work on the TEA program for the National 
Technology Alliance. Working in conjunction with pertinent standards bodies (ISO, 
OGC, INCITS, and W3C) TEA has tested and demonstrated ways to manage and use 
time-varying geospatial information. TEA has enabled experimentation and collaboration 
with various government departments and industry to achieve the following. 

• Evaluate and test standards for capabilities and shortcomings. 

• Define data schemas and databases with temporal capabilities. 

• Develop a compliance engine that extends to temporal services. 

• Identify technology gaps and potential solutions. 

• Validate requirements for temporal capabilities and increase stakeholder participation 
from the intelligence community. 

• Deliver a persistent unclassified environment for evaluation, integration, and testing 
of standards, interfaces, software, and data. 

This document is one of the recommendations to standards changes resulting from 
research on TEA. 

After reviewing the changes to the OGC Filter Specification (05-093), Northrop 
Grumman TASC is submitting the following revisions. This is based upon work we are 
performing for the National Technology Alliance in studying temporal geospatial 
standards and interfaces (TEA project). TASC is supportive of modifying the filter 
specification for temporal and appreciates the change submittal. Please be aware that 
OGC is a stakeholder in the TEA project and we are also looking at recommendations to 
the OGC common specification to address temporal interfaces and data. 

These modifications specified other references to the temporal operators and clarified the 
use of time zones in temporal data.

2 Recommended Changes to the Web Feature Service Implementation and Filter 
Encoding Specifications 

These recommendations are based upon the addition of metadata for features with 
temporal information. Three types of temporal features were defined by the TEA research 
and are summarized below.  

 

1. Feature instance – a single instance of features (usually the most current) 
i. Currency timestamp – the date and time at which this feature 

became effective 
2. Feature history – a succession of revisions to a feature over time, to 

include past and future revisions. 
i. Revision – a unique sequential identifier (integer value) that 

defines the successive revision of features. 
ii. Valid time - real world time the change occurred (valid start time) 

and the change is no longer in effect (valid end time) 
iii. Transaction time - when the database was updated to reflect the 

change (transaction start time) and when the change is no longer in 
effect (transaction end time) 

3. Feature observation – a time series of observed values from an in-situ 
feature sensor. 

i. Observation type – an enumerated name of the type of report 
(example, temperature). 

ii. Time of observation 
iii. Value of observation

4. Moving Feature – a feature that changes location over time. The trajectory 
of a single moving feature contains. 

i. Time 
ii. Location 

iii. Other attributes as defined in ISO 19141 
 

The applicability of the WFS recommendations to the types of temporal features is shown 
in the table below. 

Type R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 

Instance √ √  √ √ 

History √ √ √ √ √ 

Observation √   √  

Moving Feature √   √  

 

The research on TEA has produced recommendations for feature instance and history. 
The observations and moving features have been prototyped and apply to some of the 
recommendations, but the implementation of these feature types are the subject of future 
recommendations. 

2.1 WFS recommendation 1 – Filter Encoding 

Change request 05-093 was submitted to the OGC WFS RWG by ORNL in October 
2005. NG TASC supports the change request with modification. The modifications 
specify other references to the temporal operators and clarify the use of time zones in 
temporal data. The modifications recommended to 05-093 have been submitted to the 
OGC as document number 05-093r1. 

2.2 WFS Recommendation 2 – Feature Instance and History 

Standard fields for representing feature instance (currency timestamp) and feature history 
(revision, valid time and transaction time) should be added as an optional implementation 
of the feature metadata. When applications implement temporal features, these standard 
fields can be referenced by applications using WFS in filtering and status reporting of 
features. This recommendation will be made in concert with the ISO Geographic 
information metadata specification, ISO 19115. 

The intent of this change is to add metadata to the capabilities indicating that a 
featureType has standard temporal properties, as defined by ISO 19115.  For instance, it 
should indicate that featureType A contains “feature instances” and has a property which 
represents the currency timestamp. The metadata referenced are elements of a feature 
type, such as contained in Table 6 of the WFS 1.1 specification. Just as 



OGC 06-022r1 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 3
 

LatLongBoundingBox and SRS are standard elements of a featureType, we proposed that 
temporal extent, temporal reference system and temporal type become standard elements. 
Some metadata elements contained in ISO 19115 (see appendix B.1), such as metadata 
items dataExt and RefSys, can be used to define temporal metadata in the WFS. The 
discovery of the temporal information would be accomplished through recommendation 
WFS-R4. 

2.3 WFS Recommendation 3 – History Transaction 

A WFS transaction for storing feature history is needed. The current WFS transaction is 
capable of only updating a single instance of a feature. The feature history transaction 
prototyped by TEA stores the revision number, valid time and transaction time for each 
revision to a feature. A web feature transaction to update features history for insert, 
modify and withdraw (remove) operations is recommended. The proposal 05-039 for 
fine-grained object updates may be applied to this type of transaction. A comment from 
Galdos on this recommendation: 

“We agree that there is a need for Update to be able to change a single TimeSlice 
and NOT the entire feature.  We are working on a proposal for this under the fine 
grained object update change proposal.  Dynamic features (with histories) are a 
primary use case for this work.  In the case of the SnapShot model there are no 
TimeSlices organized by a history property. Each SnapShot of the feature has a 
time associated with it.  This likely requires changes to WFS – so that one can 
update the different SnapShots. I think your proposal seems more related to this 
case than the history case.” 

2.4 WFS Recommendation 4 – Temporal Extent 

In order for clients to determine if a feature type has temporal information (feature 
instance and feature history), WFS should inform the client of the temporal data within 
the layer, similar to the WMS. The feature capabilities document needs to contain the 
temporal extent of the feature data within the layer. If the feature type has temporal 
attributes, the WFS GetCapabilities operation should return the temporal extent (start, 
end, frequency) of the feature type similar to the way time is incorporated into the 
bounding box of WMS GetCapabilites.  

One method of implementing this recommendation is to have a new interface called 
GetTemporalExtent to complement GetCapabilities.  There would be two components to 
the interface: GetCapabilities has an element that indicates the temporal type (instance, 
history, observation, moving feature) of each feature type; GetTemporalExtent returns the 
temporal extent for feature types as selected by filters on feature type and bounding box. 
For example, this interface can be used to know a navigation aids feature type has 
features surrounding the Chicago area with history from 2001-01-01 to 2005-12-31. An 
alternative to GetTemporalExtent implementation would use GetFeature with a value for 
the resultType parameter called temporal.

2.5 WFS Recommendation 5 – Temporal Key Value Pair (KVP) 

For feature instance and feature history layers, a recommendation is made to implement a 
time key name/value pair (KVP) to account for the various times associated with features 
in a HTTP GetFeature request, similar to the TIME parameter in the WMS specification 
for GetMap. This would enable specific temporal feature queries using a key name/value 
pair without using the XML filter. The TIME parameter would query feature instance 
layers on the currency timestamp. The TIME parameter would query feature history 
layers on the valid start timestamp. For example, to query a point feature within a range 
of time would be a much simpler with this interface than building a XML filter. 

For example, if the most recent feature within a time interval was needed, the following 
request could be implemented with a TIME parameter.  

GetFeature typename=”XYZ” TIME=”start time/end time” 

This would return a feature if current within the time range; for a feature history, it would 
return all features within the period.  

If the feature had a specific instance date, this could be done with TIME (a temporary 
feature would be a good example). 

GetFeature typename=”XYZ” TIME=”start date” 

Note: It may be preferable to have a different TIME parameter for instances and history, 
such as TIMEINSTANCE, TIMERANGE and TIMESLICE.  

These examples illustrate the simplicity of temporal feature queries vs. the longer filter 
query, which would still be used for more complex queries. 

If the temporal KVP recommendation has use outside of WFS, then this recommendation 
should be implemented in OWS Common specification. 

3 Web Maps Service Recommendation – Temporal Map Layer Metadata 

 The web map service has an optional TIME attribute associated with each image served 
and a temporal extent for each layer in the capability document. This is useful 
information for temporal analysis, but only provides a range of time and frequency for 
which maps (images) exist. Clients that need to browse for specific images have to 
perform a GetMap request for each time of interest, which is a cumbersome and 
inefficient process.  The GetCapabilities or another operation should be capable of 
returning a list of images for a specified layer with metadata for each map, and optionally 
a thumbnail of the map, for all maps within a given time range.  

The time information can be implemented with a new interface such as 
GetTemporalMaps or modifying an existing interface. The WMS interface has a 
mechanism to provide this information if it were extended. Using properties of the 
temporal extent (called dimension in WMS 1.3), the Capabilities document can provide a 



OGC 06-022r1 

Copyright © 2006 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 5
 

list of times with maps. The “time” extent (dimeinsion) in WMS could return multiple 
values instead of a period. 

A portion of GetCapabilities would currently return this metadata: 

<Dimension name="time" nearestValue="0" multipleValues="0" 
current="0">2002-12-01/2005-09-01</Extent>

A temporal extension of WMS could return this metadata: 

<Dimension name="time" nearestValue="0" multipleValues="1" 
current="0">2002-12-01,2002-12-02, 2002-12-03, 2002-12-06, …. 

….

2005,08,31,2005-09-01</Extent>

 

Note the gap in coverage between 2002-12-03 and 2002-12-06. This data is not available 
in the current WMS GetCapabilities. 

It is permissible to specify the specific times supported by listing multiple values in the 
extent string (but a specific request for this format is needed). However, a better 
structured format for returning the values would be helpful, since the string can get 
unmanageable if you support a large number of images collected at irregular times, so 
structuring the Dimension element or adding a GetTemporalExtent operation would be in 
order. 

The enables the WMS interface (using GetTemporalMaps or GetCapabilities) to provide 
a list of times with maps. With this information, the client could perform a GetMap to 
retrieve the map on a specific date. A thumbnail view of maps could be implemented 
with GetTemporalMaps and GetMap with a new FORMAT. For example, 
FORMAT=text/html might create an HTML page showing thumbnails, or 
FORMAT=mpeg might create a mpeg video with each frame representing a different 
time. 

The capability desired in WMS is analogous to WCS which has a TemporalDomain to 
describe the valid time constraints for GetCoverage requests (WCS 1.0, section 8.3.2.3). 
In WCS GetCoverage, the TemporalDomain can contain a sequence of time instants and/ 
or time periods. A harmonization between WMS and WCS could define the same 
interface for temporal extent. 

4 Catalogue Service – Web (CSW) 

4.1 CSW-Recommendation 1 - Harvest Temporal WFS Information 

The catalogue data model needs an extension to support time in harvesting the WFS 
capabilities document to store the temporal extent of each layer in the catalogue registry. 



OGC 06-022r1

4.2 CSW-Recommendation 2 - Data Elements 

The Describe Record operation does not provide all the hierarchical data elements, 
including named slots, which makes it difficult to determine which records have temporal 
data, when to extend the ebRIM model to add data elements, and how to build queries on 
these records. Therefore, the Describe Record operation should have the option to return 
all data elements for a given record type. The result of this recommendation will ensure 
this limitation is not unique to a particular Web Registry Service (WRS) implementation. 
 

5 OWS Common Recommendation 1 - Time Zone Offset Request 

The Time Zone for temporal data is not standard in data sources but knowledge of the 
time zone is necessary for consistent queries and unambiguous results, especially queries 
that encompass data from multiple time zones or filter by the hour, minute or second. 
Web services should have a default time zone of UTC as defined by ISO 8601 (or 
Greenwich Mean Time, also referred to as “Z” for Zulu Time) for all temporal data 
passed or returned. ISO 8601 accounts for local time by specifying an offset to UTC. 
Web services should allow the client to request a time zone offset to be applied to all 
temporal data through a parameter passed on operations. For example, if the client 
requested all data referenced in U.S. eastern time zone, a time zone offset of  -0500 (five 
hours) from UTC would be applied to all temporal fields. The web service must able to 
convert and return temporal data values from the time zone of the data to the specified 
time offset given in the request.
