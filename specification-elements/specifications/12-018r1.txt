Preface 

This report describes the methods, results, issues and recommendations generated by 
the Surface Water Interoperability Experiment (SW IE), carried out as an activity of the 
OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG). The SW IE was designed to 
advance the development of WaterML 2.0 and test its use with various OGC service 
standards (SOS, WFS, WMS and CSW). A secondary aim was to contribute to the 
development of a hydrology domain feature model and vocabularies, which are 
essential for interoperability in the hydrology domain, although these are not the main 
focus for the IE.  

Suggested additions, changes, and comments on this report are welcome and 
encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message or by making 
suggested changes in an edited copy of this document.

1 INTRODUCTION 

This report describes the methods, results, issues and recommendations generated by 
the Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment (SW IE), carried out as an activity of the 
OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG). The SW IE was designed to 
advance the development of WaterML 2.0 and test its use with various OGC service 
standards (SOS, WFS, WMS and CSW). A secondary aim was to contribute to the 
development of a hydrology domain feature model and vocabularies, which are 
essential for interoperability in the hydrology domain, although these are not the main 
focus for the IE.  

The use of O&M compliant WaterML 2.0 and OGC web services for data exchange 
will allow for easier access to and consistent interpretation of water data. The ultimate 
use of this data will depend on the context of participating organizations and their 
driving requirements.  

Surface water datasets typically contain a large number of observations at a small 
number of locations, which has tested WaterML 2.0 in new ways. This contrasts and 
complements the first HSWG Groundwater IE, in which for groundwater observations, 
there are typically small in number, taken at many locations.

1.3 Future work 

Future improvements to this document are desirable to clarify technical details arising 
from subsequent implementation of OGC standards and related technologies. In 
particular the finalization of SOS2.0 has occurred during the writing of this report and 
needs to be more fully tested with WaterML 2.0 as only some aspects were tested 
during this IE. 

Aspects of the SW IE will continue informally amongst participants interested in 
maintaining and expanding surfacewater data sharing.

5 SWIE OVERVIEW 

5.1 Background 

The Surfacewater IE takes place as an experiment conducted by the OGC Hydrology 
Domain Working group as part of its efforts to advance interoperability with hydrology 
domain application of OGC standards. It is the second experiment conducted by the 
working group, following the Ground Water IE.  

The experiment is limited in scope to surface water flow observations. The reason for 
this is that timeseries of flow observations are typical of a broader range of in-situ 
hydrological observations such as turbidity, electrical conductivity and are very 
common in the hydrology domain. This allowed the experiment to focus on ensuring 
that the characteristics of those timeseries are tested for suitability with WaterML 2.0, 
without making excessive demands on data providers and limiting unnecessary 
complexity. 

5.2 Motivation and Goals 

This interoperability experiment will advance the development of WaterML 2.0, test its 
use with various OGC service standards (SOS, WFS, WMS and CSW) and emerging 
clients. 
 
Objectives 

The aim of this IE was to: 
(1) Extend and complement the work already underway in IE 1, with the goal of 
advancing the development of WaterML 2.0 to the sub domain of surface water 
observations. 
(2) Test compatibility of WaterML 2.0 with existing IOW-Sandre, DLZ-IT BMVBS, 
CUAHSI and USGS services and with implementation of the OGC SOS, WFS, WMS 
standards; 
(3) Advance exchange of surface water data between Germany and France in the cross-
border area of the Rhine/Rhin river, such that participants can dynamically and 
transparently access the data and utilize it with their respective information systems.  
(4) Test compatibility of WaterML 2.0 for use with hydrological forecasting systems. 
(5) Establish a limited surface water feature model and vocabularies suitable for the 
provision of surface water data using WaterML 2.0. 
(6) The data will be served by all participants using WaterML 2.0 and OGC services 
(SOS, WFS, WMS). 
 
The experiment was conducted as a set of 3 use cases. The use cases were:

1. Cross Border Data Exchange Use Case: In this use case the user will discover 
surface water data from cross border or other regions via web map client and 
then visualize the time-series. Once the data has been inspected and the user is 
satisfied that the data is of interest, the user will download the data in an 
appropriate format. 

2. Forecasting Use Case: The user will discover and download data suitable for a 
streamflow forecast. The user will be able to feed a streamflow forecast model 
with this data, but the modeling itself is not part of the scope of this IE. 

3. Global Runoff Use Case: The goal for this use case is to provide automated 
monthly and yearly volume calculations from large rivers discharging to the 
oceans.  Due to slower than expected progress, the use case was amended to a 
simple to a use case very similar to use case 1, in which data from the GRDC 
was made available using WaterML 2.0.  

The original activity plan use cases can be seen in Appendix 2. 

5.3 Structure of Report. 

The following section reports on the use cases of the experiment, each of which is 
broken down into a list of use case contributors, use case description and goal, followed 
by a description of the implementation followed by the results in the form of 
recommendations for best practice and conclusions. This section is followed a report on 
the clients developed as part of the experiment. This allows the findings of the client 
implementation reported on separately which has been done, as there was considerable 
interest in the development of clients as part of the IE.

6.2 Introduction 

The purpose of use case 1 was to test WaterML 2.0 by disseminating surfacewater flow 
observations of the river Rhine (French: Rhin – German: Rhein) between Germany, the 
Netherlands and France, to all participants using OGC SOS, WFS and WMS web 
services. An additional aim was the demonstration of cross border surface water data 
interoperability in a field with different administrational responsibilities with expected 
multilingual issues. 

For the use case, data from France and Germany was to be displayed in a single client, 
with data services from the respective jurisdictions. The targeted clients were the web 
client from 52north and the WISKI client. The proposed SOS implementations were the 
SOS server from 52north and the SOS server component of the KiWIS package. 

6.3 Motivation and Goals  

The cross-border experiment has the following objectives: 

(1) Advancing the development of WaterML 2.0 to the sub domain of surface water 
observations. 

(2) Test compatibility of WaterML 2.0 with existing IOW-Sandre, DLZ-IT services 
and with implementation of the OGC SOS, WFS and WMS standards. 

(3) Advance exchange of surface water data between Germany and France in the 
crossborder area of the river Rhine, such that participants can dynamically and 
transparently access the data and utilize it with their respective information 
systems. 

6.4 Design and Implementation

The setup of the cross border experiment included several server implementations of 
WaterML2.0 using SOS, WFS and WMS as well as clients able to consume 
WaterML2.0 data. 

A schematic overview of technology and data sources as well as the role of the 
participants is shown in the figure below. Initially the experiment planned to use a 
simple setup with service endpoints known to the participants (see SOS implementation 
in figure). Later in the experiment it was planned to use catalogue services (see CSW 
implementation in figure) for the service and data discovery.

6.5 Results - outstanding issues 

Unfortunately as the experiment progressed, supply of data from the necessary 
institutions to support the IE became a problem. On the French side this lack of data 
made it nearly impossible to set up an infrastructure, which could be used for the IE. In 
addition, the German data source is only providing the last four weeks of observation 
data. As well, only data for some stations in other catchment areas were available late 
in the experiment, so that a combined view on the data would have been quite 
meaningless. 

The problem of missing data from one of the participants was not due to the lack of 
willingness to contribute to the IE, but on problems with the exchange of data between 
two different agencies within France.  

Another issue, which delayed the implementation of a real-time or near real-time data 
exchange, was the fact, that the central database of the French hydrological service was 
undergoing a major redesign.

For further interoperability experiments it should be considered to have a reasonably 
good knowledge of the existing and accessible data.  

The other issue experienced concerns the rapid development of the underlying 
specifications SOS 2.0 and WaterML 2.0. Due to the frequent changes in these two 
specifications, the ability of the software providers to implement and provide 
consolidated implementations of client and server where very limited. 

6.6 Recommendations: 

Due to the organizational difficulties related to data availability experienced during this 
use case, it is recommended that for future experiments, contributors, put time into to 
identifying these organizational barriers as risks, and develop appropriate risk 
management strategies. 

R1: Future experiments, contributors, put time into to identifying organizational 
barriers as risks to experiments, and develop appropriate risk management 
strategies.

7 USE CASE 2 - FORECASTING

7.2 Introduction 

This use case looks at the suitability of WaterML 2.0 encoding, delivered using SOS, 
for incremental feeds of hydrological (time series) data, in real time, from known data 
sources, to hydrological forecasting systems. This experiment will not address the 
delivery of hydrological forecasts via an SOS, as this evaluation is foreseen for the 
follow on interoperability experiment focused on Hydrological Forecasting. 

7.3 Motivation and Goals 

Hydrologic forecasting applications are real time system applications that continuously 
need to be aware of the latest state of the water and weather systems. Their data feed 
process is characterized by a incremental data ingest occurring at relative high 
frequency (1-15 minutes). The record lengths of data transmitted are typically small 
(i.e. one or a few values per observation). However, given the real time aspect of these 
systems with high frequency update requirements, they need to be efficient with their 
data feed as well. This places different requirements on the data encoding and services 
compared to the other use cases. 

These requirements are characterized by the high-frequent exchange of data increments 
from a known set of monitoring points for a known set of phenomena. The exchange 
needs to be fast, so that it disrupts the forecast system as little as possible. Data 
discovery is typically not relevant in this context, and meta-data therefore, should be 
kept to a minimum to reduce the payload and parsing time. 

The goal of this use case is to evaluate the suitability of SOS and the WaterML 2.0 
encoding to support high-performance forecasting systems with high frequency, 
incremental observational data updates. In this evaluation, a comparison is made 
against other standardized file formats that are commonly used to exchange 
hydrometeorologic time series for forecasting purposes: 

7.4 Design and Implementation 

To assess the performance of WaterML 2.0 encoded files, a comparison is made against 
other standardized file formats that are commonly used to exchange hydrometeorologic 
time series for forecasting: 

 SHEF: The US - Standard Hydrometeorological Exchange Format

 PI-xml: the Published Interface format from the Delft-Flood Early 
Warning System 

The following evaluation criteria have been applied: 

 ingest time 

 file size (compressed/uncompressed) as a proxy for network transportation 

The SOS 2.0 service used to deliver the data was hosted by USGS 
(http://http://nwisvaws02.er.usgs.gov/ogc-swie/). Some other tests have been done with 
a SOS 1.0 service using SWE Common encoding, hosted by 52North. 

Deltares implemented the SOS client in the Delft-FEWS software platform. The test 
application was the NCRFC-CHPS (North Central River Forecasting Center's 
implementation of the Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS)). 

Ingest time was evaluated from the moment of receiving the SOS-response message to 
the internal data commit for WaterML2 encoded data. From this data set, a set of SHEF 
and PI-xml files were created and posted to the local disk. These files were then read 
from disk. For these two formats, ingest time was calculated from the start of file read

7.5 Results – outstanding issues 

Having a clear and shared agreement on the SOS-profile is essential for forecasting 
systems, as these applications are not designed to discover data or figure out by 
themselves how to query a service. Their purpose is to bring in the data as fast as 
possible. While FeatureOfInterest and ObservedProperty are rather clear, the use of 
Offerings and Procedures leaves too much room for mixing one and the other. 

Metadata is burdening the performance of xml-encoded WaterML2 messages in high-
frequent incremental data exchange. The overhead in a WaterML2 encoded message is 
5-10 times the overhead in SHEF and PI-formats. This is reflected both in message size 
as well as ingest time. The relative overhead shrinks with longer timeseries, but those 
are not typical within a forecasting context. Reduction of nested data structure 
complexity is likely to contribute to better performance.  It is recognized that both 
SHEF and PI-xml are highly optimized formats for specific data and uses, and we can 
expect them to out perform a generalized data format such as WaterML 2.0 and how 
efficient WaterML 2.0 needs to be for forecasting applications remains an open 
question. There are a number of options available to assess; profiling WaterML 2.0 in a 
“simple profile” which limits the amount of metadata transmitted, binary xml encoding 
such as FastInfoset (FI) and full xml compression using gzip or similar. 

NWS and USGS use different identifiers for the same stations. An Identification 
Mapping service (ID Mapping) would be highly desirable to accommodate the mixed 
usage of station identifiers from either organization (and others).

7.6 Recommendations 

7.6.1 Services Profile 

SWIE-compliant SOS-services need to be clear on the interpretation of the terms 
'Offering' and 'Procedure'. Currently too much variation exists between services that 

.  use these items

This issue is dealt with in detail in use case 3. 

One of the other issues which arose during the IE was the concurrent development of 
SOS 2.0. WaterML 2.0 is a specialization of O&M 2.0 which itself requires GML 
3.2. The recommendation therefore is to use SOS 1.0 for the SWIE. This 
recommendation is located in 9.3 SWIE SOS hydrology profile. 

7.6.2 Issues and Recommendations 

R2: Any reduction of metadata transmission will be beneficial for incremental 
high frequency data exchange. 

R3: Additional research will be needed to evaluate to assess if binary encodings 
can overcome some of the poor performance problems from WaterML2 in full 
xml-encoding.

Table 2: Contributors for Use Case 3. 

8.2 Introduction 

The original plan for this use case was to provide calculated monthly and yearly volume 
discharge estimates from a few large rivers discharging to the oceans. This was an ambitious 
plan in which processing tasks were to be included as part of a workflow that would totalize the 
discharge measurement for a selected year and then display aggregated values.  Candidate 
locations for the experiment were to be selected from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) 
database.  

The plan was adjusted during the experiment s a result of the slower than expected progress due 
to the difficulties with developing services concurrently with the WaterML2.0 development. 
The original plan for this use case can be seen in Appendix 2. 

8.3 Motivation and Goals  

The goal of the use case was adjusted to two tasks: 

(1) to make data from the GTN-R Station network provided by Global Runoff Data 
Center available using WaterML2 and SOS and 

(2)  to enable the GRDC to ingest data from the USGS (Mississippi Area) using 
WaterML2 and SOS. 

8.4 Design and Implementation 

The implementation was based on establishing an instance of the KISTERS 
WISKI/KiTSM to provide the underlying data repository for the GRDC data. This was 
setup by KISTERS within the KISTERS DMZ for the purpose of the experiment. 

The GRDC data was migrated into this data management system but required some 
modification to support delivery by WaterML2.0. The data extended include gauge 
name and WMO gauge identifier, country the gauge is in, the time zone information 
and spatial references as well as the WMO catchment name and associated size.

On top of the WISKI/KiTSM system the KISTERS Interoperability Solution KiWIS 
provided the support for SOS/WaterML2.0 (http://kiwis.kisters.de).  

The WISKI Desktop application was also extended to consume metadata and time 
series data through new SOS consumer classes. For this use case a dedicated consumer 
class has been developed to ingest data from the USGS NWIS Services  which can be 
found at http://nwisvaws02.er.usgs.gov/ogc-swie/. 

The diagram below shows the architecture of the system for use case 3.

8.5 USGS SOS Services 

The experimental WaterML 2.0 service created by the United States Geological Survey 
(USGS) provided runoff data from the Mississippi to GRDC. USGS had an additional 
goal to evaluate how feasible it would be to serve hydrological time series data from the 
entire United States using WaterML 2.0.  

This service was built to deliver WaterML2.0 using initially SOS1.0 as required by 
SWIE. It was able to offer a GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, GetDataAvailablity, and 
GetObservation output for all of the real-time water data that is available in the USGS 
National Water Information System (NWIS), as well as historic daily data.  Discharge, 
gage height, temperature, precipitation, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and pH were the 
properties that were specifically tested, although all properties are available using a 5-
digit parameter code.  A very elementary WebFeatureService (wfs) was also 
provided.  GetObservation data using WaterML 2.0 was the main output being 
investigated.  The service is available here: http://nwisvaws02.er.usgs.gov/ogc-swie/.  It 
will continue to evolve with the changing WaterML 2.0 requirements. 
 
8.6 USGS SOS Service Results

During the Surface Water Interoperability Experiment (SWIE), the experiences of 
creating and using this service contributed to a number of changes made in the 
WaterML 2.0 requirements.  For example, there were several fields in the WaterML 2.0 
specification document that had very limited output options.  These were typically not 
appropriate for USGS needs (there are certain qualifiers and phrases that must be 
included in USGS data by law).   

Another outcome of the creating the test service was to analyze how WaterML 2.0 
could handle non-standard cases.  Multiple sensors at a single location, variable depths, 
and unique conditions (ice, adjusted values, etc.) were found and discussed within the 
WaterML 2.0 standards working group. 

An additional important aspect of the USGS service was dealing with huge amounts of 
data.  Aside from simply serving WaterML2 time series data, we attempted to provide a 
complete SOS 2.0 service.  A requirement for SOS 2.0 is a complete GetCapabilities 
document.  This document should theoretically give information about all of the 
possible offerings of the service.  Since the USGS service covers the entire United 
States, there was no way to include all of that information.  We followed the general 
guidelines developed by Kisters using their SOS Type C implementation described 
above.  Using the Type C implementation made it possible to provide a complete SOS 
service, but we still found the data discovery to be lacking.  Eventually we 
implemented a SOS 2.0 optional extension called GetDataAvailability.  This was a very 
useful and powerful extension.  A user can request information on featureID’s, 
properties, offerings, and time periods.  For example, a user could ask what featureID’s 
have certain unique properties and/or offerings during a specific time period.  Another 
example might be what properties are measured at a certain featureID and over what 
time period.

9 RESULTS AND  OUTSTANDING ISSUES 

The IE has contributed to the goal of further advancing WaterML2.0, which was the 
primary objective. The project teams have worked closely with the WaterML2.0 design 
team relating experiences that could be included into the design considerations. As 
indicated earlier, this has been both advantageous – being able to quickly react to issues 
as they arose, but also a hindrance, as the services relied on having a relatively fixed 
standard to work with. 

9.1 SOS Version 

As SOS 2.0 is still under development a decision was made to use SOS 1.0 which 
specifies the use of GML3.1.1, despite WaterML2.0 requiring GML3.2. This was 
reported on in 7.6.1.   

The USGS was able to build a prototype SOS2.0 service during the experiment, and 
some experience with WaterML2.0 and SOS2.0 was obtained. 

Further investigation is needed on the compatibility of the SOS1.0 and SOS2.0 
implementations. 

9.2 SOS Usage 

The SOS 1 specification requires that the list of features-of-interest be explicitly 
serialized in the GetCapabilities document. This list is either used for discovery 
(harvesting by catalog) or to provide a valid list of feature identifiers to be used in 
GetObservation (the feature-of-interest id being one of the parameters of this 
operation). 
The SOS 2 draft specification includes a relatedFeature property for the observation(no 
more information is provided, beside the property cardinality in Table 17 of OGC 10-
037), which seems to play a slightly more restricted role.  
The Capabilities document of SOS 2.0 lists related features instead of all features-of-
interest. The related features are selected by the service provider and serve discovery 
purposes. 
In the current WaterML2 model, it has been decided that the feature-of-interest should 
be constrained to a WaterML2.0 sampling feature and some systems can contain large 
quantities of features-of-interest, so it is impractical for performance reasons to 
serialize them individually.   
Nonetheless, the service is still required to publish a collection of feature-of-interest 
that can be used in GetObservation requests to extract observations related to a specific 
feature-of-interest. 

Proposed Solution  

We propose that the profile element SOS2.0 be formally part of the SOS specification. 
The capabilities document should be allowed to provide a composite feature as feature-
of-interest. The composite feature shall be a gml:FeatureCollection nesting other 
gml:FeatureCollections. The collection would be composed of a list of sub-collections. 



OpenGIS® Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment Final Report * 

 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 17 
 

If the sub-collection contains a reasonable amount of features-of-interest, the list would 
be serialized explicitly; otherwise the composite feature is serialized. The nesting logic 
within collections is up to the server. It can follow a purely geometric partitioning (e.g. 
quad-tree) or follow an administrative structure (state/county/city/zip).  
 

9.3 SWIE SOS Hydrology Profile 

9.3.1 Overview 

Experience with the existing SOS services shows that there is a range of ways to 
understand the generic SOS terminology. In different domain implementation areas 
the SOS standards have been interpreted differently and this has led to different 
implementations. These different SOS implementations cause ambiguous 
client/server interactions that are syntactically correct but create a semantically 
incorrect request/response patterns.  
 
To ensure consistent interpretation a common process of development or 
“alignment” is required typical of which you will find in an OGC IE. 
 
This is because SOS (and many other OGC standards) is an abstract specification 
designed to support a broad range of use cases ranging from fixed in-situ sensors to 
tracking applications or even complex remote sensing systems. Thus, flexibility is 
absolutely necessary to accomplish this. It is therefore up to the application domain 
to specialise the abstract standards suitable for implementation. 
In this chapter we therefore propose a specialisation of SOS usage (with respect to 
the WaterML2 proposal) – a profile for use in the IE. It should be seen as a “SOS 
Usage Profile for the Hydrology Domain” to which data providers and data 
consumer in the hydrological world can agree and comply with their software 
systems. This is necessary because just “SOS compliance” will not ensure that the 
client knows how the specific server understands the main SOS terms (“procedure”, 
“observed property”, “feature of interest”, “offering”). 
 
It is worth noting that this profile has been developed using SOS 1.0 and will 
possibly need to be extended or adjusted for use by SOS 2.0. 

9.3.2 Definitions 

General definitions as taken from the SOS 1.0 and O&M 1.0 specification 
documents: 
 
Observation Offering: 
An observation offering is a logical grouping of observations offered by a service 
that are related in some way. The parameters that constrain the offering should be 



OpenGIS® Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment Final Report * 

 

 
18 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 

defined in such as way that the offering is 'dense' in the sense that requests for 
observations that are within the specified parameters should be unlikely to result in 
an empty set. 
 
Procedure: 
Method, algorithm or instrument. (O&M: ...which is often an instrument or sensor 
but may be a process chain, human observer, an algorithm, a computation or 
simulator.) 
ObservedProperty: 
The observedProperty identifies or describes the phenomenon for which the 
observation result provides an estimate of its value. It must be a property associated 
with the type of the feature of interest. 
 
FeatureOfInterest: 
The featureOfInterest is a feature of any type (ISO 19109, ISO 19101), which is a 
representation of the observation target, being the real-world object regarding which 
the observation is made. 

9.3.3 Analysis 

This section contains the analysis of different SOS types that have been 
implemented in different domains. The objective is to try and assess which type is 
better suited to the needs of the hydrology domain. 

1. SOS Server Type A (procedure == sensor-type) 
 
A SOS service which serves more than raw data or medium/larger networks should 
use the following structure for the getCapabilities response – A procedure is seen as 
a sensor-type (==time-series type) and NOT as a sensor instance (==time-series 
instance). This structure should be homogenously used and not be used with other 
encodings. 
Example: 
http://kiwis.kisters.de/KiWIS/KiWIS?service=SOS&request=getCapabilities&datas
ource=0 
 
2. SOS Server Type B (procedure == sensor-instance) 
 
A SOS service which is a bit more as originally intended by SOS specification 
should use the following structure for the getCapabilities response - A procedure is 
seen as a sensor-instance (==complete identification of a single timeseries) . This 
structure encodes a path into the procedure field but allows inconsistent requests 
with features and properties. 
Example: 
http://kiwis.kisters.de/KiWIS/KiWIS?service=SOS&request=getCapabilities&datas
ource=1 



OpenGIS® Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment Final Report *

3. SOS Server Type C (procedure==sensor-type/system) 
 
A SOS as intended by the GroundWater IE should use the following structure for the 
getCapabilities response - A procedure is seen as a sensor-type or system. This 
structure requires additional requests or knowledge to “drill” into the data if you 
want to do it by sensor instance. Also refer to:

ionSensorDiscussion) 
Example: 
http://kiwis.kisters.de/KiWIS/KiWIS?service=SOS&request=getCapabilities&datas
ource=2 
 
4. SOS Server Type D “MIXED” (procedure==sensor-instance AND derived 
timeseries type) 
 
In addition to all types above there is also the option to use everything together in a 
“MIXED” way. A procedure is seen as a sensor-instance or a derived timeseries 
type. In this way actual sensor timeseries and derived timeseries can be 
distinguished. There is one procedure, one relatedFeature and one observedProperty 
per offering as long as there are different properties. This is a clear language but it 
results in very large getCapabilities documents. 
 
Also refer to: 
https://wiki.csiro.au/confluence/display/WaterML20/Adapting+to+SOS+(2.0) 
 
With reference to tables in Appendix 1, which describe the size of a GetCapabilities 
document for the different implementation options, we find that the document size 
consists of: 

- A couple of lines for the ServiceIdentification / ServiceProvider sections 
- Variable lines depending on the amount of FOI 
- Variable lines for Procedure 
- A rough estimate of 55-75 Bytes per line 

 
It was found that, depending on the SOS service type, the size is document size 
grows exponentially. At the HydroDWG workshop on Sept, 21st 2010, at the 
Toulouse TC, it was sensibly decided that the GetCapabilities document for the IE 



OpenGIS® Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment Final Report * 

 

 
20 Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 

should be a quick handshake document and not a full listing of database content (that 
just excludes the time-series values and some metadata from the full description).  
The consequence of this was that only the network itself was advertised, with the 
clients then required to further query the SOS with GetFeatureOfInterest calls with a 
filter query specification to return the sampling points of interest. This approach is 
practical but semantically inconsistent as the feature of interest changes from the 
network in GetCapabilities to SamplingPoints in the GetFeatureOfInterest. 
 
9.3.4 Recommendation 

Based on discussions held as part of the IE and the above analysis there are several 
problems that have to addressed to achieve interoperability. The biggest discrepancy 
lies with the interpretation of the normative definitions of O&M (for example, what 
is the featureofinterest)  

Most database and timeseries management system architectures require a unique 
identification of timeseries which in SOS must be accomplished by suitable mapping 
between system definitions of this information items and O&M. 
Further issues include that the SOS definition by default allows large bulk requests 
for data (e.g. complete data of all timeseries for one property) and the usage of the 
featureOfInterest in form of a real world feature like a river does not enable you to 
request data of a specific station, which requires some constraint of the feature of 
interest. 
 
Therefore the following set of rules has been agreed on to provide an interoperable 
SOS profile for the SurfaceWaterIE 
 

9.3.5 SWIE WaterML 2 Profile 

1. SWIE-compliant SOS services shall use the SOS 1.0 specification, even if the 
resulting Observation collection is GML 3.2. 
 

2. SWIE-compliant SOS services shall use the procedure as sensor or algorithm 
type like described in Type C, not as instance.  
 

3. SWIE-compliant SOS services shall use the featureOfInterest as 
samplingFeature in the sense of a site or station, not as the actual observed 
object (e.g. a river). This is consistent with WaterML2.0. 
 

4. SWIE-compliant SOS services shall use a global featureOfInterest in the 
GetCapabilities document and not list all existing samplingFeatures. 
 

5. SWIE-compliant SOS services shall use a mandatory GetFeatureOfInterest 
request to identify actual samplingFeatures either by filters or as complete list 
based on the global featureOfInterst. 
 



OpenGIS® Surfacewater Interoperability Experiment Final Report * 

 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. 21 
 

6. SWIE-compliant SOS services shall use a GetObservation request that either 
answers the full amount of data requested, or with an appropriate error message 
if the service provider wants to prevent large bulk requests. 
 

7. SWIE Should use the profile element in SOS2 to announce a SWIE/Type C 
SOS

10 SW IE CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION  

10.1 DelftFEWS SOS Client – Deltares 

10.1.1  Motivation and goals 

As a major supplier of forecasting system applications based on its Delft-FEWS software 
platform, Deltares would like to contribute to a WaterML2 standard that is suitable for 
hydrologic forecasting. As such the first step is to evaluate the suitability of SOS-services 
and WaterML2 encodings as a data feed to a forecasting system.  

To enable this evaluation, Deltares implemented a SOS client in the Delft-FEWS software 
platform. The test application was the NCRFC-CHPS (North Central River Forecasting 
Center's application of the Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS)). 

10.1.2  Design and Implementation 

Forecasting agencies rely on data feeds they trust. These data feeds change infrequently,  
data discovery needs are infrequent and often require action by the user (i.e. configuration). 
Given this context, Delft-FEWS requires the customization of the SOS client to query a 
specific SOS-service for the observations within a moving time window for a specific set of 
features of interest, observed property(s) and, if required by the service, offering and 
procedure. The variability in the usage of offering and procedure by SOS services makes it 
hard to setup these clients. 

After implementation of the SOS client and customization for a data feed from USGS, a set 
of observations (with 15 minute interval) was retrieved for a 1-day period and a 10-day 
period. Ingest times were derived. The data sets were exported to local disk in two other file 
formats for comparison: SHEF.E and PI-xml file format. 

10.1.3  Results  

Below, three data samples are displayed, all providing 8 observation values with a 15-
minute interval for the Escanaba River at Cornell, MI (NWS id CRNM4, USGS id 
04059000). 

In SHEF, the US - Standard Hydrometeorological Data Exchange Format, it looks like: 

: Date/time forecast: 20110415

File size (compressed/uncompressed) 

In terms of file size, it is clear that SHEF (not an xml-based format) is tiny compared 
to PI-xml and WaterML2. PI xml is about half the size of a WaterML2 encoding, but 
the difference becomes less when compressed using a normal zip-algorithm. 
WaterML2 compresses significantly, its compressed file is not much larger than the 
zipped PI-xml file. 

Ingest time. 

The average ingest time of the WaterML2 encoded messages for a 1-day period with 
15 minute interval data, was a factor 3 slower than the same dataset in SHEF and a 
factor 6 slower than the PI-xml encoding. The average ingest time per value reduces 
with larger timeseries, but the reduction for the PI-xml and SHEF encoded formats is 
higher than the reduction for WaterML2. 

 Issues 

The above results are from limited experiments only. Due to the ongoing evolvement 
of WaterML2 and the USGS-SOS service, the SOS client was often broken, hindering 
the ability to conduct more experiment

APPENDIX 2 - ACTIVITY PLAN USE CASES 

1. Cross Border Data Exchange Use Case: The user will discover surface water 
data from cross border or other regions via web map client and then visualize 
the time-series via web sparklines or charts. Once the data has been inspected 
and the user is satisfied that the data is of interest, the user will download the 
data in an appropriate format. 

2. Forecasting Use Case: The user will discover and download data suitable for a 
streamflow forecast. The user will be able to feed a streamflow forecast model 
with this data, but the modeling itself is not part of the scope of this IE. 

3. Global Runoff Use Case: The goal for this use case is to provide automated 
monthly and yearly volume calculations from large rivers discharging to the 
oceans.  Candidate locations for the experiment are from the Global Runoff 
Data Center (GRDC) database. A website is developed from which users can 
view station locations participating in the experiment. The locations are found 
by interrogating a federated catalog of stream gages (gage has phenomena 
discharge for the time period of interest).  Once the map is displayed, users can 
identify a gage of interest and some basic information is displayed in a popup, 
the watershed (catchment) is delineated and displayed.  The user is presented 
with two buttons and a start and end date form. The user enters a start and end 
date and chooses either (1) Monthly volumes or (2) Yearly volumes.  Once a 
button is pressed, the client application requests the daily or instantaneous 
discharge values (in various units) and the website displays a timeseries of 
monthly or yearly calculated volumes in both m^3 and cubic feet.  The 
timeseries is displayed in a table and in a graph with the graph showing gaging 
station information including name, id and basin size.  

The initial set of stations might include the Rhine and the Mississippi Rivers.
