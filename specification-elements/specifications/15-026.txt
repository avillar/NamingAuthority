Abstract 

Developed by EUROCONTROL, the Aviation Feature Schema (AFX) is a template for 
application schemas to implement by adding their operational attributes. For example, the 
Airport Mapping format can be implemented by extending AFX. The AFX defines 
concepts of geometry and temporality through predefined classes and properties. 
Therefore, these elements need not be redefined by application schemas. This means 
implementations of the AFX abide by the same structure, therefore aiding interoperability 
and allowing the rapid development of schemas. The AFX schema is designed to be 
generic and easily reusable and it is not intended to replace the standard aviation models 
such as WXXM and AIXM.  

This Engineering Report assesses the suitability of the AFX as a template for lowering 
the GIS entry level for aviation data, providing recommendations of suitability and areas 
of improvement. The report is aimed at system and client developers that shall use AFX.  

Business Value 

With the goal of lowering the GIS-entry level in aviation the AFX model focuses on 
portrayal of aviation data, including visualization and mapping of aviation related 
features. This Engineering Report assesses the suitability of the AFX as a model for the 
portrayal of aviation data, provides recommendations for improvement and reports on the 
overall quality of the model. 

Existing aviation data exchange formats, such as AIXM, IWXXM and FIXM, focus on 
the system-to-system exchange of aviation data. System-to-system exchange of 
information introduces complexities that should not impact the end-user wanting to 
visualize and map the data. AFX does not seek to replace existing aviation models. 
Instead AFX focuses on portrayal by promoting mapping and visualization of aviation 
related features that are important for improved situational awareness.

4 Testbed-11 Aviation Feature Schema Recommendations – Overview 

Developed by EUROCONTROL, the AFX is a template for implementing application 
schemas by adding their operational attributes. For example, the Airport Mapping format 
can be implemented by extending AFX. The AFX defines concepts of geometry and 
temporality through predefined classes and properties. Therefore these elements need not 
be redefined in application schemas that use AFX. This means implementations of the 
AFX abide by the same structure. This approach enhances interoperability and allows the 
rapid development of new schemas. The AFX schema is designed for aviation data 
portrayal and to be generic and easily reusable. AFX is not intended to replace the 
standard aviation exchange models, for instance Aeronautical Information Exchange 
Model (AIXM), Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM) and Flight Information 
Exchange Model (FIXM).  

This Engineering Report assesses the suitability of the AFX as a template for lowering 
the GIS entry-level for aviation data which aims to remove complexities of system-to-
system exchange formats such as AIXM and WXXM for aviation data portrayal and 
mapping, providing recommendations of suitability and areas of improvement. The report 
is aimed at system and client developers that use AFX.  

 

4.1 Motivation and requirements 

The Aviation Feature Schema (AFX) format is designed primarily to aid reusability and 
to be generic. The AFX design is driven by the purpose of portrayal and mapping - not to 
replace existing aviation exchange standards such as WXXM, FIXM and AIXM. AFX 
acts as a template for application schemas to implement by adding operational attributes. 
The motivation for this OGC Engineering Report is to, (1) assess the suitability of the 
AFX schema for portrayal (mapping and visualization) of aviation data in simple GIS 
clients, (2) maximize interoperability of AFX, and (3) make exchange, display and 
manipulation as easy as possible. 

The report provides recommendations and improvements for the AFX schema as well as 
reporting on the overall quality.

5  AFX Design Overview 

5.1 AFX Foundation 

The AFX is comprised of two components, (1) a UML conceptual model, and (2) an 
XML schema. By extending, using the AFX template, an application schema may inherit 
the structure as predefined by the classes and properties within AFX. For example, the 
concept of temporality and geometry are predefined within AFX. Therefore application 
schemas do not need to redefine these concepts. By inheriting a common structure to all 
AFX implementations the AFX enhances interoperability. 

The AFX is based on a foundation of standards from the ISO/TC 211 series, including 
ISO191361 (GML) and ISO19115 (Metadata). (see Figure 1). GML serves as a modeling 
and encoding language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange format for 
geographic transactions on the Internet. By extending and reusing types from GML, AFX 
presents multiple benefits that are presented later in the document. ISO19115 (and 
ISO19139) is the best practice for geospatial metadata, allowing a description of the data 
to be provided alongside the data.     

                                                

1 The Geography Markup Language (GML), an XML grammar defined by the OGC, was adopted as an International 
Standard in 2007 (ISO19136). GML remains to be maintained and enhanced by the OGC. 



OGC 15-026

5.2 AFX Components 

The AFX is comprised of two components: 

1. AFX conceptual model (UML). 

2. AFX physical model (XSD). 

These components provide a structure that should be adopted by the application schemas 
that implement the AFX format. The structure inherited by implementations of AFX is 
defined within the classes and properties within the UML and XSD. 

5.2.1 AFX Conceptual Model (UML) 

The AFX conceptual model is represented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) format.  

The AFX conceptual model UML includes packages containing the foundation standards, 
as discussed in Section 6.1; these include the ISO/TC 211 package which provides ISO 
standards covering areas of digital geographic information and geomatics such as the 
Geography Markup Language (GML). 

Three major components exist within the AFX conceptual model: 

1. AviationMessage 

2. AviationFeature 

3. AviationFeatureState & AviationFeatureTransition 

Throughout the AFX conceptual model, classes are colour-coded to represent the 
following:

 Blue - A foundation class (for example, a class inherited from GML). 



OGC 15-026

5.2.1.1 AviationMessage 

The AviationMessage component extends the GML AbstractFeatureCollection; this 
enables a collection of aviation features to be defined within a single message. The 
AviationMessage is associated with AviationFeature with a multiplicity of optional-to-
many (‘0..*’). This relationship enables associations to zero to many AviationFeatures 
(Figure 2).  

The AviationMessage component provides a similar function to the AIXMBasicMessage 
component of the AIXM conceptual model. 

The AviationMessage class also offers the option to include ISO 19115 compliant 
metadata in-situ within the data or externally referenced. The ISO 19139 specification 
provides an XML schema implementation profile derived from the ISO 19115 abstract 
metadata specification. 



OGC 15-026 

10 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

 

5.2.1.2 AviationFeature 

The AviationFeature class represents an abstraction of a real world phenomenon. The 
AviationFeature class is an abstract class that is derived from ‘gml:AbstractFeatureType’; 
application schemas implementing AFX will populate this class. For example, when 
implementing the Airport Mapping format by extending AFX, feature types include 
AM_AerodromeReferencePoint, AM_TaxiwayElement and AM_ApronElement. 

The AviationFeature is associated with the TM_Period class (GML) giving the 
AviationFeature class a property named ‘lifeTime’. The ‘lifeTime’ property allows the 
storage of the feature lifetime, for example from initial feature commissioning to feature 
decommissioning; this is done using a GML TimePeriod. The lifetime property will be a 
common property of all features extending the AviationFeature class.    

The AviationFeature may contain an unlimited number of AviationFeatureStates and/or 
AviationFeatureTransitions; these are discussed further in the following section (see 
Figure 3). 

Similar to the AviationMessage class, the AviationFeature class also offers the option to 
include ISO 19115 compliant metadata in-situ within the data or externally referenced. 
The ISO 19139 specification provides an XML schema implementation profile derived 
from the ISO 19115 abstract metadata specification.

5.2.1.3 AviationFeatureState and AviationFeatureTransition 

Each AviationFeature may contain multiple AviationFeatureStates and/or 
AviationFeatureTransitions. Both AviationFeatureState and AviationFeatureTransition 
classes are abstract; the application schema implementing AFX will populate the classes 
as a specialization. These classes will contain time-varying feature properties, for 
example an aerodrome’s name. An explanation of the class differences is shown below.  

AviationFeatureState 

A feature ‘state’ is a time period; throughout the time period of a single feature state the 
feature properties remain the same (see Figure 4). If a feature property changes, a new 
feature state is instantiated and all feature properties, including those that did not change 
are copied to the new feature state. These feature states do not overlap. The time instant 
when a feature state changes is called a ‘transition’, a description of feature transitions is 
provided later in the document.  

The AviationFeatureState is associated with multiple properties: 

1. afx:validTime – the GML time period for which the feature state is valid for. 

2. afx:geometry – the GML geometry (limited to point, linestring and polygon) for 
the feature state. 

3. afx:limits – upper and lower elevation limits of the feature. 

4. afx:metadata / afx:metadataLocation – the associated ISO metadata. 

5. gml:boundedBy – a GML envelope describing the minimum bounding box 
encompassing the feature. 

6. gml:identifier – a  feature identifier. 

7. gml:description / gml:descriptionReference – feature description, or reference 
to feature description. 

8. gml:name – feature name. 

All AviationFeatureState properties are optional. This is to ease validation of adaptation 
and implementation of AFX. For example, an application schema implementing AFX 
may not be concerned with the metadata or limits of a particular feature. By being 
optional, the exclusion of these unwanted properties is permitted.

AviationFeatureTransition 

A feature ‘transition’ is a time instant; a feature transition occurs when a feature state 
changes. The feature transition may contain all the feature properties contained within the 
feature state (see Figure 5). 

The AviationFeatureTransition is associated with multiple properties: 

1. afx:transitionTime – the GML time instant for which the feature transition is 
valid for. 

2. afx:geometry – the GML geometry (limited to point, linestring and polygon) for 
the feature transition. 

3. afx:limits – upper and lower elevation limits of the feature. 

4. afx:metadata / afx:metadataLocation – the associated ISO metadata.

5.2.2 AFX Physical Model (XSD) 

The AviationFeature and AviationMessage components of the AFX model have 
corresponding XML schemas (XSDs) based on GML. The schemas provide a physical 
implementation of the conceptual UML model. 

To future proof the AFX XSDs two different namespaces are used for each schema. As 
such, the schemas could evolve independently down different paths. 

5.2.2.1 aviationMessage.xsd 

The aviationMessage.xsd schema declares itself a GML FeatureCollection element by 
extending the AviationMessage element from gml:AbstractFeatureCollection. The 
AviationMessage element may contain any number of GML features as members. A 
similar function is observed within AIXM and the AIXMBasicMessage element. 

The AviationMessage may also be accompanied with embedded or externally referenced 
metadata using the metadata and metadataLocation elements. Embedded metadata 
conforms to ISO 19115 Geographic Information Metadata standards.  

5.2.2.2 aviationFeature.xsd 

The aviationFeature.xsd schema declares the structure of each feature, for example each 
feature may include any number of states and/or transitions, associated metadata and a 
feature lifetime. Each state and / or transition may (or may not) contain a validTime, 
geometry, limits and metadata property. These data types are defined within the 
aviationFeature.xsd schema.

6 AMXS AFX Implementation Example 

Developed by EUROCONTROL, the Airport Mapping Exchange Schema (AMXS) is an 
exchange format for airport data. The AMXS is an XML schema designed to implement 
the Airport Mapping Exchange Model (AMXM). The AMXS defines 33 feature types for 
airport mapping. By extending from AFX, the following section demonstrates an 
example of how the AMXS can implement AFX.   

The Airport Mapping format AM_Package inherits from the AFX AviationMessage class 
(Figure 6).    

 

Figure 6 Example of inheritance from Airport Mapping AM_Package to AFX AviationMessage. 

 

Each feature type within the Airport Mapping format inherits from the AviationFeature 
AFX class. Ultimately the Airport Mapping features inherit from the 
AviationFeatureState, various properties specific to the Airport Mapping format are 
added to the AviationFeatureState (Figure 7).

6.2 AMXS AFS Implementation WFS Example 

As the AFX and application schemas that implement the AFX extend GML, the 
OGC/ISO Web Feature Service (WFS) interface standard can be used as a request-
response interface for AFX data. The design of the AFX is founded upon the principle of 
interoperability and ease of use. As a result the AFX has been designed to account for 
limitations of WFS 1.1.0. The AFX uses a restricted set of GML 3.2 constructs and 
allows ISO metadata to be included either in situ within the messages, or referenced to an 
external location. 

The AMXS implementation of AFX is able to be served via a WFS. An example request 
for an AM_TaxiwayElement feature is provided below. 

http://[host]:[port]/[wfsName]/[servletURL]?service=wfs&version=1.1.0 
&request=GetFeature&typename=AM_TaxiwayElement 

 

Many GIS tools are able to connect to a WFS instance to visualize and map data 
responses. Figure 8 illustrates the portrayal of airport mapping information in a FOSS2 
(QGIS v2.8.1).

7 AFX Assessment and Discussion 

The ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM) aims to provide a conceptual blueprint 
for physical implementations in order to encourage semantic interoperability and 
common understanding. The AIRM is a consolidated logical UML model used as a 
common reference for civil, military and civil-military information constructs, relevant to 
the different domain applications within ATM currently in the SESAR development 
phase. 

Mature aviation data exchange formats exist as physical implementations of the 
conceptual AIRM, for example, AIXM, WXXM and FIXM (Figure 9). These physical 
implementations have been designed primarily for the exchange of aeronautical, weather 
and flight information between systems using XML-based encodings. These aviation data 
models are inherently complex due to the complex and often transient real-world 
phenomena that they represent, coupled with the business need for system-to-system data 
transfer.  

 

Figure 9 Physical implementations of the AIRM for ATM application domains. 

Although these aforementioned exchange formats represent real-world phenomena 
similar to those that AFX implementations represent, the complex encodings of AIXM, 
WXXM and FIXM are suited for system-to-system data exchanges. The complexities of 
such encodings do not meet the business needs for aviation data portrayal and mapping; 
this business need has driven the development of the Aviation Feature Schema (AFX).  

The AFX format is designed primarily to aid reusability and to be generic. The design is 
driven by the purpose of portrayal and mapping - not to replace existing aviation 
exchange standards such as AIXM, WXXM and FIXM. The AFX acts as a template for 
application schemas to implement by adding operational attributes; for example the 
Airport Mapping format can be implemented through extending AFX. The AFX attempts 
to realize ultimate interoperability by defining concepts of temporality and geometry, 



OGC 15-026 

22 Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

removing the need for the application schema that implements AFX to redefine these 
concepts. Ultimately the AFX promotes rapid development of schemas by allowing 
different applications schemas to adopt the same overarching structure, thereby aiding 
interoperability.  

As a format for portrayal and mapping, the AFX is designed with several key principles 
in mind, (1) to be exchanged via web services, for example via the OGC/ISO Web 
Feature Service (WFS) interface standard, and (2) to lower the GIS entry-level in aviation 
so that custom-built tools are not required to map and portray the data, as often observed 
with more complex aviation models such as AIXM. 

7.1 Compliance to GML Application Schema Encoding Rules 

The Aviation Feature Schema (AFX) as well as the Aerodrome Mapping schema 
(AMXM), which is an application schema built on top of AFX, have been analyzed in 
Testbed 11 (see Figure 10). 

 

Figure 10 Overview of the aviation feature schemas and their dependencies. 

 

The review of the conceptual schemas of AFX and AMXM as well as their XML 
implementation schemas revealed that they do not fully comply with the GML 
application schema encoding rules. 

The schemas use stereotypes that are not defined for GML application schema, such as 
<<XSDsimpleType>>, <<XSDcomplexType>>, <<XSDrestriction>>, <<deprecated>>, 
and <<Choice>> (see Figure 11).

Figure 11 XML schema specific datatypes defined in Aerodrome Mapping schema. 

 

Some of these stereotypes could be mapped to well-known stereotypes or ignored 
altogether. For example, <<Choice>> could be mapped to <<union>>. 

Especially the use of the <<XSD…>> stereotypes is problematic. They are used to 
specify datatypes, with the value type as well as minimum and maximum value range 
where appropriate. This modeling approach pollutes the conceptual schema with 
implementation details; in this case the conceptual schema is heavily geared towards an 
XML Schema implementation. This is an issue whenever other implementation schemas, 
for example a JSON or database schema, are being derived from the conceptual schema. 
The issue could easily be avoided by following ISO/OGC best practices on application 
schema modeling.  One could define <<dataType>> classes that have a “value” property 
of the appropriate type (e.g. “CharacterString”, “Real”, “Boolean”, “Integer”) and 
constraints (e.g. declared using OCL) that specify allowed value ranges. 

That the ISO/OGC best practices on application schema modeling are not followed in 
aviation feature schemas is a general issue for all software components that rely on 
compliance of schemas and actual data with these best practices. This requires 
customization and can be problematic with respect to interoperability with ISO/OGC 
standards based software. 

There are more examples of the aviation feature schemas not following the GML 
application schema encoding rules.  

The conceptual model does not define the tagged value “inlineOrByReference” for the 
properties of a class. Application schema processing software such as ShapeChange that

read the conceptual schema, for example to derive Schematron code, therefore assumes 
that the default defined for this tagged value applies. The default is 
“inlineOrByReference”3. However, in the AFX XML Schema the encoding is just 
“inline” (example: property “state” in class FeatureContentChoice). This can lead to 
unexpected results and even to wrong results. The issue could easily be resolved by 
declaring the tagged value “inlineOrByReference” in the conceptual model whenever the 
XML encoding deviates from the encoding that results from the default for this tagged 
value. 

Another example is the modeling of <<Choice>> types. A <<Choice>> resembles a 
<<union>> type, which is covered by the GML application schema encoding rules. 
However, in the conceptual schema of AFX no name is assigned to the property that is of 
the choice/union type (see Figure 12). 

 

Figure 12 Model of a choice between a state and a transition in the Aviation Feature Schema. 

This is not compliant with GML application schema encoding rules. It is even different to 
how <<choice>> types are modeled in AIXM4. From a practical perspective, this can be 
an issue for example when formulating SBVR constraints. Software like the SBVR-to-

                                                

3 The other enumeration values defined for the “inlineOrByReference” tagged value are “inline” and “byReference”. 
4 The Aviation community appears to use modeling and encoding rules that are not only different to those defined by 
ISO/OGC but also to each other.

Schematron derivation tool developed in Testbed 11 (OGC 15-024) would need to be 
customized to support processing aviation feature schemas. Again, this issue could easily 
be solved by following the ISO/OGC best practices, in this case with respect to how 
properties and union types are modeled.

7.2 Developing a Format for Portrayal 

A format for portrayal of aviation data could be developed using a number of methods. 
Firstly, a top-down approach could be undertaken, whereby a mature aviation exchange 
standard is adopted and repurposed for the function of portrayal. Or secondly, a bottom-
up approach could be undertaken, whereby an aviation data portrayal standard is 
developed from scratch and restrictions are imposed via profiling. The former approach is 
investigated by assessing the plausibility of profiling AIXM specifically for the purpose 
of data portrayal. The latter approach is investigated by assessing the application of a 
profile to the existing AFX.   

 

7.2.1 Profiling AIXM 

AIXM, although dissimilar to AFX with respect to model complexities and use cases, 
could be used as a foundation for producing a similar result to the AFX model by using 
profiling methods. 

By profiling AIXM, a controlled subset of the AIXM model for representing real-world 
aviation phenomena could be produced; profiling AIXM in this way would make 
interoperability and wider implementation more achievable. Profiling the AIXM model 
allows AIXM to be repurposed from its original use case of ‘system-to-system 
exchanges’, to ‘exchange for portrayal and mapping’ of aviation data. The use of AIXM 
profiles to simply represent aviation data is already being investigated; however in some 
cases new schemas have been created, for example the Simple Aeronautical Features 
(SAF) schema used in IWXXM to represent aeronautical features such as aerodromes and 
runways. 

Table 1 presents advantages and disadvantages of AIXM profiling to produce a data 
format for aviation data portrayal and mapping. 

Table 1 Advantages and disadvantages of profiling AIXM for portrayal and mapping. 

Advantages Disadvantages 

The same exchange model is used; therefore 
existing AIXM systems would support this. 

The complexity of the temporality model and 
change management mechanism would remain. 

A simplified AIXM model would enable wider 
GIS software support. 

Retain the same structural encodings of 
concepts, but use cases are very different. 

Multiple features types already defined within 
AIXM. 

Problems that result in reverse associations and 
other extensions are inherited.

Profiling AIXM would not meet the requirements of a schema for simple GIS 
exploitation for airport mapping.

7.2.2 Profiling AFX with GML Simple Features Profile 

Alternatively to profiling AIXM, AFX implementations could be subject to GML profile 
compliance. Currently, the implementation of AFX is flexible, allowing the end-user to 
add operational attributes with varying complexities. AFX implementations could be 
restricted to a subset of the XML-schema and GML scope which would ensure a vendor’s 
implementations remained interoperable between clients, and usable with simple GIS 
tools.  

The profile itself would define strict rules that adhere to common GIS modeling 
approaches, including the structure and types used. Numerous AFX implementations may 
be developed that adhere to the profile while retaining interoperability between vendors 
and applications. 

Features must be defined using a well-known and simplified feature model that can be 
represented using only the GML and XML-schema components defined within the 
profile. 

 

7.2.2.1 GML Simple Feature Profile 

Table 2 presents a comparison of the GML packages included within multiple versions of 
the GML specification, the GML Simple Features Profile and the AFX Implementation 
as presented in section 6.

As presented by Table 2, the AFX implementation presented in section 6 uses the same 
GML packages as the GML Simple Features Profile; therefore the AMXS AFX 
implementation could adhere to the GML Simple Features Profile.  

The AMXS was designed with interoperability and compatibility in mind. The AMXS 
design is intended to make the implementations compatible with third-party GML-
compliant applications, and therefore enable end users to use the AMXS data in 
Geographic Information Systems (GISs). 

Implementations of AFX that do not use application schemas that have been designed 
with portrayal and simplicity in mind, such as AIXM, will inherit complexities from 
those application schemas.  

It is worth noting, ground-based routing would not be possible due to the lack of support 
for topology within the GML Simple Feature Profile, however this may not be applicable 
if AFX implementations are used solely for portrayal (visualization and mapping).

Three levels of compliance to the GML Simple Features Profile are defined; Table 3 
presents the level compliance criteria. 

Table 3 Capabilities of Level 0, 1 and 2 of the GML Simple Features Profile. 

 Level 0 (SF-0) Level 1 (SF-1) Level 2 (SF-2) 

Restricted set of built-in non-spatial 
property type Yes

1 Yes1 No 

Restricted set of spatial property types Yes2 Yes2 Yes2 

Use of nillable and xsi:nil No Yes Yes 

User-defined property types No Yes Yes 

Cardinality of properties 0 or 1 0..unbounded 0..unbounded 

Non-spatial property values references Yes3 Yes3 Yes 

Spatial property values references Yes3 Yes3 Yes 

1 String, integer, measurement, date, real, binary, Boolean, URI. 
2 Point, Curve (LineString), Surface (Polygon), Geometry, MultiPoint, MultiCurve, MultiSurface, 
MultiGeometry.  
3 In level 0 and 1, remote values for properties are supported only through the use of the type 
gml:ReferenceType. The more generalized GML property-type pattern allowing mixed inline and by-
reference encoded property values within the same instance document is disallowed. 

 

In order to maximize interoperability and GIS entry level for aviation data, SF-0 should 
be followed. 

Compliance level SF-0 is the most restrictive, SF-1 less restrictive and SF-2 the least 
restrictive whilst still abiding to the GML Simple Features Profile.  

Implementations of AFX will require multiple instances of properties within a single 
feature due to the AviationFeatureState and AviationFeatureTransition properties; there 
SF-0 is not applicable. 

Compliance level SF-1 does not allow the use of inline and by-reference property values 
within the same instance document. As AFX allows ISO metadata to be included via 
inline or by-reference within the same instance document, compliance level SF-1 is too 
restrictive for AFX implementations to adhere to.  

Compliance level SF-2, essentially the OGC Simple Features Specification places no 
restrictions on non-spatial properties. Spatial properties remain subject to the types listed 
in Table 3 and the restriction on remote or referenced geometric property values observed 
in SF-0 and SF-1 is removed.

Whilst AFX implementations would require use of restricted capabilities in SF-0 and SF-
1, SF-2 allows restriction to be placed on AFX implementations, but does not restrict 
required capabilities. 

7.2.3 Geometry in AFX Implementations 

While the GeometryChoice element of the AFX model restricts a feature’s geometry to 
be encoded as a Point, LineString or Polygon, complex representations of geometries 
exist within other aviation data models. For example, the AIXM 5.1 model allows 
complex geometry types such as ArcByCenterPoint, CircleByCenterPoint and 
GeodesicString, see Figure 13 and Figure 14.   

Complex geometry types such as those noted are unlikely to be supported out-the-box by 
most GIS tools and for these complex geometries to be encoded in AFX implementations, 
geometries must first undergo simplification, densification and/or generalization.

AFX implementations offer the flexibility for a vendor to forgo the optional AFX defined 
geometry element, and to define their own geometries. Without restriction on usable 
geometry types a vendor may define a complex geometry type that may be incompatible 
simple GIS tools. By AFX implementations adhering to the GML Simple Feature Profile, 
AFX implementations would be restricted to the following geometry types: 

 Point 

 Curve (LineString) 



OGC 15-026 

Copyright © 2015 Open Geospatial Consortium. 33 
 

 Surface (Polygon) 

 Geometry 

 Multipoint 

 MultiCurve 

 MultiSurface 

 MultiGeometry 
 

The benefit of restricting usable geometry types is to foster maximum interoperability of 
the geospatial data; support for these simple geometry types is offered by many off-the-
shelf GIS tools.  
The AFX implementation example using AMXS as presented in section 6 utilizes the 
following geometry types, (1) Point, (2) LineString, and (3) Polygon. This 
implementation example would therefore comply with the GML simple features profile. 

 
7.2.3.1 Generalised Geometries 

When AIXM 5.1 data is rendered in a GIS display, the use case for exploitation can vary 
from small to very large scale. The need for densification of AIXM geometries for 
representation for AMXS raises the question of accuracy requirements. It could be the 
case that multiple representations of AMXS data be generated for varying scales to 
support GIS or web-app use cases.

7.2.4 Temporality in AFX Implementations 

Many aviation data exchange models include complex representations of time; for 
example AIXM is built upon an exhaustive temporality model; this complexity is 
required due to the dynamic and often transient nature of the real-world phenomena the 
model represents. For example, the AIXM temporality model is capable of modeling 
permanent and temporary change, intrinsic change and feature states at points in time.   

The AFX model defines a temporality concept that is inherited by the application schema 
that implements AFX. The temporality model consists of two major temporal 
components, (1) feature states, and (2) feature state transitions (Figure 15). The 
temporality model adopted by AFX describes feature states and transitions. A transition 
is a change in one or more feature properties. A feature state is a feature property set 
valid over a period of time. These temporal components are similar to AIXM 
‘BASELINE’ and ‘PERMDELTA’ time slices. The AFX temporality model lacks a 
concept of temporary change, intrinsic change or feature states at points in time. 

The differences between the complex temporality model of AIXM and the less complex 
representation of temporality in AFX results from the differing business needs of the 
models. Since AFX implementations are designed for portrayal and mapping of aviation 
data, a comprehensive temporality model is not required.        

The AFX models the feature lifetime element outside of the temporality model (unlike 
AIXM) so when modeling historic data, this structure is acceptable. However, when 
exchanging future data, situations where the planned feature lifetime may alter. Therefore 
the feature lifetime element should be incorporated within the temporality model.  

 

Figure 15 AFX temporality concept – feature states and transitions.

7.2.5 Change Management 

AFX does not include a method of version control or change management. For example, 
within AIXM’s exhaustive temporality model the ‘sequenceNumber’ and 
‘correctionNumber’ elements allow the vendor to submit updates and corrections to time 
slices. 

An AFX implementation may construct a version of change management itself, by 
adding elements that allow a state or transition to be version controlled. For instance, 
similar constructs to ‘sequenceNumber’ and ‘correctionNumber’ could be instantiated 
within the AviationFeatureState and AviationFeatureTransition classes. 

Alternatively, similar to the change management approach adopted by FIXM, the change 
management of feature states/transitions is the responsibility of the end-user. This change 
management approach is undertaken on the client-side.

8 Observations and Recommendations 

8.1 Observations 

This section provides observations based on the overall design and technical 
implementation analysis of the AFX as discussed in sections 5, 6 and 7. These 
observations are presented in Table 4. 

Table 4 AFX Observations. 

Observation 
Number Description Impact 

1.  
AFX implementations do not restrict 
elements that can be inherited from 
application schema implementations. 

Complex geometries, types and temporality models 
could be introduced to AFX implementations - these 
may be incompatible with COTS GIS clients. 

2.  
AFX is licensed under BSD license 
template as provided by the Open Source 
Initiative. 

May have Intellectual Property Right implications for 
those implementing AFX.  

3.  
There is no constraint to say that there 
must be at least one AviationFeatureState 
or AviationFeature in an AviationMessage 
element. 

An AviationMessage containing zero 
AviationFeatureStates or AviationFeatures would be 
a valid message. 

4.  

The lifeTime element is not static when 
considering future data, therefore should 
reside within the temporal model. 

The lifetime of a feature is a dynamic element and 
may change throughout time, particularly when 
considering future data. This should be modeled 
within the AviationFeatureState and 
AviationFeatureTransition classes. 

5.  
Unlike other aviation related exchange 
models, for example AIXM, FIXM and 
WXXM, the AFX does not extend the 
AIRM. 

For interoperability reasons it would be 
recommended to use the AIRM reference model to 
extend domain specific application schemas from. 

6.  
The AFX is not aligned with the Simple 
Aeronautical Features schema within 
IWXXM. 

Risk of non-interoperable implementations despite 
the similarity of the logical entities encoded in the 
physical schema. 

7.  

Maximum GIS support would be reached 
through GML Simple Features Profile 
compliance level SF-0 adherence. 

GML subset is smaller than the GML Simple 
Features Profile; therefore GML support by GIS 
client would be minimal. 
However current, temporal and metadata 
requirements do not allow AFX implementations to 
reach the SF-0 compliance level. 

8.  Geometry scales could be created depending on GIS use cases. 
GIS use cases for AFX implementations need be 
developed. 

9.  

The review of the conceptual schemas of 
AFX and AMXM as well as their XML 
implementation schemas revealed that 
they do not fully comply with the GML 
application schema encoding rules. 

The fact that ISO/OGC best practices on application 
schema modeling are not followed in aviation feature 
schemas is a general issue for all software 
components that rely on compliance of schemas and 
actual data with these best practices.

10.  

The aviation feature schemas have been 
implemented using AFX specific 
modeling and encoding rules, rather than 
following ISO/OGC best practices. 

In principle a community of interest (COI) can 
always define its own modeling and encoding rules. 
This is especially true if existing standards do not 
cover or are – or appear to be – incompatible with 
specific requirements of the COI6. However, this 
does not seem to be the case here.  

 

                                                

6 The modeling and encoding of dynamic features to meet the needs of the aviation community, for example, is not yet 
covered by ISO/OGC standards. Thus specific rules had to be developed by the Aviation community to model and 
encode AIXM (even though some of the basic rules, for example to model properties and unions, could have been 
adopted from ISO/OGC standards).  

FIXM is an example where ISO/OGC modeling and encoding rules do not appear to satisfy the requirements of the 
Aviation community. The results of OGC Testbed 10 show how the FIXM model and encoding could be modified to be 
compliant with ISO/OGC standards, with minimal impact on the actual encoding (for further details, see OGC 
document 14-037). Actual proof that ISO/OGC based modeling and encoding of FIXM does not satisfy the 
requirements has yet to be provided.

8.2 Recommendations 

Based on the technical analysis (sections 5 and 7), observations (section 8) and 
implementations (section 6) of the AFX, this section provides suggested 
recommendations and improvements for the AFX (Table 5). 

Table 5 AFX Recommendations. 

Recommendation 
Number Recommendation 

1.  
Utilize GML profiling techniques to restrict implementations of AFX to a simple 
subset of the GML specification, therefore ensuring compliance with simple GIS 
clients. 

2.  

Specify a minimum occurrence of the AviationFeatureState, 
AviationFeatureTransition and AviationFeature elements.  
By differentiating the AviationFeatureState and AviationFeatureTransition 
elements, it has forced a minimum occurrence of ‘0’, however by defining a 
generic element with a property that defines whether the it refers to a feature state 
or transition would allow a minimum occurrence of ‘1’ to be set.  

3.  
Move the lifeTime element from outside of the temporal concept to within the 
feature state or transition elements as the feature lifetime may alter throughout a 
feature’s lifetime. 

4.  
Assess the impact of the AFX being licensed under the BSD license template as 
provided by the Open Source Initiative. IPR of implementations may impact 
uptake and implementation of AFX.  

5.  

The aviation feature schemas have been implemented using AFX specific 
modeling and encoding rules, rather than following ISO/OGC best practices. A 
more detailed analysis of AFX modeling requirements should be performed, to 
determine if any of them cannot be covered by ISO/OGC modeling and encoding 
rules. If it turns out that this is not the case, in other words that ISO/OGC rules 
satisfy all requirements, then it is recommended that future versions of AFX be 
implemented following these rules, to improve interoperability within the wider 
geospatial community. 

6.  

The well-established and proven encoding rules defined by ISO/OGC standards 
should be re-used by the aviation feature schemas. Doing so would also allow 
ISO/OGC standards based commercial off the shelf software to process AFX data 
without requiring (AFX) specific extensions and customizations. Adhering to 
ISO/OGC standards, in this case to the modeling principles defined by these 
standards, enables interoperability within the wider geospatial community.
