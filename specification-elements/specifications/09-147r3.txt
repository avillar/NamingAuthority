Introduction 

The OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic retrieval of geospatial data as 
"coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phe-
nomena. 

This document specifies an extension to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) 2.0 core to 
allow for client/server communication using HTTP GET with key/value pair (KVP) encod-
ing.

OGC® Web Coverage Service 2.0 Interface Standard - 
KVP Protocol Binding Extension - Corrigendum 

1 Scope  

This document specifies how Web Coverage Service (WCS) clients and servers can com-
municate over the Internet using HTTP GET with key/value pair (KVP) encoding. 

2 Conformance 

Standardization target are WCS 2.0 implementations (currently: servers).  

This document establishes a single requirements class, get-kvp, of URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_get-kvp/1.0/req/get-kvp with a single 
pertaining conformance class, get-kvp, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-
binding_get-kvp/1.0/conf/get-kvp. Requirements and conformance test URIs defined in this 
document are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_get-kvp/1.0/. 

Annex A lists the conformance tests which shall be exercised on any software artefact claim-
ing to implement an OGC WCS using this extension.  

3 Normative references 

This OGC WCS 2.0 KVP Protocol Binding Extension consists of the present document and 
an XML Schema. The complete specification is identified by OGC URI 
http://www.opengis.net/spec/WCS_protocol-binding_get-kvp/1.0, the document has OGC 
URI http://www.opengis.net/doc/ISx/WCS_protocol-binding_get-kvp/1.0.  

The Web Coverage Service 2.0.1 standard is available for download from 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs; additionally, the XML Schema is posted 
online at http://schemas.opengis.net/wcs/2.0 as part of the OGC schema repository. In the 
event of a discrepancy between bundled and schema repository versions of the XML Schema 
files, the schema repository shall be considered authoritative. 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this text, 
constitute provisions of this specification. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, 
or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. For undated references, the latest edi-
tion of the normative document referred to applies.

4 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in the above references 
apply. 

5 Conventions 

5.1 UML notation 

All the diagrams that appear in this specification are presented using the Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) static structure diagram, as described in Subclause 5.2 of OGC Web Ser-
vice Common [OGC 06-121r9]. 

5.2 Data dictionary tables 

The UML model data dictionary is specified herein in a series of tables. The contents of the 
columns in these tables are described in Subclause 5.5 of [OGC 06-121r9]. The contents of 
these data dictionary tables are normative, including any table footnotes. 

6 HTTP/GET with KVP 

6.1 General 

Requirement 1 /req/get-kvp/extension-identifier: 
A WCS service implementing this extension shall include the following URI in the Profile 
element of the ServiceIdentification in a GetCapabilities response: 
  http://www.opengis.net/spec/ 
   WCS_protocol-binding_get-kvp/1.0/conf/get-kvp 

Requirement 2 /req/get-kvp/url-encoding: 
Operation requests shall URL-encode special characters as defined in [1].  

Example  Use “%3F” to represent a question mark, “?”. 

Requirement 3 /req/get-kvp/case-sensitivity: 
Keys shall be case insensitive, values shall be case sensitive. 

While this requirement is strict, the corresponding conformance test tentatively does not 
stamp an implementation non-conformant if it is elastic in also recognizing a wrong case in 
values, as long as this does not cause a conflict.  

Example “REQUEST=GETCAPABILITIES” allows unambiguous recognition of the canonical val-
ue “GetCapabilities”. For coverage identifiers, on the other hand, case distinction is essential.

Requirement 4 /req/get-kvp/content-type-header: 
Operation responses shall include the Content-Type header field as defined by IETF RFC 
2616 [2]. 

Example “Content-Type: application/gml+xml” 

6.2 GetCapabilities 

A GetCapabilities request in the get-kvp conformance class consists of an URL with KVP 
parameters, while the response – a capabilities document – is an XML document. 

Example To request a Capabilities document, a client can issue the following minimal GetCap-
abilities operation request encoded as KVP: 

http://hostname:port/path?service=WCS&request=GetCapabilities 

Requirement 5 /req/get-kvp/getCapabilities-response-structure: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall be a valid XML document of type 
wcs:CapabilitiesType. 

Example See [OGC 09-110r3]. 

6.3 DescribeCoverage 

Requirement 6 /req/get-kvp/describeCoverage-request-structure: 
The KVP encoding of a DescribeCoverage request shall be as defined in Table 1. 

Table 1 — DescribeCoverage request URL encoding 

Name Definition Data type Multiplicity

6.4 GetCoverage 

Requirement 7 /req/get-kvp/getCoverage-request-structure: 
The KVP encoding of a GetCoverage request shall be as defined in Table 2. 

Table 2 — GetCoverage request KVP encoding 

Name Definition Data type Multiplicity 
service Identifier of the OGC service String,  

fixed to “WCS”

which the coverage returned is encoded 

anyURI zero or one 
(optional) 

mediaType If present, enforces a multipart encod-
ing 

anyURI zero or one 
(optional) 

 

Requirement 8 /req/get-kvp/getCoverage-request-subsetspec: 
Each SubsetSpec shall adhere to this EBNF syntax: 
 SubsetSpec:  dimension ( intervalOrPoint )  
 dimension:   NCName 
 intervalOrPoint: interval | point 
 interval:   low , high 
 low:     point | * 
 high:    point | * 
 point:    number | " token "  // " = double quote = ASCII 0x42 

Syntax rules are as follows [2]: underlined tokens represent literals which appear “as is” 
(“terminal symbols”), other tokens represent sub-expressions to be substituted (“non-
terminals”). A vertical bar (“|”) denotes alternatives, items in brackets (“[ ]”) are optional. 
Non-terminals NCName, number, token, and anyURI follow the resp. XML definitions. 

NOTE Allowed values for points are determined by the CRS used. Examples include “2009-11-06” for 
time, -41.5 and “41°5’ ” for lat/long, and 100 for array coordinates; note that non-numeric values have to be 
enclosed in double quotes. 

Example The following KVP-encoded GetCoverage request addresses service path on server 
www.myservice.org at port port retrieves all range fields of RectifiedGridCoverage C0002 in the 
domain specified by the (array coordinate) bounding box with longitude between 1000 and 2000 and lati-
tude between 5000 and 6000, with a slice point in time given by "2009-11-06T23:20:52Z":

Keys shall be case insensitive, values shall be case sensitive. 

Test method: For each request type: 

 send requests to the server under test containing lower, mixed, and 
upper case keys. Check proper response. 

 Send requests to the server under test with different case in values, 
except for the REQUEST and VERSION parameters. Check that 
the server differentiates in its response. 

Test passes if all individual tests pass. 

Content type header 

Test id: /conf/get-kvp/content-type-header 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/get-kvp/content-type-header: 
Operation responses shall include the Content-Type header field as defined 
by IETF RFC 2616 [2]. 

Test method: For each request type: 

 send admissible requests to the server under test. Check that, in the 
response, the content type header is set appropriately. 

Test passes if all individual tests pass. 

GetCapabilities response structure 

Test id: /conf/get-kvp/getCapabilities-response-structure 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/get-kvp/getCapabilities-response-structure: 
The response to a successful GetCapabilities request shall be a valid XML 
document of type wcs:CapabilitiesType. 

Test method: Send a valid GetCapabilities request. Pass test if an XML validator reports 
validity of the response document against its schema definition. 

A.1.1 DescribeCoverage request encoding 

Test id: /conf/get-kvp/describeCapabilities-request-structure 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/get-kvp/describeCoverage-request-structure: 
The KVP encoding of a DescribeCoverage request shall be as defined in 
Table 1.

Test method: Send DescribeCoverage requests testing server response on the cases dis-
tinguished in said reference. Check proper response. 

A.1.2 GetCoverage request encoding 

Test id: /conf/get-kvp/getCoverage-request-structure 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/get-kvp/getCoverage-request-structure: 
The KVP encoding of a GetCoverage request shall be as defined in Table 
2. 

Test method: Send GetCoverage requests testing server response on the cases distin-
guished in said reference. Check proper response. 

A.1.3 GetCoverage subset specification 

Test id: /conf/get-kvp/getCoverage-request-subsetspec 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/get-kvp/getCoverage-request-subsetspec: 
Each SubsetSpec shall adhere to this EBNF syntax: 
 SubsetSpec:  dimension ( intervalOrPoint )  
 dimension:   NCName 
 intervalOrPoint: interval | point 
 interval:   low , high 
 low:     point | * 
 high:    point | * 
 point:    number | " token "  // " = double quote = 
ASCII 0x42 

Test method: Send GetCoverage requests to the service under test, evaluate whether re-
sponses are adequate. Exercise tests for each of the following situations for 
each coverage dimensionality supported by the server: 

 No subsetting parameter 
 One or more trimmings, no slicing 
 One or more slicings, no trimming 
 trim operations with trim coordinates and with “*” for low and high 

bound (independently) 

Pass if coverage responses indicate (by range set inspection) that the opera-
tion has been recognized and executed properly.

A.1.4 Exceptions 

Test id: /conf/get-kvp/exceptions 

Test Purpose: Requirement /req/get-kvp/exceptions: 
When a WCS server encounters an error described in column “meaning of 
exception code” in Table 3 then it shall return the corresponding exception 
report message with the contents of the locator parameter value as speci-
fied in the right column of  Table 3. 

Test method: Send requests of all types supported to the server under test. Each request 
shall include all (mandatory and) optional parameters and shall be valid 
except for one parameter which shall contain an encoding error described in 
the exception specification. Test passes if exception is reported according to 
requirement.
