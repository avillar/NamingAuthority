OGC® Testbed 10 Recommendations for Exchange of 
Terrain Data 

Executive	  Summary	  
Introduction 

This document provides recommendations for the exchange of terrain data for 
aviation purposes. A main focus point is the identification of terrain formats that 
comply with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ requirements for the representation of terrain 
data. All ICAO member states need to provide chart, terrain and obstacle data in an 
electronic form, fully relying on the ISO 19100 series of geographic information 
standards. One important challenge for the terrain data provision is to overcome 
cross-border differences due to differences in national geodetic systems, a topic which 
is also investigated. Finally, guidance is offered to provide web-based access to 
terrain data, in an INSPIRE-compliant way. 

Background information 

Since the birth of civil aviation in the first part of the 20th century, the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been defining standards and recommended 
practices concerning civil aviation. One important aspect is the gathering, 
management and publication of aeronautical information, governed by the ICAO 
Annex 15 standard. Its 12th and most recent edition defines that all members need to 
provide chart, terrain and obstacle data in an electronic form, relying on the ISO 
19100 series of geographic information standards.  

To achieve interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management Network 
(EATMN) upon adopting ICAO Annex 15 edition 12, the European Commission 
(EC) mandated Eurocontrol in 2005 to assist the EC in the development of an 
interoperability implementing rule on Aeronautical Data and Information Quality. The 
purpose was to supplement and strengthen the requirements of ICAO Annex 15 in 
order to achieve aeronautical information of sufficient quality. This mandate resulted 
in the ADQ draft implementing rule, adopted by the EC in 2010, hereafter simply 
referred to by ADQ.  

To comply with the requirements for electronic chart and obstacle data, the AIXM 5.1 
format can be used today. For terrain data, there is no recommended format yet 
identified. This engineering report takes the requirements set forth by ICAO Annex 
15 and the derived ADQ as a basis to identify and evaluate a number of terrain 
formats. Specific attention is paid on the topic of cross-border elevation differences, 
which should be resolved to provide seamless terrain data to the user. 
Apart from aviation, the EC also launched an initiative to integrate and harmonize the 
representation and delivery of geographical information provided by its member 
states, called Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community or 
INSPIRE. When implemented, it will facilitate the discovering, accessing and sharing 
of public sector data in a much more standardized way allowing the sharing of 
information within public and private sector organizations and with the citizen. The 
INSPIRE initiative is part of the wider EU Digital Agenda for Europa / Europe 2020 
strategy, which sets out a vision for a digital Single Market to give people access to 
all the potential advantages of the digital society.

This engineer report investigates the possibilities for web-based access to terrain data 
in an INSPIRE compliant way. 

Recommendations / main conclusions 

This document analyzes and compares three potential formats for the exchange of 
terrain data: 

 TIXM 

 OGC GeoPackage  

 Elevation Surface Model (ESM)  

All three formats have their advantages and disadvantages. Important for this 
document is to verify their compliancy with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ, as well as 
some practical considerations when implementing them in industry-specific 
applications. 

In terms of metadata support, all three formats are compliant with ICAO Annex 15 
and ADQ. The TIXM format is being developed with a dedicated ISO 19115/19139 
metadata profile for terrain data. At the time of writing, this profile is not yet fully up 
to date, but it is assumed that this will be completed some time in the future. 

In terms of data representation, the three formats differ in their abilities. ESM is by far 
the most extensive format, with many options to represent elevation data. TIXM can 
act as a metadata wrapper for existing formats, or contain GML-based elevation data. 
OGC GeoPackage is the most mature format of the three, with high industry support 
behind it. While there are several advantages to using OGC GeoPackage as primary 
terrain exchange format (such as efficiency, ease-of-use, multi-leveling), it would 
require a few extensions to support elevation data, using the GeoPackage extension 
mechanism. 

In terms of distribution, an OGC WCS service is considered the most suitable for all 
three formats. A WCS service has specific parameters that apply to exchanging grid 
coverages (e.g., resolution, interpolation, subset). All three formats can be served 
using an OGC WCS service. As an alternative, an OGC WMTS service can also be 
used to distribute multi-leveled, tiled data. This has its advantages as it allows for 
more fine-grained request for smaller sets of data. Note that OGC WMTS can also be 
used in combination with OGC WCS, where the WCS service acts as a data provider, 
and OGC WMTS service acts as a portrayal service. 

From an industry adoption point of view, there are some other considerations to be 
made: Selective decoding, aggregate data and sparseness. Selective decoding allows 
efficient use of a subset of the data, aggregate data allows trading accuracy for 
performance when interactivity is desired and sparseness helps reducing bandwidth 
usage, application memory and processing requirements. The OGC GeoPackage 
format was built to consider all of these aspects, and as such, it is quite suitable for the 
purposes of terrain exchange. TIXM and ESM do however have the capability to 
reference an external file that also takes advantage of selective decoding, aggregate 
data and sparseness. (For instance: DTED, GeoTIFF, NITF…) 

On the topic of providing seamless terrain data to the user, while avoiding potential 
cross-border elevation differences, three approaches have been investigated: 

1. Processing of terrain data by a central authority 



2. Consolidate a fixed terrain grid across multiple states 

3. Shift responsibility to clients to merge different datasets 

No clear recommendation can be made here; all approaches have advantages and 
disadvantages, which should be evaluated by all stakeholders to decide on a particular 
approach. 

Finally, this document focusses on the requirements of the European INSPIRE 
initiative. INSPIRE recommends the following things: 

1. A grid representation of the data should be offered 

2. Use of a common grid based on ETRS89 coordinates 

3. Use of EVRS vertical datum to express gravity-related heights 

4. The use of GML or TIFF is recommended for grid-based elevation data. 

5. Use of OGC WCS 2.0 web service to exchange terrain data. 

6. Use of OGC WMS 1.3.0 or WMTS 1.0 for portrayal, together with OGC 
Symbology Encoding for the styling of data. 

Apart from point 4, all investigated formats conform to the recommendations given 
by INSPIRE. To comply with point 4 (The use of GML or TIFF data), it is 
recommended to use TIXM file format as an exchange format for terrain data.

OGC® Testbed 10 Recommendations for Exchange of 
Terrain Data 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC® document describes the recommendations for the exchange of Terrain 
Data for the Aviation Thread of Testbed 10. The specific requirements of Testbed-10 
Aviation Terrain Data Exchange are focused around the analysis of existing and new 
terrain data formats, and their compliance to existing standards and requirements. 
This document includes: 

 Identification of possible formats of the exchange of terrain dataset compliant 
with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ requirements. 

 Identification of possible ways to overcome cross-border differences in terrain 
data due to differences in national geodetic systems and provision of seamless 
terrain data. 

 Identification of possibilities of web-based access to eTOD data in an 
INSPIRE compliant way. 

While the subject of electronic Terrain and Obstacle data (eTOD) is touched, it is 
outside of the scope of this report to analyze Obstacle data. This report focuses on 
Terrain data.

1.3 Future work 

Improvements in this document are desirable to the following topics. 

 Investigation of required terrain sizes & impact on format scalability. ICAO 
Annex 15 defines the areas for which terrain needs to be provided; this should 
be taken as a basis to determine the elevation data size. 



 Investigation of the suitability of aggregate data and possible requirements in 
this area. For instance, an aggregate function is typically the average, but 
others might be needed (e.g., maximum).

4 Overview of Terrain Data Exchange Requirements for Aviation 

The subject of Exchange of Terrain Data has been left untouched in previous OGC® 
testbeds. Terrain Data is an important component for the future electronic Terrain and 
Obstacle Data (eTOD). Obstacle data is often modeled with a dependency on its 
underlying Terrain Data. For instance: Vertical structures that have a height, defined 
as “meters above terrain”. When looking at air traffic routes for aerodromes in the 
vicinity of mountainous areas, it is essential that Terrain Data can be retrieved for 
analysis.  



The ADQ Draft Implementing Rule, described in Commission Regulation (EU) No 
73/2010 [1], states the importance of electronic Terrain Data: 

A significant amount of paper-based, manual activity still takes place within the 
aeronautical data chain, which leads to significant opportunities for the 
introduction of errors and the degradation of data quality. …In accordance with 
the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 552/2004, aeronautical information 
should be provided progressively in an electronic form, based on a commonly 
agreed and standardised data set. 

While classical Terrain Data formats (such as DTED) can be used in existing OGC® 
Services (such as OGC® WCS), it is found that they are often limiting in their 
capabilities, especially when it comes to representing metadata. The requirement for 
metadata is becoming increasingly important, and we will stress this point throughout 
the report. 

In this Engineering Report we focus on identifying and analyzing possible Data 
Formats for the exchange of Terrain Data. For each of the identified Data Formats, we 
analyze them in the context of a set of requirements and considerations: 

 Compliance with ICAO Annex 15 [2]  

 Compliance with ADQ 

 Support for metadata (ISO 19115) 

 Support for usage in OGC Services 

 Industry adoption potential 

 Completeness 

 Scalability 

Data coverage requirement: sets of electronic terrain and obstacle data shall be 
collected and recorded in databases in accordance with the following coverage areas: 
 

 Area 1: entire territory of a state 

 Area 2: terminal control area 

 Area 3: aerodrome / heliport area 

 Area 4: Category II or III operations  

A visual example of some of these areas for Geneva International Airport is given in 
figure 1.

The recommended resolution and accuracy values per coverage level can be seen in 
figure 2. 

 

Figure 2 - Recommended resolution and accuracy values per coverage level (ICAO Annex 15) 

 

To model these figures and present them correctly and with confidence to a client, we 
also need a way of defining metadata for Terrain Data. According to the ICAO Annex 
15 and its derived ADQ requirements, the metadata for Terrain Data should include 
(at the very least) the following items: 

1. The data originator of the data 

2. Amendments made to the data 

3. The persons or organizations that have interacted with the data and when 



4. Details of any validation and verification of the data that has been performed 

5. Effective start date and time of the data 

6. For geospatial data: 

a. The earth reference model used 

b. The coordinate system used 

7. For numerical data 

a. The statistical accuracy of the measurement 

b. The resolution 

c. The confidence level 

8. Details of any functions applied if data has been subject to 
conversion/transformation 

9. Details of any limitations on the use of data. 

Apart from that, we also examine the problem of cross-border differences between 
Terrain Data, and generate a set of recommendations for how these problems can be 
addressed. 

Finally, the possibilities for web-based access to eTOD (terrain) data in an INSPIRE-
compliant way are being investigated. 

5 Examined Terrain Data formats 

For this study we have examined and compared 3 Terrain Data formats: 

 Terrain Data Exchange Model (TIXM) 

 OGC® GeoPackage 

 Elevation Surface Model (ESM) 

5.1 TIXM 

5.1.1 Introduction 

The Terrain Data Exchange Model (TIXM) is an Extensible Mark-up Language 
(XML) Schema implementation of the Terrain Data Conceptual Model (TICM). Both 
TICM and TIXM are being developed by Eurocontrol with the purpose of having a 
Terrain specific data format that is compliant with requirements of ICAO Annex 15. 
The schema for TIXM can be found attached in Annex A. 

The TIXM Exchange Model is analogous to the Aeronautical Information Exchange 
Model (AIXM), with the difference that it is applies to a different domain within 
Aviation. Both formats make use of Geography Markup Language (GML) to model 
geometry, and both offer a way to model relevant metadata according to ISO 19115.

5.1.2 Data 

There are two core ways to use the TIXM schema: 

 As a metadata wrapper around existent Terrain Data 

 As a self-containing set of GML 3.2 points, next to its metadata 

5.1.2.1 External Reference 

In the first case, common Terrain Data files are linked through with the gml:fileName 
element. This element can be any URI. The MIME-type of the resulting binary data 
block can also be specified. Example of a link to an external DTED file: 

<gml:rangeSet> 
    <gml:fileName>http://www.somedata.org/terrain.dt0</gml:fileName> 
    <gml:fileStructure>Record Interleaved</gml:fileStructure> 
    <gml:mimeType>application/x-dted</gml:mimeType> 
</gml:rangeSet> 
 

The external link has to be resolved separately from the TIXM file. This could be 
done asynchronously by software applications (i.e., in a background process) and only 
when needed in order to reduce bandwidth. The TIXM file contains metadata 
regarding the geographical extent and data density, so this decision can be made 
without the external data. 

Using a TIXM file to refer to external binary data files means that readily available 
Terrain Data formats can be re-used by clients that support them. It also means that on 
top of GML 3.2 and XML support, clients will have to implement support for a set of 
well-known raster formats.  

5.1.2.2 Inline Data 

TIXM also allows you to inline elevation data straight into the file, making it a stand-
alone terrain format. For instance, elevation data can be encoded using a string of 
tuples: 

<gml:rangeSet> 
    <gml:DataBlock> 
        <gml:rangeParameters/> 
        <gml:tupleList>10.0 10.0 130.0, 10.0 11.0 135.0, 10.0 12.0 
132.0</gml:tupleList> 
    </gml:DataBlock> 
</gml:rangeSet> 
 

Alternatively, more descriptive geometry can also be used instead of a simple list of 
tuples. The TIXM schema defines tixm:ElevatedPoint geometry type. This type 
contains (apart from an elevation) some metadata to describe the elevated point itself: 

<complexType name="ElevatedPointType"> 
        <sequence> 
            <element name="elevation" 
                     type="tixm:ValDistanceVerticalTypePropertyType"/> 



            <element name="height" 
                     type="tixm:ValDistanceVerticalTypePropertyType"/> 
            <element name="source" 
                     type="tixm:AcquistionMethodType"/> 
            <element name="surfaceType" 
                     type="tixm:SurfaceType"/> 
            <element name="surfaceTypeDescription" 
                     type="string"/> 
            <element name="recordedSurface" 
                     type="string"/> 
            <element name="penetrationLevel" 
                     type="tixm:ValDistanceVerticalTypePropertyType" minOccurs="0"/> 
            <element name="knownVariations" type="string" 
                     minOccurs="0"/> 
            <element name="maximumHeight" 
                     type="tixm:ValDistanceVerticalTypePropertyType" minOccurs="0"/> 
            <element name="survey" 
                     type="tixm:SurveySetPropertyType"/> 
        </sequence> 
    </complexType> 
 

The use of inline XML to define points has the advantage that is easier for a client to 
implement (no additional Terrain Data Format support is required). The disadvantage 
is that the entire block of elevation data has to be downloaded together with the 
surrounding metadata. This could potentially be performance problem when applied 
on a large scale. 

5.1.3 Metadata 

The biggest advantage of TIXM over other formats is the availability of a set of 
metadata properties that are directly based on ICAO Annex 15 & ADQ metadata 
requirements. It should be noted however that this metadata work is still a work in 
progress, and thus not completely representable for the final result. The intent is to 
specify a terrain data profile as an extension of ISO 19115 / 19139. At the time of 
writing this activity was not yet complete. 

5.2 GeoPackage 

5.2.1 Introduction 

GeoPackage is an SQLite-based database file that is currently being developed by the 
OGC® GeoPackage SWG. It was originally intended as a mobile raster and vector 
exchange format, but it can have its uses on desktop clients and servers as well.  

The GeoPackage specification defines an SQL database schema. The objective of the 
format is to have a self-contained, single-file, cross-platform, serverless, transactional, 
open source RDBMS container [3]. 

5.2.2 Data 

While GeoPackage supports both vector and raster data, we only focus on the raster 
aspect in this engineering report. 

The GeoPackage format has support for a tile-based pyramid raster dataset. The 
pyramid structure allows you to predefine multi-leveling and level-of-detail (LOD) 



Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

right into the format. Tiles can currently be encoded as PNG or JPEG. Other formats 
can be used as well, given that their MIME-type is recognized by the client as an 
extension. 

While the current GeoPackage version (1.0) does not implicitly add support for 
elevation data, it could be added with one or more extensions to the basic format. 
Extensions are part of the GeoPackage specification. The first version of the 
GeoPackage specification has some optional extensions that might be needed to 
correctly analyze and visualize data. 

To make GeoPackage compatible with elevation data, two main components need to 
be extended. 

First, the currently raster tile formats (PNG and JPEG) are limited to Red-Green-Blue 
(RGB) pixels. Elevation data requires integer or floating point values for each pixel. 
To accommodate this, GeoPackage could be extended to support a file format that 
does support floating point images. An example of this would be the TIFF format.  

Secondly, there needs to be an extension so that you can make the distinction between 
color-based tiles and elevation-based tiles. Right now, the base assumption is that all 
tiles are color-based. An extension could be added to GeoPackage to allow certain 
tiles or tile-pyramids to be “tagged” as containing elevation data instead of color data. 

Elevation data would also require a way of defining the vertical reference. For this we 
recommend the usage of compound EPSG-codes inside the GeoPackage file to 
declare both the horizontal and vertical reference. This would require no change to the 
GeoPackage specification. 

5.2.3 Metadata 

Apart from raster data, GeoPackage also has built in support for auxiliary metadata 
through its gpkg_metadata table. This can be used to add ISO 19115 metadata, 
encoded as XML (according to ISO 19139). Alternatively, a different metadata 
scheme such as TIXM could be used; as described in 5.1.3, a future version of TIXM 
will most likely also rely on ISO 19115. 

GeoPackage offers flexibility for the granularity of the metadata: It can be defined for 
each pyramid structure, or even per tile. This allows multiple levels of detail, where 
each of the levels not only defines a higher resolution area, but also different 
horizontal and vertical accuracies. The benefit with this approach is that a single 
GeoPackage file can describe the various accuracy and confidence levels for all of its 
tiles, without the need to wrap the tiles in separate files. 

A small part of the GeoPackage metadata can be queried straight from the SQLite 
data without parsing any XML. This small subset of metadata represents the bare 
minimum metadata for tiles and pyramid structures so they can be visualized correctly 
without parsing any XML (and thus increasing the complexity of a potential client). 

It should be noted however that to comply with ADQ recommendations, ISO 19139-
encoded XML metadata needs to be included in GeoPackage. The basic metadata 
available through SQLite calls alone is not enough.

5.3 Elevation Surface Model 

5.3.1 Introduction 

Elevation Surface Model (ESM) is a Terrain Exchange Standard currently being 
developed by the Defense Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG) [4]. The 
specification builds on the ISO 19123 standard for Terrain Coverage. 

5.3.2 Data 

ESM can contain Terrain Data in 4 different formats: 

 Grid Coverage 

 TIN Coverage 

 Point Coverage 

 Point-Cloud 



Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

5.3.2.1 Grid Coverage 

 

Figure 5 - Example of a grid coverage 

 

A grid coverage in ESM refers to pre-defined grid in which elevation points are 
stored. Once the grid has been defined, elevation values are defined as an array of 
elevation values. The index or the elevation determines its location in the grid. This 
allows for a very efficient compression to be applied. A grid also defines its 
interpolation value between grid-points 

5.3.2.2 TIN Coverage 

 

Figure 6 - Example of a TIN coverage 

 

A TIN coverage in ESM defines a terrain through a series of connected triangles. The 
edges of the triangles are all geospatially referenced. A TIN-Coverage has the 
advantage of easily and efficiently being visualized in 3D environments. The 
disadvantage of working with this type of data is that it is often more difficult to use 
in analysis. The edges of a triangle are not necessarily aligned in a grid, which means 
that obtaining elevation values for examination requires an advanced client capable of 
going through a large number of points to interpolate a single elevation value. 

5.3.2.3 Point Coverage 

A point coverage is an unstructured set of points, each with one or more elevation 
values assigned as attribute values. The arrangement of the points depends upon the 
characteristics of the sensor or process by which they were generated. Typically, 
further processing is necessary to use this data in an application. 



5.3.2.4 Point Cloud 

A point cloud is a set of points. This is usually the output of sensor data, such as a 
LiDaR sensor. This special case of data representation is not a coverage, and further 
processing will need to be done (such as adding metadata) to be usable in an 
application. 

5.3.3 Metadata 

ESM mandates that all metadata is encoded using an XML file that is in compliance 
with the metadata encoding rules described in ISO 19139. The metadata elements are 
derived from ISO 19115 and requirements set by the DGIWG Metadata Foundation 
(DMF). 

An overview of all available metadata elements can be found in Annex C. The 
metadata elements fully cover the requirements set by ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ. 
Annex C gives a good overview of the complex nature of the ESM metadata model. 

On top of the elements defined in Annex C, ESM also allows inclusion of additional 
metadata elements. The rules for creating extensions are described in the DMF. 

Apart from the metadata elements itself, ESM also defines a metadata hierarchy. At 
the highest level exists the metadata that is relevant for the entire dataset. Additional 
metadata elements can be added or overridden at lower levels. This allows specific 
elements of the ESM model (such as high-resolution tiles) to supersede their less 
detailed counter-parts at a higher level.  

5.4 Comparison 

5.4.1 Compliance with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ 

Compliance with ICAO Annex 15 and its European derivative ADQ is considered as 
one of the primary requirements for a candidate terrain exchange format for aviation. 

The following requirements can be considered relevant for the choice of a data 
format: 

1. Data set specifications: terrain data shall include a number of metadata items 
(see section 4), so the format should provide the means to define this 
metadata. All evaluated formats provide these capabilities; the following 
section discusses this topic in more detail. 

2. Data exchange format requirements: terrain data shall be expressed using a 
common format compliant with a specific list of ISO standards, including ISO 
19107 (general document, spatial characteristics for geographic data, used by 
GML etc.), ISO 19115 (metadata model in UML), ISO 19139 (XML encoding 
of ISO 19115), ISO 19118 (UML modeling & XML schema conversion) and 
ISO 19136 (GML). Although not all evaluated formats directly use some of 
these standards (e.g., TIXM in its current form does not yet rely on ISO 19115 
or GeoPackage does not directly depend on GML), there are no compliancy 
issues identified. 

3. Data quality requirements: all surveyed data shall be referenced to WGS 84; 
additionally, a geoid model shall be used in order that all vertical data 
(surveyed, calculated or derived) may be expressed relative to mean sea level 
via the Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) 1996. EGM 1996 is used by default 



Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

by WGS 84, which is probably the most commonly used geodetic reference 
systems. All formats support representing data in this system. 

4. Data protection requirements: all data transformed in an electronic format 
shall be protected against loss of alteration of data by the application of the 
CRC32Q algorithm. None of the evaluated formats provide explicit 
capabilities for this; however, one approach could be to embed a CRC in the 
metadata – for instance, through an extension of ISO 15115 / 19139. With this 
approach, all evaluated formats are considered to be compliant with the 
requirement. 

5.4.2 Support for metadata (ISO 19115) 

Good metadata is necessary for a format to comply with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ. 
One of the main requirements is the use of ISO 19115 / 19139. 

The TIXM format is mostly a metadata format. The metadata definition is an activity 
that is still underway so no definite statement can be made. It is the intent to specify a 
terrain data profile as an extension of ISO 19115 / 19139 which would fit the 
requirements. Additionally, since a TIXM file can refer to an external file and because 
many common formats (e.g., GeoTIFF) are multi-leveled, it would be desirable to 
have some metadata in this regard. For instance, less detailed levels may be derived 
from more detailed data using by taking an average or a maximum. 

GeoPackage supports any type of auxiliary metadata. This can for example be used to 
embed the metadata that will be defined for TIXM. This metadata can apply to either 
the entire data set or a subset of tiles. Since the auxiliary metadata is optional it would 
be necessary to specify additional requirements for GeoPackage files with terrain data 
in the aviation context. 

Similar to GeoPackage, ESM allows metadata for the entire data set and a subset of 
tiles. The metadata elements (see Annex C) defined in the Elevation Surface Model 
are based on ISO 19115 and DMF requirements. They fully support ICAO Annex 15 
and ADQ requirements in terms of the content of metadata. ESM also mandates the 
use of ISO 19139 compliant XML to encode the metadata. 

5.4.3 Support for usage in OGC services 

The OGC web service standards such as WFS, WCS, WMS and WMTS offer an 
open, standardized and interoperable way to distribute geographical data and are 
widely adopted by the industry. Integration of the terrain formats into these services is 
therefore considered as important for the distribution of terrain data. 

For the distribution of elevation data, an OGC WCS service seems the most 
promising. It is specifically designed for the exchange of gridded coverages, and 
offers numerous parameters to configure this (e.g., resolution, interpolation, defining 
a subset, etc.). Although GeoTIFF is defined as default exchange format for the WCS, 
any other format can be plugged in, including TIXM, GeoPackage or ESM. For a 
TIXM file with external data, a multi-part response is required since both the 
metadata and the external file need to be communicated. A GeoPackage file on the 
other hand is fully self-contained so distribution is easy. Data in the DGIWG ESM 
standard could also be used with a WCS, similar to TIXM data. 

For the portrayal of elevation data, both a WMS and a WMTS can be of use, and both 
services can be backed by any data format in practice.  



Finally, a TIXM file with embedded data fits naturally with an OGC WFS due to its 
GML nature. However, an OGC WFS is primarily designed for the exchange of 
vector features and not for gridded coverage data; also, none of the evaluated formats 
support a vector representation of elevation data (e.g., contour lines), so we  primarily 
focus on a WCS for this topic. 

5.4.4 Completeness 

Depending on the use case different data representations may be more suitable. A 
point cloud is more suitable for storage of the raw surveyed terrain data since it leaves 
the data unmodified. Applications that process, analyze or use terrain data in general 
on the other hand typically work most efficiently with grids due to their regular 
nature. 

The TIXM format supports both point clouds and grids. Similarly the GeoPackage 
format also supports point clouds and grids. However, a new extension is needed to 
add support for elevation data. Adding such an extension such not pose any problems 
and has already been investigated by the OGC GeoPackage SWG and in OGC OWS-
9. The DGIWG ESM standard is more comprehensive: it also supports TIN's in 
addition to point clouds and grids. 

5.4.5 Scalability 

In case of large data sets, efficient decoding and handling is crucial for scalability. 
This requires support for selective decoding (tiling) of data and availability of 
aggregate data (multi-leveling): 

 Selective decoding ensures that the memory and processing for applications is 
proportional to the working set instead of the entire data set. As an example, 
take an image of 10k x 10k pixels. Reading a block of 256x256 pixels from 
this image would require decoding ~2.5M pixels if the data is stored in 
scanline order compared to ~65k pixels for the case where the image is tiled. 

 Availability of aggregate data allows applications to efficiently operate on 
both small and large portions of the data set. This allows trading accuracy for 
speed as needed. It enables a user to get a quick overview based on aggregate 
data and to subsequently launch highly accurate processing on a region of 
interest. As an example, take again an image of 10k x 10k pixels. If a user 
wants to do a quick analysis on the entire data set, this would require 
processing 100M pixels. However, if a smaller thumbnail of 1k x 1k is 
available, the application can use this to provide faster feedback at reduced 
accuracy. A common approach is to store multiple levels of detail of the data 
in the file where each version is half the size in each direction compared to the 
previous. Typically this increases the file size by about 1/3 but greatly 
increases the possibilities in an application.  

A common approach is to use a combination of tiling and multi-leveling, such as in 
OGC WMTS and GeoPackage. 

A second factor is support for sparse data sets, meaning that some areas may contain 
more detailed data than others. This is especially relevant for data sets covering a 
large area. Somewhat related to this: the file format itself can also limit the maximum 
data set size. 

The embedded terrain data support provided by TIXM is not suitable for large terrain 
data sets: XML data is large compared to typical raster formats and does not allow 
efficiently decoding a particular subset. Consequently, it is only suitable for small 



Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

data sets or as an intermediate format. A TIXM file can also refer to an external data 
file so scalability can be obtained by selecting a good external format. A good 
example is GeoTIFF, a widely accepted format. 

Support for tiling, multi-leveling and sparseness is an integral part of the GeoPackage 
format. Since it is backed by a database, retrieving a subset of the data is very 
efficient. From a technical point of view, a GeoPackage database is limited to 140TB; 
however, it still remains to be tested what the practical upper limit is. Current 
scalability tests only used data sets of up to a few 100's of GB. 

The ESM standard also allows external data files so similar to TIXM this format. 
Some suggested formats are GeoTIFF, DTED, NITF and JPEG2000, which all 
support both selective decoding and aggregate data and would hence be considered 
scalable. 

5.4.6 Industry adoption potential 

Industry adoption depends on the effort all parties need to invest into using the 
format. For software component developers, important factors are the data encoding 
and complexity of the data representation. For the encoding, re-use of widely support 
file formats reduces the effort significantly. For the data representation, regular data 
structures such as grids are typically easier to support than irregular data structures 
such as triangle networks and point clouds. For data providers, an important factor is 
the integration with existing data. 

TIXM is a new format but its schema is relatively simple and reuses many elements 
from GML which is a widely accepted format. More work is currently under way to 
define a more complete profile so this could change in the final version. A TIXM file 
can refer to existing terrain data so there is no need to translate existing data. Because 
of this, the adoption cost for both the data provider and software component providers 
is relatively low. However, since any format can be used to represent the actual data 
there is a risk for fragmentation. Each software component provider may support a 
different set of formats for the external data which may severely limit the 
interoperability in practice or even make it impossible in the case of proprietary 
formats. 

The GeoPackage format is already a widely accepted OGC standard. Numerous 
commercial and open-source software components (GDAL, Luciad’s open-source 
libgpkg library …) already support the standard. Consequently, software component 
providers should have little effort adopting it for terrain data as well. Allowing terrain 
data as point clouds is possible but will face slow adoption due to the complexity of 
handling irregular data. On the other hand data providers will need to translate 
existing data into the new format. 

The ESM standard is very comprehensive but also complex. For instance, data can be 
represented as a TIN. Integrating such data with other types of data such as obstacles 
efficiently is not straight forward due to its irregular nature. Another example is 
JPEG2000. While this is a flexible format regularly used in some industry domains 
(for instance, defense and medical) it poses a risk for industry adoption due to its 
complexity. As a result there are only a limited number of reliable implementations 
available, none of which are open source. Other elements such as the Morton ordering 
for values or tiles seem unnecessarily complex. Depending on the implementation 
data providers may also need to translate existing data. 



5.4.7 Conclusion 

5.4.7.1 Recommendations 

For the metadata, the definition of an ISO 19115 / 19139 profile specific for terrain 
data would satisfy the ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ requirements. This activity should 
be underway in the context of TIXM. From an application perspective, the following 
metadata would be recommended: 

 Metadata regarding the exact interpretation of a value/pixel: for example 
elevation, located at the corner of a grid. 

 Metadata regarding multi-leveling: for levels that are derived from others, 
which function is used (for example averaging or maximum) 

For the data representation, 2 important use cases can be identified. A first use case is 
the storage of the unprocessed measurement data. The unprocessed data is typically 
not used directly for analysis. Keeping this data is still important to generated gridded 
data with minimal loss of accuracy. For instance, when new measurement data is 
available for a part of a grid. Since such data is typically irregular, it requires support 
for point clouds in the format. The second use case is analysis. Typically, analysis 
applications prefer gridded data because it is a very efficient representation for a wide 
range of analysis algorithms. This is mostly due to its simple, regular structure. 
Another representation is a TIN. Such data is efficient for very specific cases (e.g., 3D 
visualization) but much more complex in many other cases (e.g., retrieving the value 
at a specific point) due to its irregular nature. 

Because terrain data sets can be large, the data format should support both selective 
decoding and aggregate data. The first allows efficient use of a subset and the latter 
allows trading accuracy for performance when interactivity is desired. The most 
widely accepted approach for this is the use of tiling and multi-leveling (e.g., WMTS 
and GeoTIFF). Another approach is the use of wavelet encoding such as in JPEG2000 
but these pose a risk for industry adoption due to their complexity. As a result, there 
are only a limited number of reliable implementations available, none of which are 
open source.  

For very large terrain data sets (e.g., multiple GB) support for sparse data in the data 
format is desirable. This can reduce both the bandwidth usage and application 
memory and processing requirements significantly. 

5.4.7.2 TIXM 

In general, given the metadata profile that is underway, the TIXM format would suit 
the requirements. However some improvements may be possible.  

Firstly, allowing terrain data embedded as XML does not seem very useful. To get 
reasonable bandwidth use, application performance and memory usage in practice, 
this is only feasible for very small data sets. Allowing this capability poses a risk 
since data can be created which cannot be handled efficiently. 

The use of external data links allows reusing existing data without modification. This 
makes adopting the format easy. However, since any format can be used to represent 
the actual data there is a risk for fragmentation. Each software component provider 
may support a different set of formats for the external data which may severely limit 
the interoperability in practice or even make it impossible in the case of proprietary 
formats. In addition it can also be used with formats that are not scalable. As such we 
recommend specifying a profile that indicates the allowed external formats. The 



Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

profile should also include the required structure of general formats. For example, the 
TIFF format can support any number of levels and image format. For this case, we 
should require tiled data and enough levels of detail to meet the scalability 
requirements. 

5.4.7.3 GeoPackage 

The use of GeoPackage for terrain data requires a new extension. Adding such an 
extension is supported by the format so this should not pose any problems. The same 
metadata as used in TIXM can be embedded in the GeoPackage file. However, 
GeoPackage offers a number of advantages compared to TIXM with an external data 
file: 

 It is already a widely accepted OGC standard. 

 It is a scalable format due to its support for tiling, multi-leveling and 
sparseness. 

 It is a single self-describing file which eases distribution. 

5.4.7.4 ESM 

From a high level the DGIWG ESM standard is similar to TIXM, also allowing both 
embedded and external data. However it suggests a number of complex features 
which pose a considerable risk for industry adoption: data representation using a TIN, 
specific tile ordering schemes and JPEG2000. 

6 Analysis of Cross-Border Differences in Terrain Data 

Today each state is responsible for the provision of terrain data for its territory. But 
rarely aviation customers are interested in obtaining data from separate states and then 
compiling it. For example, an aerodrome located near a country border requires data 
from both states. Consequently, of more interest is to obtain directly a regional (for 
example European) or global dataset. 

6.1 Creation 

Obtaining a seamless terrain for a large area inevitably requires integrating 
measurement data from different sources that does not line up perfectly with the 
desired terrain grid. Consequently, some processing on the measurements such as 
reference transformations, interpolation or combining of samples will be necessary in 
general. Each of these steps may result in some loss of accuracy. 

The desired processing steps depend on the context. For example, a maximum terrain 
surface (e.g., the actual terrain surface is always below it) is more useful when using 
the terrain itself as an obstacle, while mean values provide a better results for other 
applications such as visual inspection of on-terrain obstacles or line-of-sight 
computations. 

In addition access to lower resolution versions of the terrain data set is often also 
useful to allow trade-off between accuracy and performance. 

6.2 Approaches 

There are a number of ways to obtain a seamless terrain data set: 



1. Centralized: Collect measurement data from each state and select a central 
authority to integrate this into a seamless terrain data set 

2. Per state: Define the grid of the terrain data set and assign each node to one of 
the states 

3. Per client: Integrate data from each state on the client 

6.3 Centralized 

The desired area of the terrain data set is split up and each part is assigned to a state. 
Each state is then responsible for collecting data for the assigned area meeting all 
requirements (e.g., precision, resolution, updates ...). This data is gathered by a central 
authority which verifies and combines it into the desired seamless terrain data set(s). 

The accuracy requirements for the data measurements should be somewhat higher 
than the accuracy required by the seamless data set since the central authority will 
need to do some processing on it which typically reduces the accuracy. Individual 
states are also not required to process the data into a single grid since the central 
authority takes care of this. The provided data could for example be in the form of a 
point cloud (e.g. a disordered set of geographic locations and height measurement 
tuples). 

An important advantage of this approach is that it ensures all data is verified and 
processed in the same way. Since the central authority has all data available it can also 
easily compute aggregate sets (e.g., lower resolution versions of the data) or different 
variations (for example min/mean/max value). Overlap between the measurements of 
the different states does not pose any additional problems since it is handled naturally 
as a part of the processing by the central authority. 

6.4 Per state 

The states agree upon the grid and geographic reference of the seamless terrain. Each 
node of this grid is assigned to a single state. Each state is then responsible for 
collecting data for its assigned area and processing it to obtain the terrain height at 
each node.  

By using a pre-defined grid, the horizontal position of each node is clearly defined 
and the data from all states aligns perfectly. In addition, by assigning each node to 1 
state, we ensure that there is no problem of overlap or holes. Each client can load the 
required state data sets to form a seamless data set. This requires no processing or 
transformation on the client, so there is no risk of introducing inaccuracies. However, 
this approach does not ensure perfect alignment of the vertical position of the data of 
different states. Each state might do its own measurements or process the data in 
different ways. So the transition from one state's data to another can be visible (e.g., a 
'wall' at the border). This could be objectionable when the data is used for 
visualization. This does not introduce any problems when using the data for 
processing: since each state guarantees that its data satisfies the vertical accuracy 
requirements, the size of the discontinuity must also be small. For example, a vertical 
accuracy requirement of ±1m can result in a discontinuity of at most 2m. 

6.5 Per client 

Each state provides a terrain data set for its territory in a grid and geographic 
reference that it chooses. The client applications are responsible for integrating this 
data into a single seamless terrain. Holes can be avoided by enforcing some overlap 
between the data sets of different states.

This approach gives each client the freedom to process and transform the data in a 
form that it finds most suitable. Performing reference transformations and on-the-fly 
grid re-sampling should not pose any problems from a technological point of view. 
Computing aggregate data sets on the other hand is typically done in a preprocessing 
step. A potential risk of this approach is that clients are not familiar with the potential 
problems when processing data such as accuracy loss. For example, when performing 
a reference transformation the nodes in the target grid do not line up perfectly with the 
nodes in the source grid so some horizontal accuracy is lost. 

7 Analysis of Web-Based access to eTOD data in an INSPIRE compliant way 

7.1 Introduction 

INSPIRE or Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community is an 
initiative launched by the European Commission to integrate and harmonize the 
representation and delivery of geographical information provided by the member 
states. Its goal is to facilitate the discovering, accessing and sharing of public sector 
data in a much more standardized way allowing the sharing of information within 
public and private sector organizations and with the citizen. The INSPIRE initiative is 
part of the wider EU Digital Agenda for Europa / Europe 2020 strategy, which sets 
out a vision for a digital Single Market to give people access to all the potential 
advantages of the digital society. 

7.2 Relevance for the terrain data representation and access 

Elevation is one of the 34 spatial data themes identified within the INSPIRE Data 
Specifications [5]. It encompasses digital elevation models for land, ice and ocean 
surfaces both for terrestrial elevation and bathymetry, as well as shorelines.  

Two types of elevation models are identified: 

 A Digital Terrain Model (DTM), describing the bare surface of the land or sea 
floor,  

 A Digital Surface Model (DSM), describing the heights of the objects present on 
the surface (e.g., vegetation, man-made objects) 

The following paragraphs discuss the INSPIRE requirements & recommendations for 
the representation and delivery of elevation data in more detail [6]. 

7.3 Representing elevation data 

7.3.1 Spatial representation 

Three spatial representation methods are offered:  

 A grid representation, consisting of a coverage geometry & elevation values at the 
points of a rectified grid.  

 A vector representation, consisting of land elevation and bathymetry elements in 
the form of spot elevations, contour lines, as well as break lines. 

 A triangulated irregular network (TIN) representation, consisting of a collection 
of geometries (control points, break lines, stop lines). 



The widely used grid representation is considered as the only mandatory 
representation to be compliant with INSPIRE. All investigated candidate terrain 
formats support at least the grid representation. 

7.3.2 Coordinate reference system 

For Pan-European and cross-border purposes, it is recommended to use a common 
grid representation based on ETRS89 geodetic coordinates, while using real time re-
projection for display through view services. All investigated candidate terrain 
formats support the use of the ETRS89 geodetic coordinate system. 

7.3.3 Vertical datum 

Use the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) for the vertical component on 
land within continental Europe, and the Earth Gravitational Model (EGM Version 
2008) for other areas. All investigated candidate terrain formats support the use of the 
EVRS and EGM 2008 vertical datums. 

7.3.4 Data encoding 

Use GML or TIFF as encoding for gridded land-based elevation data; use GML or a BAG file 
for bathymetric elevation data. TIN data shall be encoded using GML TIN. Additionally, only 
compression methods are valid that do not lead to data loss. From the investigated candidate 
terrain formats, both TIXM, GeoPackage and ESM offer compatibility with this requirement: 

 TIXM directly relies on GML to describe elevation data; additionally, it can also link 
to an external file in the TIFF format for the actual data. 

 GeoPackage and ESM are not specifically tied to a data encoding. In GeoPackage, 
extensions can be easily defined that use TIXM, TIFF, or any encoding format of 
choice. 

7.4 Providing web-based access to elevation data 

To provide web-based access to elevation data in an INSPIRE-compliant manner, 
multiple approaches can be identified that differ in the way the data is delivered and 
represented. 

Providing access to geographical information over the network is described in the 
Network Services component, one of the five major components within INSPIRE. 
The Network Services component introduces a number of relevant services, including 
discovery services, view services, download services and transformation services. For 
each of these services, requirements and recommendations are defined to deploy them 
in an INSPIRE-compliant manner. 

Most relevant to provide web-based access to terrain data are the download, view and 
discovery services. The following paragraphs discuss these in more detail. 

7.4.1 Access via a download service 

Within INSPIRE, a download service enables users to download and access copies of 
spatial data sets, or parts of such sets. Following the INSPIRE requirements on 
elevation data representation, the data should at least be offered in a grid 
representation. Elevation data using this model is provided as continuous coverages. 
The coverage description is based on the OGC WCS 2.0 and ISO 19123 (Coverage 
geometry and functions) standards. 



Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Applied to the use case of accessing terrain data, multiple options are available to 
package the domain and range encoding of coverage data. One option put forward is 
the use of a two-part representation, following the multipart representation 
conformance class defined in GML Application Schema for Coverages [7]. With this 
approach, a binary file format can be used in the second part to efficiently encode the 
range while the first part can rely on GML to represent the domain, fully compliant 
with ISO 19123. For small datasets, GML might alternatively also be used for the 
range encoding.  The default binary encoding for the coverage range is TIFF, while 
the default GML encoding for the coverage domain (and optionally the range) is 
GML 3.2.1. 

In practice, these requirements perfectly map on the OGC WCS 2.0 web service 
standard. OGC WCS 2.0 is based upon the coverage standard ISO 19123 and already 
relies on the GML Application Schema for Coverages for its representation. Within 
the WCS, the description of the coverage domain is handled by the DescribeCoverage 
request. Users can execute this request for a given coverage ID. The response contains 
(amongst other metadata) a description of the coverage domain, relying on the GML 
Application Schema for Coverages. To retrieve the actual data of the range (i.e., the 
range encoding), the GetCoverage request is used. The default format for this 
encoding is GeoTIFF, which is in line with the default binary encoding defined by 
INSPIRE, but others can be used. In fact, all investigated terrain data formats in this 
document are considered to be compatible, because the only requirement is to be able 
to encode the coverage range; the coverage domain description is already handled by 
the WCS DescribeCoverage operation. 

7.4.2 Access via a view service 

INSPIRE defines a view service as a network service that can be used for portrayal of 
spatial data. This is modeled by layers that portray spatial object types, and associates 
styles that define their portrayal. A grid elevation coverage is considered as one 
spatial object type, and should be identified by a layer and style with the following 
characteristics: 

 Layer Name (identifier) = EL.GridCoverage 

 Layer Title (human-readable name) = Grid Coverage 

 Keywords = grid, coverage 

 Style = an OGC Symbology Encoding specifying a raster symbolizer that maps 
the elevation values onto colors (see Annex B). 

In practice, these requirements can be implemented by using the OGC WMS 1.3.0 or 
the OGC WMTS 1.0 web service standards. Both services offer portrayal capabilities 
to the user; the main difference is in the retrieval of the maps: WMTS is a tiling 
protocol and relies on tiling parameters (tile pyramid, row, level, column) to identify 
maps (tiles), whereas WMS expects a bounding box and resolution from the user to 
identify a map. If performance is key, OGC WMTS is the recommended standard to 
set up a view service. OGC WMS can be considered if more flexibility is needed: it 
allows users to request the data in any geographic reference (if supported by the 
server) together with user-defined styling (if the server supports the OGC SLD profile 
for WMS). 

Maps returned by a view service are typically encoded using a bitmap format. Taking 
into account the requirement for lossless compression of terrain data, a lossless image 



compression format such as PNG should be used. In practice, a view service will 
typically access terrain data use one of the candidate terrain data formats, either 
directly from files or from a download service as described in 7.4.1. 

7.4.3 Discovery service 

A key concept in the INSPIRE network services is the discovery service, enabling users to 
discover, browse and query data made available by the previously discussed services. Applied 
to the the use case of accessing terrain data, a discovery service could be used to discover 
which terrain data sets are made available and their quality characteristics.  

A practical implementation of a discovery service can be found in the OGC Catalogue 
Service 2.0.    

7.4.4 Updates 

INSPIRE also requires that member states provide updates of data on a regular basis.  
All updates should be made publicly available 6 months after the changes were 
applied to the source data set. 

8 Conclusion & recommendations 

This document provided an assessment of the exchange of terrain data sets, including 
an identification of possible formats, an identification of possible ways to overcome 
the cross-border differences in terrain data and an identification of possibilities for 
web-based access to terrain data in an INSPIRE compliant way. 

8.1 Terrain data formats 

The formats TIXM, OGC GeoPackage and ESM have been selected as candidate 
terrain exchange formats and evaluated on a number of criteria.  

All three formats can be considered as compliant with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ, but 
some formats offer more out-of-the-box capabilities to support their requirements. 
Specifically from the perspective of metadata requirements, the definition of an ISO 
19115 / 19139 profile specific for terrain data would be recommended; this activity 
should already be underway in the context of TIXM, a format specifically designed to 
comply with ICAO Annex 15 and ADQ. From an application perspective, additional 
metadata regarding the exact interpretation of a value / pixel and regarding the multi-
leveling structure is recommended. 

To distribute gridded elevation data, an OGC WCS service is considered most 
suitable, as it has specific parameters that apply to exchanging grid coverages (e.g., 
resolution, interpolation, defining a subset, etc.). Although GeoTIFF is defined as 
default exchange format for the WCS, any other format can be plugged in, including 
TIXM, GeoPackage or ESM. An OGC WMTS service is more suitable to make a 
gridded elevation data set available to applications since it typically provides better 
performance for many, fine-grained requests. 

From a completeness perspective, the ESM standard is considered to be the most 
comprehensive (grids, point clouds, and TINs), followed by TIXM (points clouds and 
grids) and then GeoPackage (points clouds and grids, but a new extension for 
elevation data is still to be added). From an application perspective, gridded data is 
generally preferred because it offers a very efficient representation for a wide range of 
analysis algorithms.

For optimal scalability, a terrain data format should preferably support selective 
decoding, aggregate data and sparseness.  Selective decoding allows efficient use of a 
subset of the data, aggregate data allows trading accuracy for performance when 
interactivity is desired and sparseness helps reducing bandwidth usage, application 
memory and processing requirements. On this topic, GeoPackage format is considered 
very promising. Being backed by a database, it offers direct support for selective 
decoding (through tiling), aggregate data (through multi-leveling) and sparseness. For 
TIXM and ESM, the capability to reference external data files also allows choosing a 
scalable elevation encoding format; the formats GeoTIFF, DTED and NITF are 
considered suitable for this use case, as they offer similar capabilities as GeoPackage. 

From an industry adoption potential, OGC GeoPackage is a clear winner. Although it 
is a relatively new OGC standard (early 2014), it is already supported (or will be in 
the near future) by numerous commercial and open-source software vendors. The 
TIXM format is not yet final, but it also has potential for quick adoption: the format is 
relatively simple and based on well-known and widely adopted standards such as 
GML, and it offers to reference existing data formats for terrain data encoding. The 
ESM standard is also still being developed; at the time of writing, it is the most 
comprehensive format but also the most complex, which poses a risk for industry 
adoption. 

8.2 Cross-border differences in terrain data 

An investigation has been performed on the topic of providing seamless terrain data to 
the user, avoiding potential cross-border elevation differences. Three approaches have 
been investigated: (1) processing of terrain data by a central authority, (2) the use of a 
fixed terrain grid across multiple states and (3) shifting the responsibility to the client 
applications to integrate the data of different states into a seamless terrain. No clear 
recommendation can be made here; all approaches have advantages and 
disadvantages, which should be evaluated by all stakeholders to decide on a particular 
approach. 

8.3 INSPIRE-compliant, web-based access to terrain data 

The main goal of the European INSPIRE initiative is to harmonize the representation 
and delivery of geographical information by the member states. Applied to terrain 
data, a number of requirements and recommendations are identified related to the 
representation and delivery of the data. 

For compliancy with INSPIRE, a grid representation should at least be offered, which 
is in line with the recommendations made in terrain format evaluation part. 
Furthermore, it is recommended to use a common grid based on ETRS89 geodetic 
coordinates for Pan-European and cross-border purposes. Additionally, the EVRS 
vertical datum needs to be used to express gravity-related heights; while ICAO Annex 
15 and ADQ dictate the use of EGM 2008, INSPIRE only recommends this for 
territories outside continental Europe. From the perspective of data encoding, GML or 
TIFF is recommended to be used for grid elevation data. Looking back to the 
evaluation of terrain formats, this would vote for the use of TIXM in combination 
with embedded terrain data in GML or a reference to TIFF (preferred for scalability 
reasons). 

To provide web-based access to terrain data, the OGC WCS 2.0 web service standard 
is recommended to be used. Within INSPIRE, the grid representation is based on the 
ISO 19123 coverage standard and OGC GML Application Schema for Coverages, the 
same building blocks on which the OGC WCS 2.0 web service standard is based. For 



the portrayal of data, the OGC WMS 1.3.0 and WMTS 1.0 web services standards are 
recommended, together with OGC Symbology Encoding for the styling of the data. 
INSPIRE defines a number of predefined styles for the portrayal of data; Annex B 
includes the style to be used for gridded elevation data.
