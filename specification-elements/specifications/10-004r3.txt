Foreword 

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies 
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO 
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been 
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and 
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the 
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. 

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. 

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards 
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an 
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. 

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent 
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 

ISO 19156 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 211, Geographic information/Geomatics, in 
collaboration with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

Introduction 

This International Standard arises from work originally undertaken through the Open Geospatial Consortium’s 
Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) activity. SWE is concerned with establishing interfaces and protocols that will 
enable a “Sensor Web” through which applications and services will be able to access sensors of all types, 
and observations generated by them, over the Web. SWE has defined, prototyped and tested several 
components needed for a Sensor Web, namely: 

— Sensor Model Language (SensorML). 

— Observations & Measurements (O&M). 

— Sensor Observation Service (SOS). 

— Sensor Planning Service (SPS). 

— Sensor Alert Service (SAS). 

This International Standard specifies the Observations and Measurements schema, including a schema for 
sampling features. 

The content presented here derives from an earlier version published by Open Geospatial Consortium as 
OGC 07-022r1, Observations and Measurements — Part 1 — Observation schema and OGC 07-002r3, 
Observations and Measurements — Part 2 — Sampling Features. A technical note describing the changes 
from the earlier version is available from the Open Geospatial Consortium (see 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om).

Geographic information — Observations and measurements 

1 Scope 

This International Standard defines a conceptual schema for observations, and for features involved in 
sampling when making observations. These provide models for the exchange of information describing 
observation acts and their results, both within and between different scientific and technical communities. 

Observations commonly involve sampling of an ultimate feature-of-interest. This International Standard 
defines a common set of sampling feature types classified primarily by topological dimension, as well as 
samples for ex-situ observations. The schema includes relationships between sampling features (sub-
sampling, derived samples). 

This International Standard concerns only externally visible interfaces and places no restriction on the 
underlying implementations other than what is needed to satisfy the interface specifications in the actual 
situation. 

2 Conformance 

2.1 Overview 

Clauses 7 to 11 of this International Standard use the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to present 
conceptual schemas for describing Observations. These schemas define conceptual classes that  

a) may be considered to comprise a cross-domain application schema, or  

b) may be used in application schemas, profiles and implementation specifications. 

This flexibility is controlled by a set of UML types that can be implemented in a variety of manners. Use of 
alternative names that are more familiar in a particular application is acceptable, provided that there is a one-
to-one mapping to classes and properties in this International Standard. 

The UML model in this International Standard defines conceptual classes; various software systems define 
implementation classes or data structures. All of these reference the same information content. The same 
name may be used in implementations as in the model, so that types defined in the UML model may be used 
directly in application schemas. 

Annex A defines a set of conformance tests that will support applications whose requirements range from the 
minimum necessary to define data structures to full object implementation.

2.2 Conformance classes related to Application Schemas including Observations and 
Measurements 

The conformance rules for Application Schemas in general are described in ISO 19109:2005. Application 
Schemas also claiming conformance to this International Standard shall also conform to the rules specified in 
Clauses 7 to 11 and pass all relevant test cases of the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A. 

Depending on the characteristics of an Application Schema, 18 conformance classes are distinguished. 
Table 1 lists these classes and the corresponding subclause of the Abstract Test Suite.

5.2 Schema language 

The conceptual schema specified in this International Standard is in accordance with the Unified Modelling 
Language (UML) ISO/IEC 19501, following the guidance of ISO/TS 19103. 

The UML is conformant with the profile described in ISO 19136:2007, Annex E. Use of this restricted idiom 
supports direct transformation into a GML Application Schema. ISO 19136 introduces some additional 
stereotypes. In particular «FeatureType» implies that a class is an instance of the «metaclass» 
GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109), and therefore represents a feature type. 

The prose explanation of the model uses the term “property” to refer to both class attributes and association 
roles. This is consistent with the General Feature Model described in ISO 19109. In the context of properties, 
the term “value” refers to either a literal (for attributes whose type is simple), or to an instance of the class 
providing the type of the attribute or target of the association. Within the explanation, the property names 
(property types) are sometimes used as natural language words where this assists in constructing a readable 
text. 

5.3 Model element names 

This International Standard specifies a model for observations using terminology that is based on current 
practice in a variety of scientific and technical disciplines. It is designed to apply across disciplines, so the best 
or "most neutral" term has been used in naming the classes, attributes and associations provided. The 
terminology does not, however, correspond precisely with any single discipline. As an aid to implementors, a 
mapping from the element names specified in this International Standard to common terminology in some 
application domains is provided in Annex B. 

6 Dependencies 

Some model elements used in the schema described in Clauses 7 to 11 are defined in other International 
Standards. By convention within ISO/TC 211, names of UML classes, with the exception of basic data type 
classes, include a two or three letter prefix that identifies the International Standard and the UML package in 
which the class is defined. Table 2 lists the standards and packages in which UML classes used in this 
International Standard have been defined. UML classes defined in this International Standard have the prefix 
of CVT, GFI, OM and SF. The prefix GFI is used for classes defined in this International Standard, but which 
are associated with the GF package in ISO 19109. The prefix CVT is used for classes defined in this 
International Standard, but which are associated with the CV package in ISO 19123:2005.

7 Fundamental characteristics of observations 

7.1 The context for observations 

7.1.1 Property evaluation 

Properties of a feature fall into two basic categories: 

a) Value (e.g. name, price, legal boundary) assigned by some authority. These are exact. 

b) Value (e.g. height, classification, colour) determined by application of an observation procedure. These 
are estimates, with a finite error associated with the value. 

The observation error typically has a systematic component, which is similar for all estimates made using the 
same procedure, and a random component, associated with the particular application instance of the 
observation procedure. If potential errors in a property value are important in the context of a data analysis or 
processing application, then the details of the act of observation which provided the estimate of the value are 
required. 

7.1.2 Observation 

An observation is an act associated with a discrete time instant or period through which a number, term or 
other symbol is assigned to a phenomenon [2]. It involves application of a specified procedure, such as a 
sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain. The procedure may be applied in-situ, remotely, or ex-situ with 
respect to the sampling location. The result of an observation is an estimate of the value of a property of some 
feature. Use of a common model allows observation data using different procedures to be combined 
unambiguously. 

The observation itself is also a feature, since it has properties and identity. 

Observation details are important for data discovery and for data quality estimation. 

The observation could be considered to carry “property-level” instance metadata, which complements the 
dataset-level and feature-level metadata that have been conventionally considered (e.g. ISO 19115). 

NOTE ISO 19115-2:2009 provides MI_Event, which plays a similar role to OM_Observation in the context of image 
capture. 

7.1.3 Observation properties 

An observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of a 
feature, the latter being the feature-of-interest of the observation. The observation uses a procedure, which is 
often an instrument or sensor [1][2], but may be a process chain, human observer, an algorithm, a computation 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

8 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

or simulator. The key idea is that the observation result is an estimate of the value of some property of the 
feature-of-interest, and the other observation properties provide context or metadata to support evaluation, 
interpretation and use of the result. 

The relationship between the properties of an observation and those of its feature-of-interest is key to the 
semantics of the model. This is further elaborated in D.3. 

7.1.4 Observation location 

The principal location of interest is usually associated with the ultimate feature-of-interest. 

However, the location of the feature-of-interest may not be trivially available. For example: in remote sensing 
applications, a complex processing chain is required to geolocate the scene or swath; in feature-detection 
applications the initial observation may be made on a scene, but the entity to be detected, which is the 
ultimate feature-of-interest, occupies some location within it. The distinction between the proximate and 
ultimate feature-of-interest is a key consideration in these cases. 

Other locations appear in various scenarios. Sub-sampling at locations within the feature-of-interest may 
occur. The procedure may involve a sensor located remotely from the ultimate feature-of-interest (e.g. remote 
sensing; or where specimens are removed from their sampling location and observations made ex-situ). 
Furthermore, the location of the feature-of-interest may be time-dependent. 

The model is generic. The geospatial location of the feature-of-interest may be of little or no interest for some 
observations (e.g. live specimens, observations made on non-located things like chemical species). 

For these reasons, a generic Observation class does not have an inherent location property. Relevant location 
information should be provided by the feature-of-interest, or by the observation procedure, according to the 
specific scenario. 

NOTE In contrast to spatial properties, some temporal properties are associated directly with an observation (7.2.2.2; 
7.2.2.3). This is a consequence of the fact that an observation is a kind of ‘event’ so its temporal characteristics are 
fundamental, rather than incidental. 

7.1.5 Result types 

Observation results may have many datatypes, including primitive types like category or measure, but also 
more complex types such as time, location and geometry. Complex results are obtained when the observed 
property requires multiple components for its encoding. Furthermore, if the property varies on the feature-of-
interest, then the result is a coverage, whose domain extent is the extent of the feature. In a physical 
realization, the result will typically be sampled discretely on the domain, and may be represented as a discrete 
coverage. 

The result type may be used as a basis for defining specialized observation types. 

7.1.6 Measurements 

In conventional measurement theory (e.g. [1][5][10][11][19]) the term “measurement” is used. However, a distinction 
between measurement and category-observation has been adopted in more recent work [2][12][21] so the term 
“observation” is used here for the general concept. “Measurement” may be reserved for cases where the 
result is a numerical quantity. 

7.2 Observation schema 

7.2.1 Packaging 

The observation schema is organized in one package containing eleven leaf packages corresponding to the 
conformance classes defined in 2.2, with dependencies on several other packages from International 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  9 
 

Standards covering geographic information, on the General Feature Instance package (C.2) and the Temporal 
Coverage package (C.3). The inter-package dependencies are shown in Figure 1. The core observation 
package is documented in this subclause. The specialized observations are documented in Clause 8.

7.2.2 OM_Observation 

7.2.2.1 General 

The class OM_Observation (Figure 2) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109), which 
therefore represents a feature type. OM_Observation shall support five attributes and six associations, and 
shall be subject to four constraints.

Figure 2 — The basic Observation type 

7.2.2.2 phenomenonTime 

The attribute phenomenonTime:TM_Object shall describe the time that the result (7.2.2.9) applies to the 
property of the feature-of-interest (7.2.2.7). This is often the time of interaction by a sampling procedure 
(9.1.3) or observation procedure (7.2.2.10) with a real-world feature. 

NOTE The phenomenonTime is the temporal parameter normally used in geospatial analysis of the result. 

If the observedProperty of an observation is ‘occurrence time’ then the result should be the same as the 
phenomenonTime. 

7.2.2.3 resultTime 

The attribute resultTime:TM_Instant shall describe the time when the result became available, typically when 
the procedure (7.2.2.10) associated with the observation was completed. For some observations, this is 
identical to the phenomenonTime. However, there are important cases where they differ. 

EXAMPLE 1 Where a measurement is made on a specimen in a laboratory, the phenomenonTime is the time the 
specimen was retrieved from its host, while the resultTime is the time the laboratory procedure was applied. 

EXAMPLE 2 The resultTime also supports disambiguation of repeat measurements made of the same property of a 
feature using the same procedure. 

EXAMPLE 3 Where sensor observation results are post-processed, the resultTime is the post-processing time, while 
the phenomenonTime is the time of initial interaction with the world. 

EXAMPLE 4 Simulations can estimate the values for phenomena in the future or past. The phenomenonTime is the 
time that the result applies to, while the resultTime is the time that the simulation was executed.

7.2.2.4 validTime 

If present, the attribute validTime:TM_Period shall describe the time period during which the result is intended 
to be used. 

NOTE This attribute is commonly required in forecasting applications. 

7.2.2.5 parameter 

If present, the attributes parameter:NamedValue shall describe an arbitrary event-specific parameter. This 
might be an environmental parameter, an instrument setting or input, or an event-specific sampling parameter 
that is not tightly bound to either the feature-of-interest (7.2.2.7) or to the observation procedure (7.2.2.10). To 
avoid ambiguity, there shall be no more than one parameter with the same name. 

NOTE Parameters that are tightly bound to the procedure can be recorded as part of the procedure description. 

In some contexts, the Observation::procedure (7.2.2.10) is a generic or standard procedure, rather than an 
event-specific process. In this context, parameters bound to the observation act, such as instrument settings, 
calibrations or inputs, local position, detection limits, asset identifier, operator, may augment the description of 
a standard procedure. 

EXAMPLE A time sequence of observations of water quality in a well might be made at variable depths within the 
well. While these can be associated with specimens taken from the well at this depth as the features-of-interest, a more 
common approach is to identify the well itself as the feature-of-interest, and add a “samplingDepth” parameter to the 
observation (Figure 3). The sampling depth is of secondary interest compared to the temporal variation of water quality at 
the site. 

 

 

Figure 3 — (Example) Observation instances in the same well at different depths,  
described using the ‘parameter’ attribute 

7.2.2.6 resultQuality 

If present, the attributes resultQuality:DQ_Element shall describe the quality of the result (7.2.2.9). This 
instance-specific description complements the description of the observation procedure (7.2.2.10), which 
provides information concerning the quality of all observations using this procedure. The quality of a result 
may be assessed following the procedures in ISO 19157. Multiple measures may be provided. 

7.2.2.7 Domain 

The association Domain shall link the OM_Observation to the GFI_Feature (C.2.1) that is the subject of the 
observation and carries the observed property. This feature has the role featureOfInterest with respect to the 
observation. This feature is the real-world object whose properties are under observation, or is a feature 
intended to sample the real-world object, as described in Clause 9 of this International Standard. An 
observation instance serves as a propertyValueProvider for its feature-of-interest. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

12 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

7.2.2.8 Phenomenon 

The association Phenomenon shall link the OM_Observation to the GF_PropertyType for which the 
OM_Observation:result (7.2.2.9) provides an estimate of its value. The property type has the role 
observedProperty with respect to the observation. 

The observed property shall be a phenomenon associated with the feature-of-interest. 

An observed property may be, but need not be, modelled as a property (in the sense of the General Feature 
Model) in a formal application schema that defines the type of the feature-of-interest. 

An instance of GF_PropertyType shall describe a property that is either assignable or observable (7.1.2), such 
as "temperature", "height", "colour", "material". A property type may be an operation or function such as a 
spatiotemporal coverage. Property-type definitions may be organized into a hierarchy or ontology and 
managed in a register and catalogued to support discovery functions. The observed property supports 
semantic or thematic classification of observations, which is useful for discovery and data fusion. 

NOTE In general, the value of a specific observedProperty can be associated with different feature types in different 
observations, thus allowing the results of observations made in different projects or campaigns, and even from different 
disciplines, to be combined when required. A property-type register used in observations is most useful if each property 
type is not tied to a single feature type, or if equivalence relationships between similar property types from different feature 
types are provided. 

7.2.2.9 Range 

The association Range shall link the OM_Observation to the value generated by the procedure. The value has 
the role result with respect to the observation. The type of the result is shown as “Any”, since it may represent 
the value of any feature property. 

NOTE 1 OGC SWE Common [20] provides a model suitable for describing many kinds of observation results. 

The type of the observation result shall be consistent with the observed property, and the scale or scope for 
the value shall be consistent with the quantity or category type. If the observed property (7.2.2.8) is a spatial 
operation or function, the type of the result may be a coverage. 

NOTE 2 In some contexts, particularly in earth and environmental sciences, the term “observation” is used to refer to 
the result itself. 

7.2.2.10 ProcessUsed 

The association ProcessUsed shall link the OM_Observation to the OM_Process (7.2.3) used to generate the 
result. The process has the role procedure with respect to the observation. A process might be responsible for 
more than one generatedObservation. 

The OM_Process shall be suitable for the observed property. As a corollary, details of the observed property 
are constrained by the procedure used. 

EXAMPLE Observed radiance wavelength is determined by the response characteristics of the sensor. 

A description of the observation procedure provides or implies an indication of the reliability or quality of the 
observation result. 

7.2.2.11 Metadata 

If present, the association Metadata shall link the OM_Observation to descriptive metadata. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  13 
 

7.2.2.12 Constraints — Consistency with domain model 

The type of the feature-of-interest is defined in an application schema (ISO 19109). This may be part of a 
domain model, or may be from a cross-domain model, such as Sampling Features (Clause 9). The feature 
type defines its set of properties. For consistency, the feature-of-interest shall carry the observed property as 
part of the definition of its type (e.g. Figure 4). 

EXAMPLE A feature type “Pallet” might be defined as having the attribute “mass” of type “Measure”. An observation 
providing the value of this property shall have observedProperty=“mass”, the result shall be of the type “Measure” and the 
scale (unit of measure) shall be suitable for mass measurements. 

 

 

Figure 4 — (Example) An observation with consistent properties: the observed property (mass)  
is a phenomenon associated with the type of the feature-of-interest (Pallet) and the procedure 

and result type are also suitable 

In the case of a feature property with internal structure (e.g. feature associations), the observed property may 
be of one component, or of a subset of elements, of the complete feature property. Hence, the observed 
property might not appear directly as a first-order property in the type definition for the feature-of-interest, but 
shall appear within the structure of the feature type definition at some level (e.g. Figure 5). 

 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

14 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

 

Figure 5 — (Example) An observation where the observed property is not a direct member  
of the type of the feature-of-interest 

Other consistency constraints are that  

— the procedure shall be suitable for the observed property, and 

— the result type shall be consistent with the observed property (e.g. Figure 4). 

7.2.3 OM_Process 

The class OM_Process (Figure 2) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109), which 
therefore represents a feature type. OM_Process is abstract, and has no attributes, operations or associations. 
It serves as the base class for observation processes. The purpose of an observation process is to generate 
an observation result. An instance of OM_Process is often an instrument or sensor, but may be a human 
observer, a simulator, or a process or algorithm applied to more primitive results used as inputs. 

NOTE ISO 19115-2 provides MI_Instrument, LE_Processing and LE_Algorithm, which could all be modelled as 
specializations of OM_Process. OGC SensorML [16] provides a model which is suitable for many observation procedures. 

7.2.4 ObservationContext 

7.2.4.1 General 

Some observations depend on other observations to provide a context which is important, sometimes 
essential, in understanding the result. These dependencies are stronger than mere spatiotemporal 
coincidences, requiring explicit representation. If present, the association class ObservationContext (Figure 2) 
shall link an OM_Observation to another OM_Observation, with the role name relatedObservation for the 
target. It shall support one attribute. 

EXAMPLES Some examples include the conditions associated with experimental replicates (e.g. experimental plots 
and treatments used), biotic factors (e.g. ecological community), interactions among features (e.g. predator-prey), or other 
temporary relationships occurring at the time of observation that are not inherent to the observed features themselves (i.e. 
they change over time), or the related observation may provide input to a process that generates a new result. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  15 
 

This association complements the Intention association (9.2.2.1, 9.2.2.4) which describes relationships 
between a sampling feature and domain features. 

7.2.4.2 role 

The attribute role:GenericName shall describe the relationship of the target OM_Observation to the source 
OM_Observation. 

7.2.5 NamedValue 

7.2.5.1 General 

The class NamedValue provides for a generic soft-typed parameter value. NamedValue shall support two 
attributes. 

7.2.5.2 name 

The attribute name:GenericName shall indicate the meaning of the named value. Its value should be taken 
from a well-governed source if possible. 

EXAMPLE When used as the value of an Observation:;parameter, the name might take values like 
‘procedureOperator’, ‘detectionLimit’, ‘amplifierGain’, ‘samplingDepth’. 

7.2.5.3 value 

The attribute value:Any shall provide the value. The type “Any” should be substituted by a suitable concrete 
type, such as CI_ResponsibleParty or Measure. 

7.3 Use of the observation model 

The Observation model takes a data-user-centric viewpoint, emphasizing the semantics of the feature-of-
interest and its properties. This contrasts with Sensor-oriented models, which take a process- and thus 
provider-centric viewpoint. 

An observation is a property-value-provider for a feature-of-interest. Aside from the result, the details of the 
observation event are primarily of interest in applications where an evaluation of errors in the estimate of the 
value of a property is of concern. The Observation could be considered to carry “property-level” instance 
metadata, complementing the dataset-level and feature-level metadata that have been conventionally 
considered (e.g. ISO 19115). 

Additional discussion of the application of the observation and sampling models, and nuances within these, is 
provided in Annex D. 

8 Specialized observations 

8.1 Classification of observation by result type 

The observation result type shall be suitable for the observed property. The observation type may be 
classified by the type of the result. Two groups of specialized observations may be distinguished: 

a) Observations whose result is a constant or static value: observations for which the result of a single 
observation may be either single-valued or multi-valued, but, if there are multiple values, those values do 
not vary with either spatial position or time during the duration of the observation. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

16 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

b) Observations whose result varies within the scope of the feature-of-interest: observations for which the 
result of a single observation contains multiple values that vary with either spatial position, time, or both, 
during the duration of the observation. 

8.2 Observations whose result is constant 

8.2.1 General 

Where a property of the feature-of-interest is spatially and temporally invariant during the period of an 
observation, the corresponding observation result is a scalar (e.g. mass, length, temperature), or a record 
whose components correspond to a thematic decomposition of the observed property (e.g. bands of a 
spectrum, components of a wind-velocity vector, components of a stress tensor, elements of a geometry). 
Where a standard model for the observed property is available, this may be used for the result (e.g. 
observations of position, shape, or time should use GM_Object and TM_Object). 

8.2.2 Taxonomy of observation types whose result is constant 

Observation types with results that are internally invariant with respect to space or time are in the Specialized 
Observation package and are shown in Figure 6. 

 

 

Figure 6 — Specializations of observation by result type 

The classes Measure, ScopedName, Integer, Boolean, Record and RecordType are defined in ISO/TS 19103, 
TM_Object in ISO 19108 and GM_Object in ISO 19107. 

For each specialized observation class, the target of the association named ‘Range’ with the role-name ‘result’ 
shall be redefined as indicated in Figure 6 and Table 3. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  17 
 

Table 3 — Result types for specialized observations 

Specialized observation class Result type Example 

OM_Measurement Measure A measurement of "mass" (property type) of "the 
seventh banana" (feature-of-interest) using the "kitchen 
scales" (procedure) had the result "150 g". 

OM_CategoryObservation ScopedName A category observation of the "taxon" (property type) of 
"specimen 123" (feature-of-interest) by "Amy Bachrach" 
(procedure) had the result "Eucalyptus caesia" (from 
the Flora of Australia). 

OM_CountObservation Integer A count observation of "the number of votes cast" 
(property type) at "the municipal election" (feature-of-
interest) using the "electronic voting machine tally" 
(procedure) had the result "3542". 

OM_TruthObservation Boolean A truth observation of "presence" (property type) of 
"intruder" (feature-of-interest) using the "CCTV" 
(procedure) had the result "false". 

OM_TemporalObservation TM_Object A temporal observation of "duration" (property type) for 
"Usain Bolt 100m dash" (feature-of-interest) using the 
"stop watch" (procedure) had the result "9,6 s".a 

OM_GeometryObservation GM_Object A geometry observation of "perimeter" (property type) 
for "plot 987" (feature-of-interest) using the "field survey 
GHJ" (procedure) had the result "(… description of 
polygon …)". 

OM_ComplexObservation Record 
(ISO/TS 19103:2005) 

A complex observation of "major element composition" 
(property type) for "specimen h8j" (feature-of-interest) 
using the "ICPMS" (procedure) had the result "(… array 
of element proportions …)". 

a If the observedProperty of a temporal observation is ‘occurrence time’ then the value of the result will generally be the same as 
the value of the phenomenonTime. 

 
8.3 Observations whose result varies 

8.3.1 General 

Where the type of a feature allows for a property that is dependent on some parameter, then the value of the 
property is a function of this parameter. 

EXAMPLE 1 The length of a rail varies with temperature. 

If the variation is temporal or spatial, then the function is a coverage (CV_Coverage — ISO 19123:2005) 
whose domain extent is the spatiotemporal extent of the feature. The value of a corresponding observation 
result shall therefore be a function or coverage, respectively. In practice, the observation will sample the 
relevant axis of the target feature, so the observation result is usually represented as a discrete function or 
coverage (CV_DiscreteCoverage). 

The target feature may have many observations made on it using different sampling regimes, so the sampling 
regime is associated with the act of observation, rather than being inherent in the feature-of-interest. This may 
be accommodated by the decomposition of the domain geometry (i.e. the CV_DomainObject elements) in the 
observation result. The decomposition of the domain geometry in the result provides an intrinsic element of 
the overall observation protocol. 

NOTE The sampling regime may also be accommodated by multiple observations on a complex of sampling features 
(9.2.3). 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E)

EXAMPLE 2 The colour of a scene varies with position. The result of an observation of the property ”colour” of the 
scene is a coverage. Each domain element is a pixel whose index allows the spatial location within the scene to be 
obtained. 

EXAMPLE 3 Many properties of an observation well vary along its length, including rock type, orientation, permeability, 
etc. These are conventionally encoded as “logs”, with different sampling regimes. Each well-log is a coverage whose 
domain is the curve describing the shape of the well. The domain is sampled with elements whose location is described in 
terms of 1-D position measured along the well axis. 

A simple case concerns sampling a property at points on an extensive feature. The observation result is a set 
of point-value pairs (CV_PointValuePair — ISO 19123:2005). 

EXAMPLE 4 Temperature might be sampled using an array of weather stations. The temperature field of the region 
covered by the array can be represented as a discrete point coverage, whose domain-elements correspond to the station 
locations. 

An important case concerns monitoring a time-varying property of a persistent feature by sampling at discrete 
points in time. The observation result is a set of time-value pairs (either CV_PointValuePair, in which the point 
geometry uses a temporal reference system, or CVT_TimeInstantValuePair — C.3.2). 

EXAMPLE 5 An air- or water-quality monitoring station observes properties such as ozone, turbidity, etc. The 
instantaneous value is a scalar concentration or index value. However, the value is time-dependent. The value can be 
expressed as a coverage whose domain is the period of interest. This is usually described as a time series, which is a 
discrete time coverage. 

The feature-of-interest may be naturally structured into elements, such as a road network composed of road 
segments, or a state composed of administrative areas at a finer scale, or a farm composed of fields. 
Observation of a property of these features may capture its variation as a function of the sub-features. In 
these cases, the standard members of the target feature are responsible for decomposition of the domain 
geometry. 

8.3.2 Taxonomy of coverage observation types 

Observation types with variable results are shown in Figure 7. 

For each specialized observation class whose result varies, the target of the association named ‘Range’ with 
the role-name ‘result’ shall be redefined as indicated in Figure 7 and Table 4.

9 Fundamental characteristics of sampling features 

9.1 The context for sampling 

9.1.1 Proximate vs. ultimate feature-of-interest 

9.1.1.1 Introduction 

The observation model maps the result of the application of a procedure to a subject, which plays the role of 
feature-of-interest of the observation (Clause 7). However, the proximate feature-of-interest of an observation 
may not be the ultimate domain-specific feature whose properties are of interest in the investigation of which 
the observation is a part. There are two circumstances that can lead to this:  

a)  the observation does not obtain values for the whole of a domain feature;  

b) the observation procedure obtains values for properties that are not characteristic of the type of the 
ultimate feature.  

Furthermore, in some practical situations, both differences apply. 

9.1.1.2 Proximate feature-of-interest embodies a sample design 

For various reasons, the domain feature may not be fully accessible. In such circumstances, the procedure for 
estimating the value of a property of the domain feature involves sampling in representative locations. Then 
the procedure for transforming a property value observed on the sample to an estimate of the property on the 
ultimate feature-of-interest depends on the sample design. 

EXAMPLE 1 The chemistry of water in an underground aquifer is sampled at one or more positions in a well or bore. 

EXAMPLE 2 The magnetic field of the earth is sampled at positions along a flight-line. 

EXAMPLE 3 The structure of a rock mass is observed on a cross-section exposed in a river bank. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

20 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

9.1.1.3 Observed property is a proxy 

The procedure for obtaining values of the property of interest may be indirect, relying on direct observation of 
a more convenient parameter which is a proxy for the property of interest. Application of an algorithm or 
processing chain obtains an estimate of the ultimate property of interest. 

The observation model requires that the feature-of-interest of the initial observation be of a type that carries 
the observed property within its properties. Thus, if the proxy property is not a member of the ultimate feature-
of-interest, a proxy feature with a suitable model shall be involved. 

EXAMPLE A remote sensing observation might obtain the reflectance colour, when the investigation is actually 
interested in vegetation type and quality. The feature which contains reflectance colour is a scene or swath, while the 
feature carrying vegetation properties is a parcel or tract. 

9.1.1.4 Combination 

These variations may be combined if exhaustive observation of the domain feature is impractical, and direct 
measurement is of a proxy property. 

EXAMPLE For certain styles of mineralization, the gold concentration of rocks in a region might be estimated 
through measurement of a related element (e.g. copper), in a specimen of gravel collected from a stream that drains part 
of the region. The gravel samples the rocks in the catchment of the stream, i.e. in the stream bed and upslope. 

9.1.2 Role of sampling features 

Sampling features are artefacts of an observational strategy, and have no significant function outside of their 
role in the observation process. The physical characteristics of the features themselves are of little interest, 
except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign. 

EXAMPLE A “station” is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or procedure may be deployed 
and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the “world in the vicinity of the station”, so 
the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artefact such as a mooring, 
buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc. 

NOTE A transient sampling feature, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is 
unlikely to be revisited exactly. 

A sampling feature is intended to sample some feature-of-interest in an application domain. However, in some 
cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are 
made using the sampling features. 

9.1.3 Classification of sampling features 

A small number of sampling patterns are common across disciplines in observational science. These provide 
a basis for processing and portrayal tools which are similar across domains, and depend particularly on the 
geometry of the sample design. Common names for sampling features include specimen, station, profile, 
transect, path, swath and scene. Spatial sampling is classified primarily by the topological dimension. The 
generic characteristics of sampling features are defined in this clause; spatial samples of various dimensions 
are defined in Clause 10; and specimens in Clause 11. 

9.2 Sampling Schema 

9.2.1 Packaging 

The sampling schema is organized in one package containing seven leaf packages corresponding to the 
conformance classes defined in 2.2, with dependencies on the observation schema (Clause 7), the general 
feature instance package (C.2), and on several other packages from International Standards covering 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  21 
 

geographic information. The inter-package dependencies are shown in Figure 8. The core sampling feature 
package is documented in this clause. The spatial sampling feature packages are documented in Clause 10 
and the specimen package in Clause 11. 

 

 

Figure 8 — Package dependencies of the sampling feature schema 

9.2.2 SF_SamplingFeature 

9.2.2.1 General 

The abstract class SF_SamplingFeature (Figure 9) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType 
(ISO 19109), which therefore represents a feature type. SF_SamplingFeature shall support two attributes and 
three associations, and shall be subject to one constraint.

Figure 9 — Sampling feature core 

9.2.2.2 parameter 

If present, the attribute parameter:NamedValue shall describe an arbitrary parameter associated with the 
SF_SamplingFeature. This might be a parameter that qualifies the interaction with the sampled feature, or an 
environmental parameter associated with the sampling process. 

9.2.2.3 lineage 

If present, the attribute lineage:LI_Lineage shall describe the history and provenance of the 
SF_SamplingFeature. This might include information relating to the handling of the specimen, or details of the 
survey procedure of a spatial sampling feature. 

9.2.2.4 Intention 

A sampling feature is established in order to make observations concerning some domain feature. The 
association Intention shall link the SF_SamplingFeature to the feature which the sampling feature was 
designed to sample. The target of this association has the role sampledFeature with respect to the sampling 
feature, and shall not be a sampling feature or observation. It is usually a real-world feature from an 
application domain (Figures 5 and 10). 

EXAMPLE A profile typically samples a water- or atmospheric-column; a well samples the water in an aquifer; a 
tissue specimen samples a part of an organism.

Figure 10 — (Informative) Relationship between sampling and domain features  
(Each may appear as the feature-of-interest. If a sampling feature is involved, it samples a feature  

of a type defined in an application schema.) 

NOTE 1 The sampling feature, together with the observation procedure, describes the observation protocol. 

NOTE 2 GFI_DomainFeature is informative only. It stands for all feature types that are not observations or sampling 
features. 

9.2.2.5 Design 

Sampling features are distinctive compared with other features from application domains by having navigable 
associations to observations. If present, the association Design shall link the SF_SamplingFeature to an 
OM_Observation that was made utilizing the sampling feature, and the description of the sampling feature 
provides an intrinsic element of the observation protocol, along with the observation procedure (7.2.2) and the 
decomposition of the domain geometry in the case of a coverage-valued result (8.3). The OM_Observation 
has the role relatedObservation with respect to the sampling feature. Multiple observations may be made on a 
single sampling feature. 

9.2.2.6 Constraint 

A constraint on OM_Observation is that its observed property is a member property of the feature-of-interest 
either directly or transitively. Where the feature-of-interest of an observation is a sampling feature, the 
observed property shall be a member of the sampling feature or of the sampled feature. 

Where the identity or type of the sampled feature is not known prior to processing the observation result, the 
constraint cannot be enforced immediately. 

9.2.3 SamplingFeatureComplex 

9.2.3.1 General 

Sampling features are frequently related to each other, as parts of complexes, through sub-sampling, and in 
other ways. If present, the association class SamplingFeatureComplex (Figure 9) shall link an 
SF_SamplingFeature to another SF_SamplingFeature. It shall support one attribute. 

EXAMPLE Sampling points are often located along a sampling curve; specimens are usually obtained from a 
sampling point; pixels are part of a scene; stations are often part of an array.

This association complements the Intention association which describes relationships between a sampling 
feature and domain features. 

9.2.3.2 role 

The attribute role:GenericName shall describe the relationship of the target SF_SamplingFeature to the 
source SF_SamplingFeature. 

9.2.4 SF_SamplingFeatureCollection 

9.2.4.1 General 

The class SF_SamplingFeatureCollection (Figure 9) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType 
(ISO 19109), which therefore represents a feature type. SF_SamplingFeatureCollection shall support one 
association. 

9.2.4.2 Collection 

The association Collection shall link an SF_SamplingFeatureCollection to member SF_SamplingFeatures. 

10 Spatial sampling features 

10.1 The context for spatial sampling features 

When observations are made to estimate properties of a geospatial feature, in particular where the value of a 
property varies within the scope of the feature, a spatial sampling feature is used. Depending on accessibility 
and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or 
three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological 
dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features. 

This classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties 
observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to 
the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than 
the property value. 

10.2 Spatial sampling feature schema 

10.2.1 SF_SpatialSamplingFeature 

10.2.1.1 General 

The class SF_SpatialSamplingFeature (Figure 11) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType 
(ISO 19109), which therefore represents a feature type. SF_SpatialSamplingFeature shall support one 
attribute and two associations.

10.2.1.2 positionalAccuracy 

Positioning metadata is commonly associated with sampling features defined in the context of field surveys. If 
present, positionalAccuracy:DQ_PositionalAccuracy shall describe the accuracy of the positioning of the 
sampling feature. Up to two instances of the attribute support the independent description of horizontal and 
vertical accuracy. 

10.2.1.3 Geometry 

The association Geometry shall link an SF_SpatialSamplingFeature to a GM_Object that describes its shape. 

10.2.1.4 Platform 

A common role for a spatial sampling feature is to host instruments or procedures deployed repetitively or 
permanently. If present, the association Platform shall link the SF_SpatialSamplingFeature to an OM_Process 
deployed at it. The OM_Process has the role hostedProcedure with respect to the sampling feature. 

10.2.2 Taxonomy of spatial sampling features 

Concrete spatial sampling feature classes shall be distinguished on the basis of the type of the shape property, 
as shown in Figure 11 and Table 5.

The specialization of sampling features follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial 
dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does 
not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually 
less time-dependent than property value. 

10.3 Decomposition of extensive sampling features for observations 

The shape of a spatially extensive sampling feature (sampling-curve, -surface or -solid) defines a manifold 
within which a varying property may be characterized, and hence within which subsampling may be 
undertaken. The shape provides a complete sampling domain, but does not specify any particular 
decomposition. Sub-sampling may be described using related sampling features, or as domain elements 
(such as a segment in a 1-D curve; grid-cell, pixel or TIN triangle in 2-D; tetrahedron or block in 3-D) of a 
discrete coverage representation of the variation of a property within the sampling feature. The shape of the 
sampling feature is the context for domain decomposition. Where spatial sampling is involved, then both the 
sampling feature shape and its discretization as described in the domain of the coverage that comprises the 
observation result are required to describe the overall observation protocol. 

EXAMPLE 1 Logs of different properties along a well or borehole might use different intervals, and sub-samples might 
be either spatially instantaneous, or averaged in some way over an interval. The position of the samples can be 
conveniently described in terms of offsets in a linear coordinate reference system that is defined by the shape of the well 
axis. 

Time-dependent properties may be observed if a sampling feature is temporally persistent. 

EXAMPLE 2 The temperature of the atmosphere at a weather station varies as a function of time. 

Properties observed using a sampling feature may depend on non-spatiotemporal axes. 

EXAMPLE 3 The density of a specimen varies as a function of temperature. 

10.4 Common names for sampling features (informative) 

Some common names for sampling features used in various application domains include Borehole, Flightline, 
Interval, Lidar Cloud, Map Horizon, Microscope Slide, Mine Level, Mine, Observation Well, Profile, Pulp, 
Quadrat, Scene, Section, ShipsTrack, Spot, Station, Swath, Trajectory, Traverse, etc. These are mapped to 
the standard sampling feature classes in Figure 12. Note that these mappings are informative, and may not 
match some applications.

from its sampledFeature. 

11.2.1.6 currentLocation

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  29 
 

NOTE If a specimen no longer exists, for example, it was destroyed in connection with an observation act, then the

Mapping O&M terminology to common usage 

B.1 Introduction 

This International Standard defines terminology in support of a generic, cross-domain model for observations 
and measurements. Terms are taken from a variety of disciplines. The terms are used within the model in a 
consistent manner, but in order to achieve internal consistency, this varies from how the same terms are used 
in some application domains. In order to assist in the correct application of the model across domains, this 
annex provides a mapping from observations and measurements (O&M) terminology to some domain 
vocabularies.

Utility classes 

C.1 Introduction 

The Observations and Measurements schema has dependencies on classes and packages from a number of 
other International Standards covering geographic information, as indicated in Figures 1 and 8. A small 
number of classes are required which are not provided by existing external standards, but which are also not 
purely within the scope of this International Standard. This annex describes those classes. 

C.2 Extension to General Feature Model 

C.2.1 GFI_Feature 

The class GFI_Feature (Figure C.1) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109). It 
represents the set of all feature instances. 

NOTE GFI_Feature is implemented in GML (ISO 19136) by the element gml:AbstractFeature and type 
gml:AbstractFeatureType. 

 

 

Figure C.1 — Feature Instance model 

In an implementation, this abstract class shall be substituted by a concrete class representing a feature type 
from an application schema associated with a domain of discourse in accordance with ISO 19109:2005 and 
ISO 19101:2002. Sampling Features (Clause 9) are a class of feature types whose role is primarily associated 
with observations.

Annex D 
(informative) 

 
Best practices in use of the observation and sampling models 

D.1 Features, coverages and observations — Different views of information 

ISO 19109 describes the feature as a “fundamental unit of geographic information”. The “General Feature 
Model” (GFM) presented in ISO 19101 and ISO 19109 defines a feature type in terms of its characteristic set 
of properties, including attributes, association roles, and behaviours, as well as generalization and 
specialization relationships, and constraints. 

Typical concrete feature types have names like “road”, “watercourse”, “mine”, “atmosphere”, etc. For a road, 
the set of properties might include its name, its classification, the curve describing its centreline, the number of 
lanes, the surface material, etc. The complete description of a road instance, therefore, is the set of values for 
the set of properties that define a road type. This use of the feature model is object-centric, and supports a 
viewpoint of the world in terms of the set of discrete identifiable objects that occupy it. 

The principal alternative model for geographic information is the coverage, described in ISO 19123. This 
viewpoint focuses on the variation of a property within the (spatiotemporal) domain of interest. The domain 
might be a scene, a grid, a transportation network, a volume, a set of sampling stations, etc. The range of the 
coverage can be any property, such as reflectance, material type, concentration of some pollutant, number of 
lanes, etc. But the key to the coverage viewpoint is that it is property-centric, concerning the distribution of the 
values of a property within its domain space. 

These viewpoints are not exclusive, and both are used in analysis and modelling. For example, a feature 
might be detected from the analysis of variation of a property in a region of interest (e.g. an ore-body from a 
distribution of assay values). Also, for some feature types, the value of one or more properties might vary 
across the feature, in which case the shape of the feature provides the coverage domain (e.g. ore-grade 
within a mine). 

Observations focus on the data collection event. An act of Observation serves to assign a value to a property 
of a feature. If the property is non-constant, the value is a function or coverage. The results of a set of 
observations of different properties on the same feature-of-interest can provide a complete description of the 
feature instance. Alternatively, the results of a set of observations of the same property on a set of different 
features provide a discrete coverage of that property over a domain composed of the geometry of the feature 
set. The other properties of the Observation are metadata concerning the estimation of the value(s) of a 
property on a feature-of-interest. 

In particular, Observations concern properties (e.g. shape, colour) whose values are determined using an 
identifiable procedure, in which there is a finite uncertainty in the result. This can be contrasted with properties 
whose values are specified by assertion (e.g. name, owner) and are therefore exact. The observation instance 
provides “metadata” for the property value-estimation process. 

An observation event is clearly a “feature” in its own right, according to the GFM definition. An observation 
instance is a useful unit of information, therefore observation is a feature type. 

Transformation between viewpoints is frequently required. Some of the observation specializations provide an 
explicit demonstration of the transformation. 

This is illustrated in Figure D.1, which schematically shows a dataset comprising values of a set of properties 
at a set of locations. A row of the table provides the complete description of the properties at a single location. 
This is a representation of a potential feature description. A column of the table describes the variation of a 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E) 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium  41 
 

single property across the set of locations. This is a representation of a discrete coverage. A single cell in the 
table provides the value of a single property on a single feature. This might be the result of an observation. 

Observations, Coverage and Feature representations might be associated with different phases of the data-
processing cycle or value-chain: 

— The observation view is associated with data collection, when an observation event causes values for a 
property of a feature to be determined, and during data entry when the data-store is updated by inserting 
values into fields in the datastore. 

— A coverage view can be assembled from results of observations of a specific property, and represents 
data assembled for analysis, when the objective is to find signals in the variation of a property over a 
domain. 

— A discrete feature description is a “summary” viewpoint, assembled from results of observation on the 
same target, or an “inferred” viewpoint, by extraction of a signal from a coverage. 

 

 

Figure D.1 — Tabular representation of information associated with a set of locations 

D.2 Observation concerns 

D.2.1 Domain specialization 

Specialization of the observation model for an application domain is accomplished primarily using a domain 
application schema and its feature-type catalogue. For example, an instance of a feature type in the domain 
feature-type catalogue will provide the ultimate feature-of-interest for the investigation of which the 
observation is a part, and the characteristic properties of the feature type provide potential observed 
properties. A description of a sensor or process familiar within the application domain is the value of the 
observation procedure. 

The observation model encourages encapsulation of domain specialization in the associated classes, and the 
observation class itself rarely needs specialization. 

Nevertheless, other choices could be made in partitioning information between the classes in the model. For 
some applications, it might be convenient for information that is strictly associated with a second-layer object 
(procedure, feature-of-interest) to be associated with a specialized observation type.

For example, when measuring chemistry or contamination, the process often involves retrieving specimens 
from a sampling station, which are then sent to a laboratory for analysis. The specimen is a very tangible 
feature instance, with an identity. For some applications, it might be important to recognize the existence of 
the specimen, and retain a separate description of it. However, in other applications, particularly when the 
focus is on monitoring the change in a property at a sampling station, the existence of a series of distinct 
specimens is of minor or no interest. In this case, creating a series of objects and identifiers is superfluous to 
the user’s requirements. 

Nevertheless, some properties that might be strictly associated with such a specimen must still be recorded, 
such as “sampling elevation” in a water or atmospheric column. A number of choices can be made. For 
example, the elevation could be 

a) a property of each distinct specimen on which atomic observations are actually made, 

b) a property of the sampling station (which would require distinct stations for all elevations at which 
observations are made), 

c) a parameter of the observation procedure (which makes the procedure specific to this observation series 
only), or 

d) a parameter of the observation event, either using the soft-typed procedureParameter, or through 
specialization of the observation type. 

Any of these is a legitimate approach. The optimum one will be dependent on the application. 

All of the classes in the models presented here for observations and procedures can be further specialized for 
domain-specific purposes. Additional attributes and associations can be added as necessary. 

EXAMPLE “Assay” might be derived from Measurement, fixing the observedProperty to be “ChemicalConcentration” 
and adding an additional attribute “analyte”. 

D.2.2 Comparison with provider-oriented models 

The O&M model is intended to provide a basic output- or user-oriented information model for sensor web and 
related applications. The goal is to provide a common language for discourse regarding sensor and 
observation systems. 

In comparison, SensorML [16] has a process- or provider-oriented data model. These are usually used to 
describe data at an early stage in the data processing and value-adding chain. This might be prior to the 
details of the feature-of-interest and observed property being assembled and assigned to the result in a way 
that carries the key semantics to end-users of observation data. In particular, part of a SensorML datastream 
might include information that must be processed to determine the position of the target or feature-of-interest. 
At the early processing stage such positional and timing information might be embedded within the result. 

Nevertheless, even within these low-level models the O&M formalization can be applied. The proximate 
feature-of-interest is the vicinity of the sensor. The observed property is a composite type including 
components representing observation timing, and position and attitude of a sensor, etc. This must be 
processed to obtain the details of the ultimate feature-of-interest. The procedure is a sensor package including 
elements that capture all of the elements of the composite phenomenon or property type, etc. 

D.2.3 Observation discovery and use 

The Observation and Measurements model presented here offers a user-oriented viewpoint. The information 
object is characterized by a small set of properties, which are likely to be of interest to a user for discovery and 
request of observation data. The user will typically be interested primarily in a feature-of-interest, or the 
variation of a phenomenon. The model provides these items as first-order elements. An interface to 
observation information should expose these properties explicitly. 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E)

SOS [17] leverages the O&M model directly, with featureOfInterest and observedProperty being (1) explicit 
classifiers for an observationOffering in the capabilities description, used for discovery, and (2) explicit 
parameters in the GetObservation request. From a user point of view, the sensor or procedure description is 
primarily metadata, which is only of interest to specialists during discovery, and then to assist evaluation or 
processing of individual results. 

Each of these associated objects (sensor or procedure, target feature, phenomenon) might require a complex 
description. Hence they are modelled as distinct classes, which can be as simple or complex as necessary. In 
the XML serialized representation following the GML pattern, they might appear inline, perhaps described 
using one of the models presented here, or they can be indicated by reference using a URI [4]. The URI 
identifier might be a URL link or service call, which should resolve immediately to yield a complete resource. 
Or it might be a canonical identifier, such as a URN, which the user and provider are preconfigured to 
recognize and understand. 

On the other hand, SensorML takes a process- or provider-oriented viewpoint. Discovery and request is based 
primarily on the user having knowledge of specific sensor systems and their application. While this is a 
reasonable assumption within technical communities, specialist knowledge of sensor systems would not be 
routinely available within a broader set of potential users of sensor data, particularly as this is made widely 
available through interfaces like SOS. 

D.2.4 Observations vs. Interpretations 

Some conceptual frameworks make a fundamental distinction between observations and interpretations as 
the basis for their information modelling approach. This supports a pattern in which observations are given 
precedence and archived, while interpretations are more transient, being the result of applying the current 
algorithms and paradigms to the currently available observations. 

An alternative view is that the distinction is not absolute, but is one of degree. Even the most trivial 
"observations" are mediated by some theory or procedure. For example, the primary measurement when 
using a mercury-in-glass thermometer is the position of the meniscus relative to graduations. This allows the 
length of the column to be estimated. A theory of thermal expansion plus a calibration for the physical 
realization of the instrument allows conversion to an inferred temperature. Other observations and 
measurements all involve some kind of processing from the primary observable. For modern instruments, the 
primary observable is almost always voltage or resistance or frequency from some kind of sensing element, 
so the "procedure" typically involves calibrations, etc., built on a theory of operation for the sensor. However, 
the same high-level information model — that every "value" is an estimate of the value of a property, 
generated using a procedure and inputs — applies to both "observations" and "interpretations". It is just that 
the higher the semantic value of the estimate, the more theory and processing is involved. 

In some cases, it might be useful to explicitly describe the processing chain instance that has taken a more 
primitive observation (e.g. an image) and retrieved a higher level observation (e.g. the presence of a certain 
type of feature instance) through the application of one or more processing steps. 

D.3 Sampling concerns 

D.3.1 Sampling feature acts as observation-collector 

The sampling feature model satisfies the requirements described in 9.1. Sampling features provide 

a) an intermediate feature type that allows the assignment of primitive and intermediate properties within a 
processing chain, and 

b) a context for the description of sampling regimes. 

In addition, sampling features provide a feature type for observation collections, which have the homogeneity 
constraint that they share a common feature-of-interest. This provides an access route to observation

information that is convenient under some project scenarios, where the sampling strategy provides the logical 
organization of observations. 

EXAMPLE An observational mission or campaign might organize its data according to flightlines, ship's tracks, 
outcrops, sampling-stations, quadrats, etc., or an observation archive or museum might organize observations by 
specimen. 

D.3.2 Observation feature-of-interest 

Application of the Observations and Measurements model requires careful attention to identify the feature-of-
interest correctly. This can be straightforward if the observation is clearly concerned with an easily identified 
concrete feature type from a domain model. However, the ultimate feature-of-interest to the investigator might 
not be the proximate feature-of-interest for the observation. In some cases, a careful analysis reveals that the 
type of the feature-of-interest had not previously been identified in the application domain. 

The key is that the proximate feature-of-interest must be capable of carrying this result as the value or 
component of the value of a relevant property. So a useful approach in analysis is to consider what the result 
of the observation is, and then the feature-of-interest can be deduced since it must have a property with this 
result as its value. If an observation produces a result with several elements, or if there are a series of related 
observations with different results, then this might help further refine the understanding the type of the true 
feature-of-interest. 

EXAMPLE In monitoring situations, the feature-of-interest is often a typed event or “occurrence”. The observation 
procedure(s) provides an estimate of time, location, and type (e.g. species, identity) of the party involved. 

D.3.3 Processing chains and intermediate features-of-interest 

The Observation model implies a direct relationship between the observed property and the type of the 
feature-of-interest (e.g. a specimen type has a property ‘mass’ and observation observed property is ‘mass’). 
However, as discussed in 9.1.1.2 the relationship between the observed property and property(ies) of the 
ultimate feature-of-interest is often more complex. 

The Sampling Feature model is a mechanism for preserving the strict association, by providing a specific 
intermediate feature type whose observable properties are unspecified in advance, but supplied through an 
unlimited set of related observations. The path from a sensed property obtained through observations related 
to the sampling feature, to the interesting property on the ultimate feature-of-interest, is modelled as a 
processing chain. 

If intermediate values are explicit, then the processing chain can be modelled as a sequence of “observations”, 
with intermediate features of interest carrying intermediate property types. Each intermediate value must apply 
to a feature-of-interest that bears this property, or a sampling feature. Note that the types of these features 
might not be conventional or immediately recognisable, but the coherence of the Observations and 
Measurements model does imply their existence. Hence, if any intermediate result is made explicit, then a 
suitable intermediate feature must also be identified. 

D.3.4 Consistency constraints for sampling coverage observations 

An important class of observations are those made by sampling a property of a temporally persistent 
extensive feature, where the observation result is a discrete coverage over the sampling domain. Special 
cases include the OM_DiscreteCoverageObservation subclasses, but more generally the sampling geometry 
might be a compound structure in time and space. 

EXAMPLE 1 Physical oceanographers deploy expendable bathythermographs to measure seawater temperature as a 
discrete coverage along the sampling curve traced by the instrument’s descent (regarded as instantaneous with respect to 
ocean dynamics). 



OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E)

EXAMPLE 2 Meteorologists use radar wind profilers to measure wind speed and direction as time-series of discrete 
coverages at fixed heights on a sampling curve extending vertically from the Earth’s surface. 

EXAMPLE 3 Mobile sensors are used experimentally for monitoring urban air quality, by measuring concentration of 
ambient pollutants as a coverage over the sensor’s spatiotemporal trajectory along a sampling curve. 

In many of these applications, there are consistency constraints that relate to the observation, a sampling 
feature and a coverage result (Figure D.2), which could be expressed formally (at least in part) as OCL 
constraints [13] on a specialized Observation class called 'SamplingCoverageObservation': 

— the feature-of-interest of the sampling coverage observation is a sampling feature: 

 — self.oclIsKindOf(SamplingCoverageObservation) and 
featureOfInterest.oclIsKindOf(SF_SpatialSamplingFeature) 

— the observed property shall be consistent with the range type of the coverage result: 

 — observedProperty.memberName = result.rangeType.name 

— the shape of the sampling feature-of-interest shall contain the spatial elements of the domain of the 
coverage result: 

 — result.domainElement >forAll(d : CV_DomainObject | 
featureOfInterest.shape::contains(d.spatialElement)) 

— the phenomenon time of the observation shall correspond to the temporal extent of the domain of the 
coverage result: 

 — result.domainElement->forAll(d : CV_DomainObject | 
phenomenonTime::relativePosition(d.temporalElement) = TM_RelativePosition.Contains)
