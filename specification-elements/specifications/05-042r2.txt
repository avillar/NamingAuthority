i. Preface 

This document describes many aspects of the OGC web services architecture, which the 
OGC is currently developing. This architecture is a service-oriented architecture, with all 
components providing one or more services to other services or to clients. Since that 
architecture is being developed largely informally, broad descriptions of that architecture 
have not been previously written. Because that architecture is not yet completed, some 
aspects are not described here, and other aspects may change in the future. 

Suggested additions, changes, and comments on this draft report are welcome and 
encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by email message or by making 
suggested changes in an edited copy of this document.

OpenGIS® web services architecture description 

1 Scope 

This document summarizes the most significant aspects of the OGC (Open Geospatial 
Consortium) web services (OWS) architecture, which the OGC is currently developing. 
This architecture is a service-oriented architecture, with all components providing one or 
more services to other services or to clients. Because that architecture is not yet 
completed, some aspects are not described here, and other aspects may change in the 
future. 

NOTE  This document currently contains little information on access control and accounting, because 
those subjects are just beginning to be explored by the OGC. 

This document (currently) just describes this architecture. It does not attempt to provide 
all the guidance needed by an author or editor of an OGC Web Service specification.

4 OGC web services architecture overview 

This Service Oriented Architecture is based on the fundamental roles of service provider 
and service consumer within a distributed computing system. This pattern emphasizes 
that desired computing can be realized by combining multiple services, for each of which 
only the service types (e.g., interfaces and abilities) and server data holdings (e.g. 
content) need be known. It focuses component definition on providing and/or consuming 
a defined service. A Service Oriented Architecture also focuses on interactions between 
components implementing defined services, in the form of service requests, service 
responses, and service exceptions. 

The significant properties of the OGC web services (OWS) architecture, which the OGC 
is currently developing, include: 

a) Service components are organized into multiple tiers. 

1) All components provide services, to clients and/or other components, and each 
component is usually called a service (with multiple implementations) or a server 
(each implementation). 

2) Services (or components) are loosely arranged in four tiers, from Clients to 
Application Services to Processing Services to Information Management 
Services, but un-needed tiers can be bypassed. 

3) Services can use other services within the same tier, and this is common in the 
Processing Services tier. 

4) Each tier of services has a general purpose, which is independent of geographic 
data and services. 

5) Each tier of services includes multiple specific types of services, many of which 
are tailored to geographic data and services. 



OGC 05-042r2 

Copyright © 2005 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 5 
 

6) Servers can operate on (tightly bound) data stored in that server and/or on (loosely 
bound) data retrieved from another server. 

b) Services use is often chained. 

1) Services can be chained with other services and often are chained, either 
transparently (defined and controlled by the client), translucently (predefined but 
visible to the client), and opaquely (predefined and not visible to client), see 
Subclause 7.3.5 of [OGC 02-006 and ISO 19119] 

2) Services are defined to support defining and executing chains of services. 

3) Some service interfaces support server storage of operation results until requested 
by the next service in a chain. 

c) Service interfaces use open standards and are relatively simple. 

1) All services support open standard interfaces from their clients, often OGC-
specified service interfaces. 

2) OGC web service interfaces are coarse-grained, providing only a few static 
operations per service. 

3) Service operations are normally stateless, not requiring servers to retain interface 
state between operations. 

4) One server can implement multiple service interfaces whenever useful. 

5) Service interfaces share common parts whenever practical. 

6) Service interfaces can have multiple specified levels of functional compliance, 
and multiple specialized subset and/or superset profiles. 

7) Standard XML-based data encoding languages are specified for use in data 
transfers. 

8) Geographic data and service concepts are closely based on the ISO 191XX series 
of standards. 

9) Standard specifications are used for defining and referencing well-known 
coordinate reference systems (CRSs). 

d) Services communication uses open Internet standards. 

1) Communication between components uses standard World Wide Web (WWW) 
protocols, namely HTTP GET, HTTP POST, and SOAP. 

2) Specific server operations are addressed using Uniform Resource Locators 
(URLs). 

3) Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types are used to identify data 
transfer formats. 

4) Data transferred is often encoded using the Extensible Markup Language (XML), 
with the contents and format specified using XML Schemas. 



OGC 05-042r2 

6 Copyright © 2005 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

e) Server and client implementations are not constrained. 

1) Services are implemented by software executing on general purpose computers 
connected to the Internet. The architecture is hardware and software vendor 
neutral. 

2) The same and cooperating services can be implemented by servers that are owned 
and operated by independent organizations. 

3) Many services are implemented by standards-based Commercial Off The Shelf 
(COTS) software. 

4) All services are self-describing, supporting dynamic (just-in-time) connection 
binding of services supporting publish-find-bind. 

5 Service tiers 

5.1 Overview 

Except for clients, all OWS architecture components provide services, to clients and/or to 
other components. Each such component is usually called a service when multiple 
implementations are expected, and each implementation is called a server (or service 
instance). These components are thus usually called services or servers in this document. 

Clients are software packages that provide access to a human user, or operate as agents 
on behalf of other software. Software that provides access to a human user can be thin 
(e.g., a web browser), thick (a large application), or “chubby” (in between). 

All services (or components) are loosely organized in four tiers, as shown in Figure 1. 
This organization is loose in that clients and services can bypass un-needed tiers, as 
indicated by some arrows. Services can use other services within the same tier, and this is 
common especially in the Processing Services tier. Also, some services perform functions 
of more than one tier, when those functions are often used together and combined 
implementation is more efficient. Assignment of such combined services to tiers is 
somewhat arbitrary. 

NOTE  Complete separation of services into tiers is not required and is rare, especially when separation 
would be inefficient.

Figure 1 —Service tiers in OWS architecture 

This OWS architecture is designed for use where data is important and often voluminous. 
Servers can operate on (tightly bound) data stored in that server and/or on (loosely 
bound) data retrieved from another server. Most data is stored by the servers in the 
Information Management Services tier, but some data (can be and often) is stored in other 
services and servers. 

Each tier of services has a general purpose, as indicated by the names in Figure 1. That 
tier name is independent of geographic data and services, since some tier services are not 
specific to geographic data or services. Each tier of services includes multiple specific 
types of services, many of which are tailored to geographic data and services. Some of 
the services included in each tier are discussed in the following subclauses. 

5.2 Information Management Services tier 

The Information Management Services tier contains services designed to store and 
provide access to data, with each server normally handling multiple separate datasets. In 
addition, metadata describing multiple datasets can be stored and searched. Access is 
usually to retrieve a client-specified subset of a stored dataset, or to retrieve selected 
metadata for all datasets whose metadata meets client-specified query constraints. 

The services in the Information Management tier are used by clients and by services in 
the Application Services and Processing Services tiers. These services can use other 
services in the Information Management Services tier. The services included in this tier 
include (but are not limited to) the services listed in Table 1.

5.4 Application Services tier 

The Application Services tier contains services designed to support Clients, especially 
thin client software such as web browsers. That is, these Application Services are 
designed for use by clients instead of each client directly performing these often-needed 
support functions. The services in the Application Services tier are used by Clients, and 
can use other services in the Application Services, Processing Services, and Information 
Management Services tiers. The services included in this tier include (but are not limited 
to) the services listed in Table 4.

6 Services chaining 

In many cases, multiple services must be used together to perform a useful function. The 
OWS architecture thus supports “chaining” together of multiple servers, and such 
chaining is often used. This chaining is not limited to a linear chain; a network of services 
can also be “chained”. Within such a chain, most servers input the data that is output 
from the previous server in the chain. Services can be chained transparently (defined and 
controlled by the client), translucently (predefined but visible to the client), and opaquely 



OGC 05-042r2 

Copyright © 2005 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 13 
 

(predefined and not visible to client), see Subclause 7.3.5 of [OGC 02-006 and ISO 
19119]. 

To facilitate service chaining, some services are defined to support defining and 
executing chains of services. Also, some Processing Service interfaces are designed to 
support retrieving the data to be processed from another service, which can be an 
Information Management Service or another Processing Service. To allow more efficient 
execution of server chains, some service interfaces support server storage of operation 
results until requested by next service in a chain. 

7 Service interfaces 

The basic components of a service oriented architecture are services. There are many 
definitions of “service”, from the abstract to the concrete and practical. One definition is 
“useful/meaningful combination of operational interfaces and accessible content”. This 
definition adds “content” to the ISO/OGC definitions: 

a) Service: distinct part of the functionality that is provided by an entity through 
interfaces. 

b) Interface: named set of operations that characterize the behavior of an entity. 

c) Operation: specification of a transformation or query that an object may be called to 
execute. It has a name and lists of input and output parameters. 

OGC web service interfaces use open standards and are relatively simple. All services 
support open standard interfaces from their clients, often OGC-specified service 
interfaces. In addition to being well-specified and interoperable tested, the OGC-specified 
service interfaces are coarse-grained, providing only a few static operations per service. 
For many services, only three service operations are specified. 

NOTE 1 OGC web service interfaces are not fine-grained object-oriented, providing tens of operations 
per service to be implemented and exercised, with some interface objects being dynamically created and 
destroyed. 

In most cases, one service listed in Clause 5 includes just one interface. However, it is 
possible for one service to include more than one identified interface, normally limited to 
a few such interfaces. Also, one server can implement multiple interfaces whenever 
useful, without those interfaces being combined in a specified service. 

NOTE 2 One service interface is not required to support all the abilities of one server. For example, 
some WCS, WMS, and WFS data servers are expected to also implement CSW service interfaces 
cataloging the datasets available from that server. 

The OGC web service interfaces are usually stateless, so session information is not 
passed between a client and server. Clients (or Application Services) retain any needed 
interface state between operations. 

NOTE 3 Client-service sessions are not used, not requiring servers to retain interface state between 
operations. This also simplifies use in a dynamic network, where a server can stop operation or fail.

The OGC web service interfaces share common parts whenever practical, allowing those 
parts to be specified and implemented only once. For example, all OWSs have a 
mandatory GetCapabilities operation to retrieve server metadata. That server metadata 
includes four required sections, with the contents and format of three sections common to 
all services, and part of the fourth section common to most services. In addition, many 
service interfaces have multiple specified levels of functional compliance, or multiple 
specialized subset and/or superset profiles. 

NOTE 4 The interface parts are NOT separately and independently specified and developed. When more 
parts are common among interfaces, less work is needed to implement services and define new ones. In 
addition to the GetCapabilities operation, all OWSs have one mandatory operation to get a data subset, and 
most have one optional operation to get the description of a dataset or object. Interface compliance levels 
and profiles inherently share interface parts wherever practical. 

Standard XML-based data encoding formats and languages are used in many server-to-
client and client-to-server data transfers. The formats and languages specified include 
(but are not limited to) those listed in Table 5. In these formats and languages and 
elsewhere, the geographic data and service concepts are closely based on the ISO 191XX 
series of standards. 

NOTE 5 The ISO 191XX data and service concepts were developed by international groups of experts, 
so are carefully formulated and are being widely used. The concepts or semantics used by different services 
are not independently developed and specified.

8 Services communication 

8.1 Overview 

Communication between clients and services, and between services, uses only open non-
proprietary Internet standards. That is, the OWS architecture uses the Internet or 
equivalent as its distributed computing platform (DCP). More specifically, 
communication between components uses standard World Wide Web (WWW) protocols, 
namely HTTP GET, HTTP POST, and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Specific 
operations of specific servers are addressed using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). 
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types are used to identify data transfer 
formats. The data transferred is often encoded using the Extensible Markup Language 
(XML), with the contents and format carefully specified using XML Schemas. 

NOTE  Communication between components does not use CORBA, DCOM, .NET, or SQL. However, 
those protocols can be used within the implementation of a server. 

8.2 HTTP GET operation requests 

In many cases, a request to perform an operation by a service is transferred as a 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) GET message. That GET message is addressed to a 
HTTP Uniform Resource Locator (URL), where that URL locates a specific operation of 
a specific server. A URL for a HTTP GET request is in fact only a URL prefix, to which 
additional parameters are appended to construct a valid operation request. The prefix 
defines the network address to which operation request messages are sent, and may also 
identify a configuration of that server. 

A query is appended to the URL prefix to form a complete request message. Each OWS 
operation request has mandatory and usually optional request parameters. Each parameter 
has a defined name, and has multiple allowed values. To formulate the query part of the 
URL, the mandatory request parameters, and any desired optional parameters, are 
appended as name/value pairs in the form "name=value&" (parameter name, equals sign, 
parameter value, ampersand). In the OGC, this parameter encoding is often referred to as 
keyword value pair (KVP) encoding. 

8.3 HTTP POST operation requests 

Less frequently, a request to perform an operation by a service is transferred as a 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST message. That POST message is addressed to 
a (possibly different) HTTP Uniform Resource Locator (URL), where that URL locates a 
specific operation of a specific server. A URL for a HTTP POST request is a complete 
URL (not merely a prefix as in the HTTP GET case). 

Clients transmit request parameters to the URL in the body of the HTTP POST message. 
An OWS does not require additional parameters to be appended to the URL in order to 
construct a valid target for the operation request. When HTTP POST is used, the 
operation request message is normally encoded as an XML document, formatted as 
specified by one or more XML Schemas. The operation request message can alternately 
be KVP encoded, in the body of the HTTP POST message. 



OGC 05-042r2

8.4 HTTP operation responses 

After receiving an operation request, a server replies with a response message 
corresponding exactly to the request, or sends an exception report if unable to respond 
correctly. Responses to operation requests are the same whether the request is transferred 
by HTTP GET or POST. In most cases, the operation response is encoded in XML, using 
XML Schemas to specify the correct response contents and format. These statements 
apply to both normal and exception operation responses, which are separately specified 
for each OWS service. 

All XML Schemas used contain documentation of the meaning of each specified element, 
attribute, and type. All of these documentation elements are considered normative, unless 
labeled “informative”. Almost all of the concrete XML elements defined in these OWS 
Schemas can be used without separate XML Schemas, whenever no content extensions or 
restrictions are needed. An additional XML Schema is used whenever element contents 
extension is required, and should be used in some other cases to specify needed 
restrictions. 

NOTE  XML documents are not required to be validated against their respective schemas for normal 
service use. However, XML parsing and validation should follow normal XML syntax rules, for example 
regarding XML Namespaces. 

A server may send an HTTP Redirect message (using HTTP response codes as defined in 
[IETF RFC 2616]) to an absolute URL that is different from the valid request URL that 
was sent by the client. HTTP Redirect causes the client to issue a new HTTP request for 
the new URL. Several redirects could in theory occur. Practically speaking, the redirect 
sequence ends when the server responds with an operation response. The final response 
shall be an OWS operation response that corresponds exactly to the original operation 
request, or an exception report. 

8.5 MIME types use 

Response messages are accompanied by the appropriate Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions (MIME) type for that message. A list of MIME types in common use on the 
internet is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [IANA]. Servers can 
support parameterized MIME types, and this is common to more completely identify the 
specific format. In addition to parameterized MIME types, servers usually offer the basic 
un-parameterized version of the format, for clients that do no understand the 
parameterized MIME type. 

Response messages are accompanied by other HTTP entity headers as appropriate. In 
particular, the Expires and Last-Modified headers provide important information for data 
caching. Content-Length may be used by clients to know when data transmission is 
complete and to efficiently allocate space for results, and Content-Encoding or Content-
Transfer-Encoding may be necessary for proper interpretation of the results. When 
returning a large XML document, some form of data compression should be supported; 
since client-server communication transfer speeds will be considerably faster if the 
document is compressed.

8.6 SOAP operation requests and responses 

In some cases, a request to perform a specific operation by a specific server can be 
transferred in a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) operation request message. That 
SOAP request message is addressed to a HTTP Uniform Resource Locator (URL), where 
that URL locates a specific operation of a specific server (TBR). In this case, the 
operation request parameters are encoded in XML just like they can be for HTTP POST. 
When SOAP is used, the response from that operation is transferred in a SOAP operation 
reply message, and is XML encoded just like responses to HTTP POST requests. 

9 Server implementation 

Servers and client implementations are not constrained except for supporting the 
specified service interfaces. Each can be implemented by software executing on any 
general purpose computer connected to the Internet or equivalent. The architecture is 
hardware and software vendor neutral. The same and cooperating services can be 
implemented by servers that are owned and operated by independent organizations. 

 NOTE  Cooperating servers and clients need not be owned and operated by one organization or by 
formally cooperating organizations. 

All OWS services and clients are implemented by available standards-based Commercial 
Off The Shelf (COTS) software. This commercial software can sometimes be used 
without requiring major software development, or can be adapted to specific needs with 
limited software development. 

All services are self-describing, supporting dynamic (just-in-time) connection binding of 
services supporting publish-find-bind. That is, each server is able to “publish itself”, by 
providing a single authoritative source of its own server description upon request.

Annex A 
(informative) 

 
Service trading (publish – find –bind) 

Service trading supports the offering and discovery of interfaces which provide services 
of particular types. A trader implementation records service offers and matches requests 
for advertised services. Publishing a capability or offering a service is called “export”. 
Matching a service request against published offers or discovering services is called 
“import”. This can also be described in an equivalent manner as the “Publish – Find – 
Bind” (PFB) pattern of service interaction. The fundamental roles are: 

a) Trader (Registry) - registers service offers from exporter objects and returns service 
offers to importer objects upon request according to some criteria. 

b) Exporter (Service) - registers service offers with the trader object 

c) Importer (Client) - obtains service offers, satisfying some criteria, from the trader 
object. 

NOTE  In the OWS architecture, a Registry can be implemented using the Catalog Service for the 
WEB (CSW) service interface. 

The ODP Trading function is elaborated in document [ISO/IEC 13235-1] and refined 
somewhat in the OMG Trading specification [TBD], which is technically aligned with 
the computational view of the ODP trading function. Most importantly, a trader supports 
dynamic (i.e. run-time) binding between service providers and requesters, since sites and 
applications are frequently changing in large distributed systems. The fundamental roles 
and interactions are depicted in Figure 2.1 The equivalent PFB terminology is shown as 
well (blue italic text). A trader registers service offers from exporter objects and returns 
service offers upon request to importer objects according to some criteria. 

 

                                                   

1 Many readers will recognize Figure 2: many of the recent web services white papers include 
similar diagrams that map onto it directly. In many cases ‘find’, ‘bind’, and ‘publish’ substitute 
for ‘import’, ‘service interaction’, and ‘export’, respectively.

Figure 2 — Service trading objects 

A Trader plays the role of “matchmaker” in a service-based architecture. The interaction 
pattern is: 

a) To publish a service offer, an Exporter gives a Trader a description of a server, 
including a description of the interface at which that service instance is available. 

b) To find suitable server offers, an Importer asks a Trader for a server having certain 
characteristics. The trader checks the previously registered descriptions of servers and 
responds to the importer with the information required to bind with a service instance. 
Preferences may be applied to the set of offers matched according to service type, 
constraint expressions, and various policies. Use of the preferences can determine the 
order used to return matched offers to the importer. 

c) To bind a service, an Importer applies information received from the Trader to bind to 
a server. The Client then proceeds to use that server.

Annex B 
(informative) 

 
Architecture tiers relationship to ISO 19119 

The four tiers of the OWS architecture are loosely related to the geographic services 
categories specified in Subclause 8.3 of ISO 19119 Geographic information — Services 
(copied in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 12). This relationship is: 

a) The Application Services and the Clients together provide the “human interaction 
services” described in Subclause 8.3.2. 

b) The Processing Services provide the “processing services” described in Subclause 
8.3.5. It would be possible to divide these services into the “spatial”, “thematic”, 
“temporal” and “metadata” categories described in Subclause 8.3.5. 

c) The Information Management Services provide the “model/information management 
services” described in Subclause 8.3.3. 

In this description of the OWS architecture, the storage of datasets is not separated from 
catalogues or registries that store and search metadata, because they are not separated in 
ISO 19119. Also, these services are not separated because that distinction is frequently 
fuzzy. Furthermore, one server can implement a dataset storage and retrieval interface 
plus a catalogue interface for storing and searching the metadata for those datasets. 

Some services perform functions of more than one tier, when those functions are usually 
used together and combined implementation is more efficient. Assignment of such 
combined services to tiers is somewhat arbitrary. For example, all services in the 
Information Management Services tier can include some processing of the data retrieved. 
Specifically, WMS, WCS, and WFS can perform coordinate transformation and format 
conversion.

Annex C 
(informative) 

 
OWS architecture relationship to RM-ODP 

This architecture description is organized for ease-of-understanding, not according to the 
five viewpoints specified in the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-
ODP) [ISO 10746]. The concept of distributing computing functions across a network in 
a dynamic fashion has been addressed by this RM-ODP, which is a conceptual 
framework for such systems, and implementation patterns or rules. Five standard 
viewpoints are defined; these viewpoints address different aspects of the system and 
enable the ‘separation of concerns’: 

a) Enterprise viewpoint: articulates a “business model” that should be understandable by 
all stakeholders; focuses on purpose, operational objectives, policies, enterprise 
objects, etc. 

b) Information viewpoint: focuses on information content and system behavior (i.e. data 
models, semantics, schemas) 

c) Computational viewpoint: captures component and interface details without regard to 
distribution 

d) Engineering viewpoint: exposes the distributed nature of the system and provides 
standard definitions to describe engineering constraints 

e) Technology viewpoint: describes where to apply the technologies/products of choice 
and allows for conformance testing against the architectural specification 

This architecture description currently says little directly about the Enterprise and 
Information viewpoints. We think this OWS architecture is applicable to a broad range of 
purposes, using a broad range of information. However, Tables 1 and 2 suggest some of 
the types of information handled. 

Many aspects of the Computation viewpoint are discussed in Clauses 5-7 of this 
document. Clauses 8 and 9 discuss some aspects of the Technology and Engineering 
viewpoints.
