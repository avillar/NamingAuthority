5 Towards Secure Integration of OGC Web Services  

For the OGC OWS-7 initiative, the University of the Bundeswehr was tasked to perform 

a security evaluation for the integration of OGC Web Services with the FUSE ESB 

technology stack as selected by use in the System Wide Information Management 

(SWIM) System of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); further on referred to 

as “The System”. As OGC Web Service specifications are currently silent about security, 

this evaluation surfs the purpose to provide guidance and generate action items for the 

OGC standardization effort to properly enable security in the near future such that a 

seamless, interoperable but secure interconnection between The System and OGC Web 

Services can be achieved. This provides the benefit for the FAA to enable geospatial data 

exchange by securely using OGC Web Services to safely exchange geospatial 

information. And it provides the benefit to OGC standardization to gain a good 

understanding of security use cases, motivated by this security analysis.

5.1 Purpose and Scope 

It is the purpose of this Engineering Report to document the results of the security 

evaluation for the integration of OGC Web Services with The System undertaken during 

the OWS-7 initiative. The evaluation was undertaken upon information available in the 

Internet. These documents are listed in the sections “References” and “Bibliography”. 

It is the overall concern of security to prevent unauthorized access to protected resources. 

For distributed systems like The System and OGC Web Services, the prevention of 

unauthorized access applies to information in storage and in transit. Protecting 

information in storage from unauthorized access requires appropriate control about 

physical access to the system (safety) as well as secure user account and key 

management. An evaluation of these topics is out of scope to this document.  

In order to derive recommendations for the OGC standardization process regarding 

security, the main focus of this evaluation is to understand the architecture and the 

implementation of security requirements of interfaces that are relevant for The System to 

allow integration of external systems such as OGC Web Services.  

5.2 Security Requirements 

ISO 10181 (all parts) define a set of requirements in terms of a security framework for 

open systems. In order to protect the exchange of information between secured systems 

and the management of the stored data, the standard states that “… security services may 

apply to the communicating entities of systems as well as to data exchanged between 

systems, and to data managed by systems.”[4]. In subsequent parts of the standard, the 

requirements and the following security frameworks are defined: 

 Authentication Framework: ISO 10181-2 (see [5]) defines all basic concepts of 
authentication in Open Systems: It identifies different classes of authentication 

mechanisms, the services for their implementation and the requirements for 

supporting protocols. It further identifies requirements for the management of 

identity information. 

 Access Control Framework: ISO 10181-3 (see [6]) defines all basic concepts for 
access control in Open Systems and the relation to other frameworks such as the 

Authentication and Audit Frameworks. 

 Non-repudiation Framework: ISO 10181-4 (see [7]) refines and extends the 
concepts of non-repudiation, given in ISO 7598-2. It further defines general non-

repudiation services and the mechanisms to provide these services. 

 Confidentiality Framework: ISO 10181-5 (see [8]) defines the basic concepts of 
confidentiality, identifies classes of confidentiality mechanisms and their 

maintenance. It further addresses the interactions of the confidentiality 

mechanisms with other services. 



OGC 10-155 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  5 
 

 Integrity Framework: ISO 10181-6 (see [9]) defines the basic concepts of 
integrity, identical to the Confidentiality Framework. 

 Security Audits and Alarms Framework: ISO 10181-7 (see [10]) defines the 
basic concepts for security audit and alarms and the relationship to other security 

services. 

 Availability: This is a requirement that is in particular important in a Service 
Oriented Architecture. It is defined in ISO 7498-2 (see [11]) as „The property of 

being accessible and useable upon demand by an authorized entity. “ Adapting 

that to a Service means that the service shall be executable whenever there is a 

need. 

5.3 Summary of The System’s Architecture 

Note: The following architecture summary is based on [1]. 

The core of The System shall be implemented as an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), 

routing messages between network endpoints, hence a destination. A destination is 

considered a logical combination of a message queue and a topic. The message format is 

XML (SOAP) and the protocol is HTTP or JMS. Three different kinds of message 

routing for the Core are supported: 

 With Content-Based Routing, the destination of the message is determined from 
the content of the message. 

 With Context-Based Routing, environment information determines the 
destination of the message. 

 With Itinerary-Based Routing, the destination of the message is determined 
from metadata that is provided for the message itself. 

The described architecture does naturally support communication between network 

endpoints which provides the capability to push relevant information from one source to 

many receivers based on the notification pattern. In order to achieve other types of 

communication such as communication with services based on the request/response 

pattern, message mediation services must be deployed. Other message mediation services 

shall perform transformation of other message formats to The System’s Core message 

format and vice versa. Network mediation services shall be used to support message 

traffic on different network protocols other than the core protocol. 

The architecture further comprises of security services that are relevant for this 

evaluation: 

 Boundary Protection shall control and protect communication to and from 
external National Airspace Systems (NAS). 



OGC 10-155

 Information System Security Support Infrastructure services shall provide 
functions for key management. 

 Service Policy Enforcement and Access Management services shall control 
access to services and resources based on NAS policies. Rights in the policy are 

linked which the requesting entity’s identity, it’s role or any other attributes. 

 Security Monitoring services shall log the activities of NAS services and the 
activities of subjects on resources to detect a security breach or unauthorized 

access. The logged information shall be forwarded to a trust center for further 

analysis. 

5.4 Implementation of security requirements in The System 

In [1], section 5.1.3.2.4 “Security”, states “Authentication, authorization, and messaging 

security can be supported by a variety of mechanisms, including Java security APIs, 

username/password combination, or digital certificates (see Section 5.1.3.9).”. Section 

5.1.3.9 “Enterprise Messaging Security” is concerned with “Messaging security as it 

applies to Message Brokers and Web Services (implemented in WSFs, ESBs, and Web 

based components) …”. 

In a nutshell, The System’s security architecture describes the implementation of 

requirements in a network agnostic fashion. It is the assumption that SOAP messages are 

protected towards integrity and confidentiality by applying WS-Security (see [14]). It is 

further recommended that the guarantee of delivery and the elimination of duplicate 

messages and correction of message order (as it potentially could occur in the defined 

Core) is implemented via WS-Reliable Messaging (see [13]). Access Control is twofold: 

It shall be implemented to control the flow of information from one destination to another 

destination and it shall be implemented as part of the boundary protection to prevent 

unauthorized access to The System’s Core by external systems/services. The Core shall 

apply username/password or X.509 certificate based identification for direct and WS-

Trust (see [15]) based identification for brokered authentication. The concept of a 

Security Token Service (STS) shall be used for establishing trust between communication 

/ transaction parties. 

Of particular concern to this evaluation is how The System is protected to external, non 

NAS systems, e.g. OGC Web Services. In [1], section 5.6.3.2 ff. “Boundary Protection 

ISS Capabilities”, the general approach of boundary protection is introduced and in sub-

sections, specific types of boundary protection mechanisms are described for the 

following interaction pattern: 

 Boundary Protection for General Public Interaction Services 

 Boundary Protection for Support Services  

Figure 1 – NAS external boundary protection concepts ([1], p.5-51) illustrates the general 

boundary protection (see [1], p. 5-51). 



OGC 10-155 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  7 
 

 

Figure 1 – NAS external boundary protection concepts ([1], p.5-51) 

An external system is connected to  The System’s Core via a Perimeter network hosting 

the Exterior Boundary Protection System, which provides two firewalls; one firewall to 

the external system and one firewall to the internal system and application gateways 

hosting the NAS Security Gateway services. These services provide the protection to 

prevent unauthorized messages to be forwarded to the Core by intercepting and 

inspecting incoming messages. Based on the content of the message, decisions are made 

whether or not the intercepted message shall be forwarded to the Core. Administrators of 

the boundary protection system define the overall control criteria for the decision making. 

As this decision making takes place on information concerning the application level, 

domain specific knowledge is required to maintain those rules and/or implement the 

decision making process. 

General Public Interaction Services are to be used by human users and shall be made 

available to the general public in an anonymous fashion and to aviation partners where 

authorization depends on the requestors identity, approved through authentication. In 

general, the Interaction Services can be consumed via HTML pages or as RSS based 

feeds. As illustrated in Figure 2 – Boundary protection for General Public Interaction 

Services ([1], p.5-52), a Reverse Proxy shall control the incoming HTTP(S) requests to 

the Interaction Services, performing intrusion detection but also monitoring. It shall also 

undertake authentication and access control for ensuring aviation partners have legitimate 

access. OSAIS its Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) (see [19]) and the 

eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) (see [21]) are named standards 



OGC 10-155

to implement distributed authentication with the aviation partner(s) and to perform access 

control.  

 

Figure 2 – Boundary protection for General Public Interaction Services ([1], p.5-52) 

Support Services shall be used by other services where no human user is present. 

Support Services shall be made available to aviation partners that want to further process 

FAA status information to be incorporated into planning and automation services. This 

communication shall be based on SOAP (see [16]) with optional WS-Security (see [14]) 

to ensure message integrity and confidentiality. As illustrated in Figure 3 – Boundary 

protection for Support Services ([1], p.5-56), for Support Services, the Reverse Proxy is 

replaced by a XML Gateway that shall inspect the incoming SOAP messages by 

verifying the integrity and the validity of the XML message.  



OGC 10-155 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  9 
 

 

Figure 3 – Boundary protection for Support Services ([1], p.5-56) 

Requirements for the XML Gateway are defined in [3]. The communication shall be 

based on SOAP and the implementation of the following security requirements depend on 

the interaction scenario: Point-to-Point or Trusted Subsystem, Portal-to-Service, and 

Chained Service or Cross-Security Domain: 

 Authentication 

 Authorization 

 Integrity 

 Confidentiality 

 Non-Repudiation 

For the Point-to-Point  interaction scenario, three different constellations occur:  

(i) Client communicates with Service over HTTPS with mutual authentication based 
on X.509 certificates;  

(ii) Client communicates with Service and WS-Security Username Token is used for 
authentication;  



OGC 10-155 

10 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  
 

(iii) Client communicates with Service based on Security Token obtained from a STS 
to establish brokered trust. When a SAML Assertion based Token is used, it 

shall be possible to validate the chain of trust to the original assertion party.  

For the Portal-to-Service interaction scenario, the client is a Web Browser and must 

establish a TLS based HTTPS communication based on mutual authentication. 

Optionally, the portal relays the request to the target service by attaching a SAML Token 

to the received request and adding its own credential to establish the “on behalf” aspect 

based on WS-Trust. 

For the Chained interaction scenario, the Client interacts with the ESB instead of the 

Portal and the client is not a Web Browser. In order to fulfill a “on behalf” request, an 

optional STS shall be available that allows the client and the ESB to request and validate 

tokens. 

For the Cross-Domain interaction scenario, the communication between the client and 

the service is mediated by two ESBs; one ESB in the domain of the client and one in the 

domain of the service. Both ESBs shall obtain security tokens from a trusted STS that 

resides in the service domain. The client domain is considered the Perimeter (DMZ) 

Network and the service domain is the NAS Network. 

The System’s security outlined in [2] is concerned with Web Services security. It is 

concerned how to establish trust between Web Services based on the OASIS WS-Trust 

(see [15]) specification. As WS-Trust is based on SOAP and other security standards 

concerning message level based security, it can be used to overcome various Web Service 

/ Client integration scenarios. In that sense, [2] illustrates in detail how to apply WS-Trust 

(and related standards) to achieve authentication, authorization, integrity by applying 

applicable processing to the messages. It also covers the delegation aspect by introducing 

a solution by verifying the chain of trust, based on SAML 2 (see [20]) assertions. In 

particular, [2] introduces security architectures and patterns to secure the following 

interactions: 

 Portal-to-Service Interaction 

 Chained Interaction 

 Cross-domain Interaction 

In order to implement these interaction scenarios, the document introduces three kinds of 

security profiles: 

 SAML 1.1 Token Profile 

 SAML 2 Token Profile 

 WS-Security BinarySecurityToken Profile 

 WS-Security UsernameToken Profile

5.5 Evaluation of Security for the Boundary Protection 

This section describes the general security of the Boundary Protection in general and the 

security for Interaction and Support Services in particular. This, because we understand 

OGC Web Services as these types of services. 

5.5.1 Boundary Protection for NAS End System  

It is our understanding that communication between SIPs that do not belong to the same 

enclave cannot communicate to each other directly. The communication is routed via The 

System’s Core as illustrated in Figure 4 – Communication of external sub-systems ([1], 

p.5-9). The Core supports three different kinds of routing: (i) Content based, (ii) Context 

based and (iii) Itinerary based routing. As the implementation of integrity and 

confidentiality is based on WS-Security, each SOAP message must be digitally signed to 

guarantee integrity and can optionally be encrypted to ensure confidentiality. For XML – 

hence SOAP messages – XML Encryption (see [18]) supports the following options of 

encryption: (i) encrypt a complete XML document, (ii) encrypt an element in an XML 

document, (iii) encrypt an element's content in an XML document. 

As the encryption of (XML) messages is effective end-to-end (sender to the ultimate 

receiver), we see the following combinations for encryption option and routing to be 

possible: 

 Content based 

routing 

Context based 

routing 

Itinerary based 

routing 

XML document 

encryption 
NO MAY YES 

XML element 

encryption 
NO YES YES 

XML element 

value encryption 
NO YES YES 

Table 1 –Core routing and encryption options 

 

It is not possible to use content based routing for received external messages that are 

protected towards confidentiality, because they are encrypted. It is possible to do Context 

(environment information) based routing of encrypted external messages regardless of 

encryption option. But this is bearing a risk as the encrypted messages cannot properly be 

inspected by the boundary inspection, depending on the encryption option.  

 For document based encryption, it is not possible to verify the document structure 
and the origin of the message, as the related elements are encrypted.  



OGC 10-155 

12 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  
 

 For element based encryption, it is not possible to verify the structure of the 
message content but it is possible to verify the origin of the message.  

 For element value encryption, it is possible to verify the structure of the message 
content and the origin of the message. It is therefore possible to derive a solid 

decision if the message can be accepted or is to be rejected.  

 Itinerary based routing relies on meta information available with the SOAP 
message that is typically available from the SOAP header that binds to 

information in the SOAP body of the same message. Assuming that the meta 

information conveyed in the SOAP header is ultimately attached to information in 

the SOAP body and that the metadata itself is protected by a digital signature, 

Itinerary based routing is acceptable for any encryption option. However, it is 

recommended for implementations of the boundary protection to follow the 

recommendations given by the W3C in [19]. 

 

Figure 4 – Communication of external sub-systems ([1], p.5-9) 

5.5.2 Boundary Protection for General Public Interaction Services  Evaluation 

NAS Interaction Services are made available to non-NAS entities that reside outside the 

NAS (The System) and consume the information with a web browser via HTTPS. 

Protection for The System is anticipated through External Boundary Protection where the 



OGC 10-155 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  13 
 

perimeter network is separated with two independent firewalls from the external and 

internal network. The general architecture is illustrated in the figure below. 

 

Figure 5 – Communication of external entities with Interaction Services ([1], p.5-52) 

The most important functionality in the boundary protection is that – beside the firewalls 

– the communication from the external user clients to the NAS Interaction Services is 

routed via a Reverse Proxy and a Web Server functions as a mediator. This ensures that 

no direct communication can be established from the external client to the internal 

Interaction Services.  

Towards Authentication, two different user methods to establish a secure communication 

via HTTPS including mutual authentication shall be supported: Username / Password and 

X.509 certificates and  maintain revocation lists. This requires that a X.509 certificate 

management is in place to release and revoke user certificates. SAML is mentioned as an 

additional mechanism to establish brokered authentication in a distributed environment. 

This becomes necessary if the user accounts are not stored inside the external boundary 

protection (e.g. at the Reverse Proxy). 

Access Control can be established either in the Reverse Proxy based on configuration and 

environment information. [1] elaborates on p. 5-53 where enforcement of access 

restrictions shall be based on XACML policies following the proposed logical separation 

of enforcement and decision making as outlined in the XACML specification. The 

document foresees a Policy Enforcement and Policy Decision Point as part of the Access

Control Systems illustrated in the architecture (see Figure 5 – Communication of external 

entities with Interaction Services ([1], p.5-52)).  

External entities that wish to interact with the NAS Interaction Services in a confidential 

or integrity protected communication, a secure network connection can be established 

with the Reverse Proxy using HTTPS.  

Towards security audit and alarms, it is anticipated that the Reverse Proxy and the 

Mediation Service, as part of the Boundary Protection, provide the functionality to 

monitor the communication between the external user clients and the NAS Interaction 

Services. And because the communication confidentiality and integrity ends with the 

Reverse Proxy, the monitoring – as the prerequisite for audits and alarms – can be 

established.  

5.5.3 Boundary Protection for Support Services Evaluation 

NAS Support Services are made available to other services of non-NAS entities using 

SOAP over HTTPS. Similar to the protection of Interaction Services, the protection of 

Support Services is ensured by External Boundary Protection, where the external and the 

internal network are separated by two independent firewalls. This prevents direct 

communication from the external services to the NAS Support Services and enforces a 

routed and mediated communication. The incoming communication is handled by the 

XML Gateway which then – after inspection – forwards the requests to The System’s 

Core Messaging Platform that is deployed in the perimeter network; hence inside the 

security domain of the External Boundary Protection. The architecture is illustrated in the 

figure below. 

 



OGC 10-155

Figure 6 – Communication of external entities with Support Services ([1], p.5-56) 

In this setup, the entire intrusion detection, establishment of secure communication 

(protected towards confidentiality and integrity) as well as access control and 

authentication is all handled by the XML Gateway. This component therefore is mission 

critical and must be implemented with care based on solid requirements.  

Note: For the evaluation of the XML Gateway, we have used [3] as a supplement. 

According to [1], authentication can be performed by either mutual HTTPS 

communication or by leveraging WS-Security with SOAP messages. As HTTPS provides 

a secure communication channel between systems, it should be the intension to use 

mutual authentication based on X.509 certificates representing the digital identities of the 

peer systems only, to establish a secure communication channel. As the communication 

from the external systems with the Support Services is based on SOAP, it is good practice 

to use WS-Security (and WS-Trust) – as described in the document - to enable 

application-to-service (end-to-end) authentication. 

According to [1], confidentiality can be established on either connection level (HTTPS) 

or message level (XML encryption and WS-Security). We like to point out that there are 

fundamental differences between confidentiality established by HTTPS and XML 

Encryption on a SOAP message, causing side effects to overcome additional security 

requirements.  

With HTTPS communications, the confidentiality of the information ends at the receiving 

entity which is not necessarily the same entity consuming the information. This raises the 

concern that the communication with the consuming entity must also be secured. Even 

when there is another secure communication with the consuming entity, the information 

is available in the clear at the receiving entity.  

With confidentiality at the message level (encrypted SOAP body), the information is only 

available to the ultimate consumer and any other intermediary cannot read the 

information. This strength has a drawback on routing the incoming message, received by 

the XML Gateway to the appropriate consumer. Also, the encrypted message cannot be 

inspected at the XML Gateway so the ultimate consumer will process the message 

despite correct or malicious content. 

According to [1], integrity can be established on either connection level (HTTPS) or 

message level (XML digital signatures and WS-Security). We like to point out that there 

are fundamental differences between integrity established by HTTPS and XML Digital 

Signature on a SOAP message. When applying HTTPS, it is possible for the XML 

Gateway to inspect the incoming message and create additional (meta) information to the 

inspected message before forwarding to the ultimate consuming entity, because the 

message itself is not protected. When applying integrity to the SOAP message, it is still 

possible for the XML gateway to inspect the incoming message but depending how the 

digital signature was applied to the message, it is or it is not possible to extend the 

message with the own (meta) information.

5.6 Recommendations Towards Secure Interconnection with OGC Web Service 

We understand that OGC Web Services can be integrated to The System as service of 

trusted partners. As such, the connection of the OGC Web Services could technically be 

achieved by leveraging The System’s Boundary Protection. The Boundary Protection 

basically allows to securely connect two different types of services: Interaction Services 

and Support Services. The former is technically connected through HTTP (e.g. RFC 

1616) and secure extensions of HTTP such as HTTP+TLS/SSL, (e.g. RFC 2818). In 

order to analyses the ways OGC Web Services can be integrated, it is important to 

categorize existing OGC Web Service specifications and match them to be a support or 

interaction type service. The next step is to verify the existing interface to determine if 

the required binding and encoding is provided; hence HTTP and SOAP. 

5.6.1  OGC Web Services classification (interaction and support services) 

Categorization of OGC Web Services towards interaction and support services is 

potentially not a straight forward approach. Therefore, we introduce a table with three 

columns: 

 √ at column #1 means that we put the OGC Service functionality to match the 
description of an interaction service 

 √ at column #2 means that we put the OGC Service functionality to match the 
description of a support service 

 √ at column #1 and #2 means that OGC Service is potentially both; an interaction 
and a support service

5.6.2 OGC Web Services to be used as Interaction Services  

The secure integration of Interaction Services according to the use case foresees a 

communication via HTTPS and a user is consuming the service with a web browser or 

web browser based client. According to the OGC Abstract Topic 12, this is considered 

Transparent Service Chaining. In order to achieve this, it is sufficient for the service to 

provide a simple interface binding supporting RFC 2616 and RFC 2818. 

All OGC Web Service provide an interface binding that enables the service to be 

integrated with The System via a Boundary Protection System for Interaction Services 

using a Reverse Proxy. Because the support for HTTPS (HTTP+TLS or HTTP+SSL) is a 

feature of the deployment and not of the actual implementation of the service, no 

implications for OGC standardization exist. 

5.6.3 OGC Web Services to be used as Support Services  

The secure integration of Support Services according to the use case foresees a 

communication via HTTP or HTTPS and SOAP, where potentially the implementation of 

communication security (e.g. integrity and confidentiality) is ensured by securing SOAP 

messages according to WS-Security, and the service is “consumed” by another service 

and not used with a client operated by a human. Therefore, the OGC Web Service must 

provide a SOAP binding in order to be used as a Support Service. Also, the 

implementation of the service must support WS-Security and potentially WSDL+WS-

Policy or WS-SecurePolicy to enable the service to advertize its security restrictions in 

such a way that it can automatically be consumed by the service, functioning as an 

automated client with no human interaction. 

Not all OGC Web Services at the moment provide SOAP interfaces. The following table 

gives an overview which current versions provide SOAP interfaces.

5.6.4 Recommendations to OGC Standardization towards security 

For an operational use of OGC Web Services as outlined in this document, it is important 

that all relevant security requirements are implemented. Also, we recommend that OGC 

Web Services define fail state behavior that can be instantiated in case an error occurred 

from an attack. This is important to prevent harm to the asset. 

In addition to this document, we like to point out that a detailed security assessment 

report for OGC Sensor Web Services can be found in the OWS-6 Secure Sensor Web 

Engineering Report (see [32]).  

The following recommendation must be seen in the context of the question how to 

integrate OGC Web Services with The System in a securely manner to ensure the safe 

exchange of geospatial information. As outlined in previous sections, different security 

requirements must be implemented in order achieve this effort. As The System provides 

different integration strategies for Interaction and Support Services, we like to separate 

the recommendation accordingly. 

5.6.4.1 Towards secure integration of OGC Services as Interaction Services 

 Authentication  

For Interaction Services, it is essential to know the identity of the user. Various 

technologies of the underlying network protocol, such as HTTP, exist that can be 

used without affecting the OGC standardization, as the services interfaces do not 

need to change. 

However, making a service require authentication implies that certain failure 

semantics are defined. As this is not done sufficiently in most OGC Service 

specifications, we recommend to address this issue for the next revision. 

 Access Control 



OGC 10-155 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  19 
 

Denying or allowing access to an OGC Service requires that the service 

specifications defines corresponding error codes. For interaction services with the 

purpose to instruct the user of what to do next. 

We recommend that OGC Service specification revisions address this issue. 

Another facet of access control is filtering the result according to the interaction 

of the protected resources that the user requests and the resources the user has 

rights for. To our understanding, current OGC specifications do not allow the 

silent modification of a service request or response. We think it is therefore 

relevant to discuss ways forward how filtering becomes possible. 

 Non-repudiation 

The implementation of non-repudiation is out of scope for OGC Web Service 

specifications as it is a property of the deployment. 

 Confidentiality 

The implementation of confidentiality for OGC Services providing a “pure” 

HTTP binding is limited to communication channel security. However, for this 

type of interface binding, we do not see any recommendations that effect OGC 

standardization. 

 Integrity 

Same as confidentiality. 

 Security Audits and Alarms 

We understand the implementation of security audit as a deployment and use case 

specific issue which is independent from OGC Web Service specifications.  

Alarming as a trigger for audit is application – hence OGC Web Service – 

specific. In order to enable a common set of alarms, we recommend to define a 

standard set of rules for the different operations and OGC Web Service types.  

 Availability 

One aspect of ensuring availability for OGC Web Services requires the 

appropriate inspection of service requests. We think it would be helpful to define 

a common set of rules - perhaps as a best practices approach - that allows a 

standard way of request inspection. 

5.6.4.2 Towards secure integration of OGC Services as Support Services 

As Support Services are not consumed by clients controlled by humans, it is important to 

enable a fully automatic find & bind & execute. For protected OGC Web Services, we 

think it is important to start discussions if this is fully supported and how specifications 



OGC 10-155 

20 Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  
 

need to be adopted to ensure the approach. This includes the description of service 

endpoints including security conditions, how to bind and execute including error 

handling. It is important to describe how a service chain can undertake rollback if 

possible to prevent harm to assets. 

 Authentication  

In contrast to Interaction Services, the use of OGC Web Services as Support 

Services requires to maintain the identity of different entities that take part in the 

workflow and make the identity available to services down the chain. Another 

aspect for workflows is the support for “on behalf” statements. We understand 

that both requirements can be supported by using SOAP + WS-Security or WS-

Trust as outlined in The System’s architecture. 

The implication to OGC standardization is to ensure that for Support Services, the 

use of the SOAP header is no limited. We actually like to recommend that SOAP 

interfaces support WS-Security and allow whatever the WS-Security specification 

allows. 

 Access Control 

As Support Services are consumed by other services, it is required that service 

exceptions that result from missing access rights and the follow-up processing are 

standardized. In particular, we think it is mandatory to define the actions to be 

undertaken by the calling service in order to either report the failure to the end 

user or to automatically recover from the failure and proceed. 

We recommend that OGC standardization addresses these issues for the next 

revision of service specifications. 

 Non-repudiation 

For SOAP messages, direct mechanisms exist for implementing non-repudiation, 

or at least to extend messages as such that non-repudiation becomes possible. 

We like to recommend that the OGC community discusses the issue and evaluate 

a consensus of how to enable non-repudiation for workflows. We see this topic 

inside the Workflow or Decision Support DWG.   

 Confidentiality 

For services that support SOAP interfaces, it is possible to ensure confidentiality 

for the request and response message itself, independent from security provided 

by the underlying communication protocol. 

In order to ensure that confidentiality can be applied to SOAP (request and 

response) messages, we recommend that the OGC standardization provides 

support for WS-Security. 



OGC 10-155 

Copyright © 2010 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc.  21 
 

 Integrity 

Same as confidentiality. 

 Security Audits and Alarms 

As a Security Audits and Alarms for Interaction Services. 

 Availability 

For SOAP based interfaces, we think it extremely important to define common 

rules for the verification of service requests to ensure prevention or strong 

mitigation of corrupted requests that aim to reduce the availability of the service.
