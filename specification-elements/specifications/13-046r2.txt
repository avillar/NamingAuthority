Preface 

The CHISP-1 initiative was conducted as a Pilot initiative, which is a collaborative effort 
that applies technology elements from the OGC Technical Baseline and other (non-OGC) 
technologies to address Sponsor requirements and scenarios.  

OGC Pilot initiatives are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate standards into OGC's Standards Program, where they are formalized for public 
release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, international teams of technology providers 
work together to solve specific geo-processing interoperability problems posed by the 
Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, 
pilot projects, interoperability experiments and interoperability support services - all 
designed to encourage rapid development, testing, validation and adoption of OGC 
standards. 

This report summarizes the results of OGC’s Climatology-Hydrology Information 
Sharing Pilot, Phase 1 (CHISP-1). The objective of this initiative was to develop an inter-
disciplinary, inter-agency and international virtual observatory system for water resources 
information from observations in the U.S. and Canada, building on current networks and 
capabilities. 

The CHISP-1 Initiative was designed to support these Use Case functions: 

 Hydrologic modeling for historical and current stream flow and groundwater 
conditions 

 Modeling and assessment of nutrient load into the Great Lakes

OGC® CHISP-1 Summary Engineering Report 

Summary of OGC Climatology-Hydrology Information 
Sharing Pilot, Phase 1 (CHISP-1) 

1 Overview 

The Climatology-Hydrology Information Sharing Pilot, Phase 1 (CHISP-1) was an 
initiative of OGC’s Interoperability Program. The Pilot was a collaborative effort that 
applied technology elements from the OGC Technical Baseline and other (non-OGC) 
technologies to Sponsor scenarios. The Pilot was conducted to “stress test” a set of OGC 
standards based on real-world application and experience. The majority of work for 
CHISP-1 was conducted from November 2012 through April 2013, with the following 
outcomes: 

 18 Components were developed or deployed for the Pilot to demonstrate system 
functions and interoperability by participants and sponsor organizations 

 An Engineering Report (ER) was prepared to capture the technical architecture, 
description of the system functions developed to address Sponsor provided Use 
Cases, and Lessons-learned along with recommendations for Next Steps.  

 A live presentation and demonstration was conducted in the form of a public 
webinar, hosted and broadcast by Directions Media, on 16 April 2013. Recording 
of the webinar is available for review by the public here: 
http://www.directionsmag.com/webinars/view/ogc-update-results-of-the-climate-
hydrologic-information-sharing-pilot/318678 

 10 organizations were involved in the CHISP-1 initiative consisting of 3 
participants and 7 sponsor organizations. Additionally, a number of other 
organizations were observers on the project. 

 7 sponsoring organizations defined requirements for CHISP-1. The sponsors’ 
requirements were recorded in a set of RFQ/CFP documents that were released by 
OGC seeking organizations that wished to participate in the project.

4 Development Objective and Results 

The objective of this initiative was to develop an inter-disciplinary, inter-agency and 
international virtual observatory system for water resources information from 
observations in the U.S. and Canada, building on current networks and capabilities. 

The CHISP-1 Initiative was designed to support these Use Case functions: 

 Hydrologic modeling for historical and current stream flow and groundwater 
conditions. Integrate trans-boundary stream flow and groundwater well data, as well 
as national river networks (US NHD and Canada NHN) from multiple agencies with 
emphasis on time series data encoded as WaterML2 and real-time flood monitoring.  

 Modeling and assessment of nutrient load into the Great Lakes.  Access water-quality 
data from multiple agencies and integrate with stream flow information for 
calculating nutrient loads.  Emphasis was on discrete sampled water quality 
observations, linking those to specific NHD stream reaches and catchments, and 
additional metadata for sampled data. 

4.1 CHISP-1 Engineering Report 

The detailed technical results for the CHISP-1 initiative are documented in the following 
Engineering Report 

 OGC 13-053, CHISP-1 Engineering Report 

4.2 CHISP-1 Scenarios Use Cases 

The following paragraphs describe in more detail the Use Cases developed in the 
CHISP-1 pilot. 

4.2.1 Hydrologic modeling for historical and current stream flow and groundwater 
conditions 

This scenario focuses on accessing river gage and groundwater well information 
associated with a river network that in turn is associated with a set of basins (watersheds). 
Millions of stream gages and well monitors have been installed throughout the U.S. and 
Canada, reporting continuous values of depth, flow rate and/or other parameters, as time 
series. The purpose of this use case is to provide seamless access and interoperability of 
this data across the U.S.-Canada border.  

Several water catchment basins cross this border. The Pilot region considered two basins 
with portions in both the U.S. and Canada.  The Milk River basin includes parts of 
Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Montana (Figure 1) and the Souris River basin includes parts 
of Manitoba, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan (Figure 2)

The Souris River flows into the Assiniboine River, then into the Red River and Lake 
Winnipeg, which is part of the Hudson Bay. The Souris River basin shows the locations 
of stream gauges as green circles (source: http://nd.water.usgs.gov/floodinfo/souris.html).

The CHISP-1 Pilot initiative selected the Milk River as the area of interest to focus on 
services and data to support the Use Case scenario. More specifically, this Use Case 
focused on exchanging cross-border hydrologic data (stream flow and groundwater 
levels) with a unified alert service. Stream/river gauge and groundwater well locations 
associated with a river network and in turn associated with a set of basins (watersheds).  
For any well or stream gauge location, a web service was developed to provide access to 
the gauge and well information on all upstream stream segments or in all contributing 
basins.  An event service was developed to provide subscribers with a notification if any 
upstream streamflow or well water level reaches or exceeds a user-defined threshold.  
The selected Milk River basin crosses the U.S./Canada border. Data providers were 
identified and selected from include provincial and federal agencies. Based on sensor 
events, a flood is determined to be imminent and alert is generated for distribution to 
authorities in the affected areas. 

4.2.2 Architecture – Upstream Monitoring and Event Notification Scenario  

The CHISP-1 system architecture for this Use Case is represented in the following 
diagram.

4.2.3 Modeling and assessment of nutrient load into the Great Lakes 

This scenario focuses on calculating nutrient loads (particularly Nitrogen and 
Phosphorus) flowing into the Great Lakes from tributaries (e.g., via hydrologic 
pathways), using web-accessible inputs of water quality observations and flow rates. The 
system produces web-accessible outputs of known nutrient loads that includes metadata 
to document the model output and processing steps. The project focused on the Lake 
Ontario basins as shown in the following diagram.

5 Achievements 

Highlights of significant results achieved for this CHISP-1 initiative included: 

 For the first time, provided a capability for an EM Analyst (or anyone) to view 
trans-boundary upstream hydrometric (and groundwater) data via the web in near 
real-time. 

 Developed a capability to monitor all available upstream stations independent of 
location or jurisdiction to generate an alert in case of flood and/or drought. 



 OGC 13-046r2 

Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 11 
 

 Developed and demonstrated use of the GetDataAvailability (GDA) operation for 
SOS v2 for retrieval of time-series WaterML2 encoded stream flow data. 

 Demonstrated interoperability through integration of SOS, WPS, WNS, and CSW 
services along with the OASIS CAP standard to provide near real-time threshold 
monitoring and notification to support alert mechanisms across international 
boundary and jurisdictions. 

 Implemented a single SOS service to monitor cross-border international water 
quality sample data. 

 Demonstrated integration and interoperability of international data services using 
the SOS and WaterML2 for stream flow and water quality data in order to execute 
a web-based nutrient load model. 

 Implemented a system to identify upstream water level and flow gauges 
regardless of relation to US/CAN border. 

 Implemented a Harvester capability to automatically retrieve and store time-series 
WaterML2 data for streamflow and water level; and to identify if an identified 
threshold value had been reached on a near real-time basis. 

6 Future work. 

Outcomes and achievements in this CHISP-1 initiative suggested several potential future 
work areas, which are described in the following sections. 

6.1 Catalogue 

This project used the ISO profile of the OGC Catalogue specification.  Such a catalogue 
is specifically designed to maintain metadata about services, data and their relationship.  
During the CHISP-1 project however, it was clear that other objects and relationships 
needed to be catalogued.  For example, metadata about gauge stations and their 
relationship to the hydrographic network needed to be maintained and accessed and this 
was not easily handled using an ISO based catalogue.  A future work item would thus be 
to investigate using the CSW-ebRIM catalogue, which includes a rich set of structures for 
cataloguing objects of all kinds, classifying those objects according to any classification 
scheme and maintaining arbitrary associations between those objects. 

6.2 Big Data Handling 

During this project an SOS profile was developed which, among other things, was 
designed to compensate for shortcomings in the SOS standard related to handling large 
networks of sensors.  For example, in situations where large networks of sensors are 
made accessible via SOS, managing the capabilities document of these services becomes 
cumbersome because the content section can become quite large.  A future work item 



OGC 13-046r2 CHISP-1 Summary Engineering Report 

12 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

would be to enhance the SOS standard to handle large networks of sensors.  This would 
include work in enhancing the GetCapabilities operation to allows large content sections 
to be accessed more efficiently – perhaps employing paging or some simple query 
capability to limit the number of items appearing in the response. 

6.3 Semantic Mediation 

The nutrient load calculation use case illustrated a need that commonly arises in cross-
border projects and this is the need for semantic mediation of information.  An example 
of this was the need to mediate analyte names.  During the CHISP-1 project a SPARQL 
server was deployed to investigate its use in this mediation role.  However, the server was 
never populated and so a future work item would be to complete the integration of the 
SPARQL server into the system. 

6.4 Service Performance 

The CHISP-1 project deployed a large number of services that interacted with each other.  
Some of these services were not stable resulting in frequent service outages and 
connection problems with required robust exception handling.  This was particularly true 
for components that operated on a periodic basis such as the Harvester module. A future 
work item would be to (a) determine why the underlying services were having 
performance and stability issues and (b) consider more fault tolerant system designs. 

6.5 Subscription Client Improvements 

The following enhancements could be considered for the web-based subscription client: 

 Include a search box to allow geo-search by name (e.g. user enters “Milk River” 
and map zooms to Milk river area) 

 The current set of data sources presented on the map is fixed and displayed in a 
legend in the upper right.  Allow sources to be dynamically discovered and added 
to the map and make the legend dynamic to reflect which sources are currently 
being displayed. 

 Suggestion capability – when creating a subscription it would be useful if the 
web-based subscription client could access historical information to suggest 
values for the various input parameters. 

6.6 Event Notification Service (ENS) Enhancements 

The CHISP-1 project has only considered subscription and notification via a web-based 
browser client and email.  However, there are many other standards that might be useful 
in real world situations.  Some examples include GeoSMS (see OGC 11-030r1), that can 
send notification via SMS and can include all the spatial information that a subscriber 
needs to know; GeoPackage (see OGC 12-128r1), a draft standard that allows mobile 
applications to describe and store spatial information locally in a user’s mobile devices;

Geosync. (see OGC 10-069r1), that allows users to sync in-situ information back to 
emergency management centers for further integration. 

6.7 Nutrient Load Calculation Model 

Because of issues with data availability and sparseness on the Canadian side, a simple 
and ultimately non-scientifically correct model was used in the CHISP-1 project to 
compute nutrient load.  This approach – while yielding invalid results -- allowed us to 
show that OGC services could be used to (a) provide the data to drive the model and (b) 
make the model available as a service via WPS.  A future work item would be to enhance 
the model to account for the sparseness of observation and thus generate scientifically 
valid results.
