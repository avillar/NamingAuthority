Preface 

Water resources, weather, and natural disasters are not constrained by local, regional or national 
boundaries. Effective research, planning, and response to major events call for increasing 
coordination and data sharing among many organizations, with the potential for these important 
economic benefits: 

• Improved coordination for disaster response; 
• Reduced cost of software development, training, maintenance; 
• Improved scalability, flexibility, and security from using modern architectures; and 
• Access to extensive industry expertise, mentoring, tools & practices. 

The necessary coordination would include agreement on conventions and policies for interoperable 
data exchange that work across jurisdictions, not just national-state-regional-local boundaries and 
agencies, but transcontinental. Trans-jurisdictional data sharing raises issues around handling multiple 
languages, as well as differing laws and customs for privacy, security, and rights management. The 
more technical challenges for achieving effective software and data interoperability include the 
design and maintenance of an adaptive, scalable, dependable architecture of distributed web services, 
information models and encodings, that support discovery and access for very large and very different 
types of data collections, even having different classification systems and meanings. All this is quite 
demanding, but increasingly urgent for managing water and other critical environmental resources.  

The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) has 
conducted significant, extensive research and development addressing these challenges within the 
United States since 2004, with support from the National Science Foundation. The CUAHSI 
Hydrologic Information System (HIS) project has greatest focus on time-series observations of water 
resource variables at point locations throughout the U.S., as well as gridded precipitation and other 
related weather data to support hydrologic and other analytical modeling. HIS began with a focus on 
harmonizing data across U.S. agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Water 
Information System (NWIS), the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Water Quality Exchange 
(WQX) and STOrage and RETrieval (STORET) data warehouse, and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Climate Data Center (NCDC).  Even as the initial 
implementations of CUAHSI HIS were gaining acceptance and support from the U.S. agencies, it 
became evident that CUAHSI needed to align itself with the broader international geospatial data 
exchange standards community.  

Based on sponsorship from CUAHSI, the OGC Interoperability Program conducted a Water 
Information Services Concept Development Study (Water IS CDS) from January through April 2011.  
The study was presented to the OGC HDWG.  This report presents the findings of this study, and 
recommendations for further work.  This document is anticipated to serve as the starting point to 
define future OGC Interoperability Program initiatives.

OGC® Engineering Report: Water Information Services  
Concept Development Study 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope  

The purpose of this report is to recommend appropriate architectures and procedures for 
migrating the CUAHSI HIS to the OGC-based WaterML 2.0 encoding (profile of OGC 
O&M standard) and OGC web services such as Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Web 
Feature Service (WFS), Web Mapping Service (WMS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and 
Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW).  This report may be used as the basis for future OGC 
Interoperability Program initiatives. 

The report includes draft guidelines for five general use cases: publishing, 
cataloguing, discovering, accessing, and processing time series and point observations of 
hydrologic data using OGC encodings and web service standards. These guidelines reflect 
experience gained from operational prototypes handling large, federated catalogues and 
datasets of U.S. state and national agencies’ current holdings, primarily for point 
observations (continuous time series) of surface water discharge.  

This report is intended primarily for providers of water resources data in the United States, 
such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 
National Water Information System (NWIS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), corresponding state level 
agencies and university research facilities (e.g. NSF supported observatories. Support for 
multiple languages and other international considerations are not discussed here, however 
these are being considered in other OGC HDWG activities, such as the Groundwater 
Interoperability Experiment (GWIE) and the Surface Water Interoperability Experiment 
(SWIE). It is hoped this Concept Development Study and report will be of interest outside 
the U.S. for international organizations, agencies, universities and research organizations 
who collect water data and who wish to make the data broadly available.  The intended 
audience also includes data consumers who need to discover, access and integrate data 
from multiple sources in studies related to hydrologic science and water resources 
management, and developers building applications to support these functions.   

1.2 Study Approach 

Given this background of experience, limitations, and intended audience, the current study 
and report seek to address the following set of requirements, as expressed by the key 
stakeholders among government agencies and users.   

1. Transition to OGC model for better interoperability, including international: what is 
the suggested path, what are new service interfaces, and what may be missing from 
this proposed reference model? The study provides a crosswalk between water data

OGC 11-013r6 

3

encodings and services implemented in CUAHSI HIS (including WaterOneFlow 
services and HIS Central services) and OGC standard service interfaces.  

2. Federation of catalogues for scalability, and since many data providers stand up 
catalogs: what is the suggested combination of catalogue technologies and interfaces? 
The study identifies certain interoperability issues between key commercial and open 
source catalogue services. We also suggest appropriate conditions for using WFS as a 
metadata server, and example portal user interfaces to support federated queries.  

3. Efficient data discovery, recognizing that we don’t need to search over all services: 
what are the most appropriate search patterns? This study identifies a 3-step 
approach: identify services, perhaps by thematic content or provider; then extract time 
series metadata; and then request data content for the time series.  

4. Cultural and institutional integration and governance, recognizing that we can (and 
need to) rely on common implementations of mature, modular standard 
specifications: what is an appropriate operational governance model for distribution 
of roles and responsibilities within such a modular system? This includes supporting 
mandated data management roles and policies; maintaining data integrity, quality, and 
provenance throughout aggregation and semantic mapping processes; and enabling 
new data and service providers and consumers to join the system as simply as 
possible. 

Two phases of the initiative are envisaged.  Phase 1 is the Concept Development Study 
reported here. Phase 2 is anticipated to be an OGC Interoperability Program pilot initiative to 
implement, test and refine the architecture and design choices described here, possibly 
resulting in profiles and/or change requests to one or more OGC standards. The study and the 
pilot will reduce risks and help engage federal agencies and others towards the 
implementation of standard web services for hydrologic data.

2 Introducing CUAHSI HIS and RM-ODP 

This report primarily relies on the experience developing the CUAHSI Hydrologic 
Information System (HIS). At the same time, it takes into account other related developments 
of service architecture for water data, in particular those undertaken in the course of OGC 
Interoperability initiatives, to present alternative solutions in information models, service 
interfaces, and implementation choices.  

The CUAHSI HIS is an Internet-based system for sharing hydrologic data. It is comprised of 
databases and servers connected through web services to client applications, allowing for the 
publication, discovery, and access of data. CUAHSI HIS is based on a Service Oriented 
Architecture (SOA) where catalogues help mediate across data providers and data consumers 
(Figure 1). 

 

Figure 1 – Water Data Services Architecture 

The functionality illustrated in Figure 1 follows the general publish-find-bind paradigm of 
the Internet:  data providers publish metadata about data content and services to web-based 
catalogs; data consumers can then discover these datasets and services by querying the 
catalogs, and receive enough information to access (bind) the desired data content. 
Additional processing support may be provided to providers, catalogs and consumers as 
needed.  

Data providers include federal, regional, state, local, international, and non-governmental 
organizations; universities; research teams; and volunteers. Consumers of hydrologic data 
include hydrologists, scientists, engineers, researchers, planners, decision-makers, students, 
and any other parties interested in retrieving data about the water environment.  Consumers 
rely on desktop or web-based client applications to facilitate searching in catalogues 
accessing data services, analyzing and using the data.

OGC 11-013r6

Catalogues support data discovery based on indexed metadata, similar to the way search 
engines support the discovery of Internet content.  A catalogue provides a centralized registry 
of services and descriptive metadata about the data that is published through those services.  
Catalogues also provide a searchable interface so that data consumers can discover the data 
in which they are interested.   

Any one of the three corner nodes in Figure 1 is a simplification, and could involve multiple 
components & processes for transformations, mediation, brokering, and other functions, as 
indicated by the processing node shown in the model.  

To support this architecture there are four main categories of web services in this services-
oriented architecture (SOA): 

• Data Services – provide the interface to access the data from the data provider   
• Metadata Services – provide the interface to convey the metadata about a web service 

to a catalogue.  
• Search Services – provide the interface to allow consumers to search, discover and 

assess applicability of services of interest. The catalogue provides the metadata for 
accessing the data using data services.   

• Processing Services – provide specific functionality for operations on the data, such 
as for semantic mediation, transformations, language support, etc., assuming that such 
operations and their execution can be reasonably factored and distributed over the 
Internet.  

 

Note that there may be overlap between data services and metadata services, in that what 
could be considered metadata in one context could also be seen as data in another context. 
We will try to distinguish between these as needed for clarity.   

Fundamental to the architecture in Figure 1 is the information model and community support 
infrastructure upon which the system is founded.  The information model comprises the 
conceptual and logical models used to organize and define sufficient metadata about 
hydrologic observations for them to be unambiguously interpreted and used.  The 
information model is based on the CUAHSI Observations Data Model (ODM) (Horsburgh et 
al., 2008; Tarboton et al., 2008) that was developed through a comprehensive survey and 
review process (Bandaragoda et al., 2005; Tarboton, 2005) to identify the data and metadata 
required to provide sufficient and unambiguous description of point water observations in the 
hydrology domain.  

A widely used approach for building a SOA for geospatial information is based on the 
Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) [ISO/IEC 10746-1:1998], 
illustrated in Figure 2. We have already mentioned concepts such as information models, 
web services, and service architectures. The RM-ODP provides a well-structured approach 
for relating these concepts in a given system. The first step is to define the community 
objectives in an Enterprise Viewpoint, to describe in a broad way why the effort is being 
undertaken, and its scope and objectives. This is aided by defining a set of use cases that 
describe how producers and consumers of data services perform their required functions. The 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

second step involves a pairing of an information viewpoint and a computational viewpoint, 
which are complimentary to one another in the sense that the Information Viewpoint presents 
a set of conceptual models that describe the information (metadata and data) elements and 
how they will be encoded, while the Computational Viewpoint describes the interfaces by 
which service consumers interact with service providers.  These viewpoints provide an 
inventory of concepts to be used in the system architecture. The Engineering Viewpoint then 
describes the architecture as a whole and how the information models and services relate to 
each other. The Technology Viewpoint completes the description with the physical 
implementation of specific software, network and hardware components. 

 

Figure 2 – Geospatial Service Architecture Viewpoints 

This Concept Development Study focuses on the Enterprise, Information, Computational and 
Engineering Viewpoints. The study will not cover the Technology viewpoint, which would 
typically be based on final implementation of the complete architecture.  

3 Enterprise Viewpoint: Water Information Community 

3.1 Overview  

As scientists and water resource managers begin to investigate complex hydrologic processes 
at expanding spatial and temporal scales, integration of data from multiple agencies, sources, 
projects, and research efforts is becoming more important. At the same time, data volumes 
are rapidly growing and changing in structure with advancements in sensor and other data 
collection and storage technologies. In a world of increasing availability and desire to use 
massive amounts of data, people need sophisticated data integration strategies to address the 
following key issues: 

pyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 6
 



OGC 11-013r6 

7

• Difficulty in discovering data: Most data published on the Internet are not inherently 
discoverable using traditional web search capabilities because they are generally 
encapsulated within files or databases, the contents of which cannot easily be 
discovered or catalogued by web crawler technologies employed by major web search 
engines. 

• Data heterogeneity: Syntactic and semantic heterogeneity in data from different 
sources make data integration and synthesis difficult, and data are rarely annotated 
with sufficient attribute information, or metadata, to make their interpretation 
unambiguous by investigators other than those who collected the data. 

 

The challenges of data organization and publication are different for government agencies 
and research organizations such as universities.  In the U.S., major government agencies that 
hold hydrologic data are the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), National Weather Service (NWS), 
Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), 
and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  Each of these typically has one or more of its own (often-
complex) internal data management systems. These agencies are mandated to make their data 
available to consumers, under specific scope (e.g., excluding sensitive areas), procedural 
(e.g., data collected according to approved set of protocols and meeting certain accuracy or 
detection standards) and/or currency/timeliness constraints. 

The Open Government Initiative and the creation of the Federal Geographic Data Committee 
are good exemplars of mandates related to data publishing in the U.S. The Open Government 
Initiative (Orszag, 2009) mandates agencies in the U.S. to make available information online, 
improve the quality of information and foster the culture of open government. Previously an 
executive order (Clinton, 1994) mandated the use of standards and created the Federal 
Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).  Agency requirements include: 

• Making data available in open and standard formats; 
• Making data available at useful and meaningful granularities or scales;  
• Making data available with consideration for privacy, confidentiality and other 

restrictions. 
Research organizations, on the other hand, are less likely to have established data 
management systems. University research often results in the accumulation of valuable data 
that may languish in the files of the investigators.  Recognizing this problem, the U.S. 
National Science Foundation (NSF) now mandates that NSF-funded studies have a data 
management plan. This is critical for large interdisciplinary projects that are increasing in the 
hydrology domain. These include Critical Zone Observatories and Water Sustainability and 
Climate Observatories where NSF has recently (last four years) funded establishment of six 
and four of these integrated study observatories, respectively.  With a mandate for data 
collected in these studies to be published soon (usually within at most two years) after 
collection, there is a need for effective, standards-based data publication capability that 
universities and other research organizations can use, including ability to: 

• Make data available promptly; 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

• Make data available following standards; 
• Make it easier for other scientists to discover and use data. 

 
3.2 Use Cases 

This Concept Development Study considers both government agency and research 
organization cases. It takes into account data consumer and data provider needs. An example 
of an application that provides integration of data server and data consumer needs is 
presented in Figure 3. This shows a user’s client software application displaying possible 
data providers (Who), variables (What), and locations (Where) of hydrologic observations 
series in a map.  In this instance, there are two federated catalogues of information that are 
being searched – one at the CUAHSI HIS Central located at the San Diego Supercomputer 
Center (SDSC) which identifies federal water data (e.g., USGS, USACE), and the other at 
The University of Texas at Austin, which identifies data published by Texas state water 
agencies.  The application searches across both catalogues to identify dissolved oxygen data 
within an area of interest. This represents a simple case of federated catalogue search and 
access, in which the Texas state and U.S. Federal (HIS Central) catalogues are known to the 
user’s desktop client application. In a more general application, the client software may need 
to discover new data providers and associated content. 

 

Figure 3 – Hydrologic Data Client Software Application 

The following primary use cases have been chosen for discussion. It’s worth considering that 
these all reflect a fundamental desire or need to “re-purpose data.” This brings into focus the 
need to identify and describe original data well enough to support each and all of these 
operations without loss of information or quality.

1. Publication – make data and their associated metadata available using web services.  
2. Catalogue – aggregate metadata from published web services. 
3. Discovery – search a catalogue to identify data series or datasets of interest. 
4. Access – acquire the selected data from the web service.   
5. Processing – apply statistical or other processing routines to a dataset, such as 

aggregating time series data to a common time step.   
 
The Publication use case describes the situation where a water agency or researcher wishes to 
make water and hydrologic data along with descriptive metadata available online through a 
service. The number of publishers is unlimited and ultimately in the United States may 
extend to thousands of state and local water agencies, utilities, research groups, and even 
public volunteers (consider the Open Street Map project).   

The Cataloguing use case describes registration of published water data services (from Use 
Case 1) in a service registry, accompanied by harvesting of service or dataset metadata to 
enable subsequent data search and access. The catalogues may be organized by geographic 
and/or subject areas of interest, and reference other catalogues.  Catalogue information shall 
be accessible via web services from different applications, which may include an online 
discovery portal. There will most likely be national aggregation catalogues, such as that 
provided by CUAHSI HIS Central, as well as regional and thematic catalogues hosted by 
individual state and local agencies and other organizations. 

The Discovery use case refers to a consumer of the data who searches the metadata in a 
particular catalogue or across catalogues to identify data series or datasets of interest. The 
Access use case describes how the consumer downloads data for use on his/her local 
machine. An example of a specific discovery/access request might be to find and download 
spatially and temporally coincident observations of surface water nitrogen and stream flow 
with at least 100 days of values at a given location.  

Finally, the Processing use case involves chaining of data publication, cataloguing, discovery 
or access services into workflows, to carry out analytical, statistical, and other kinds of 
operations on the data or metadata at varying granularities.  

The scope of the use cases presented here are based primarily on common uses of the 
CUAHSI HIS, with published hydrologic data comprising time series of water measurements 
made at a network of observation sites. Other organizing principles or constraints on the use 
cases include the following: 

• The published hydrologic data values or datasets may be grouped in regular or 
irregular time series, which may be further grouped into higher-level constructs such 
as hydrologic themes (time series collections).  

• The data publication case covers publication of both primary (raw) measurements 
and derived or aggregated products (e.g., themes). 

• Both real-time measurements and historical time series (organized and stored on the 
server) can be made accessible via a standard set of services. 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

• Besides the core metadata elements specifying where and when the measurements 
are taken, what is measured, by whom, and how; additional metadata elements may 
be included, depending on the publisher’s metadata model and publication mandate 
(e.g., rating curves). 

 

Caveats: These use cases are general enough to apply to other types of data actively being 
used in hydrologic research: (1) time series of gridded radar rainfall values; (2) multi-
dimensional arrays in space and time, such as the output of climate models, or a set of 
products derived from remote sensing; (3) static geospatial datasets, such as LIDAR data for 
an experimental watershed. However, these types of datasets would involve additional 
infrastructure components (for example query tools for grids, or publication tools for multi-
dimensional arrays) that are not considered in the proposed architecture. 

This study and report do not address certain known issues that will need to be considered for 
any subsequent implementation project. One of these issues is to handle semantic differences 
among the data sources. The major data providers, such as the USGS, EPA, and NCDC, have 
many observational variables in common, but use different classifications and coding 
schemes for the definitions and data values. It is impractical to expect or require all agencies 
to agree on a single, universal data model. A solution to this was built into the initial design 
of CUAHSI HIS Central by establishing a common ontology for water resources, and 
mapping the various data providers’ unique ontologies to this in advance. This enables users 
to search for data content based on the common ontology, and rely on HIS Central’s 
mappings to find the correct records across all the data providers, without the user having to 
know the differences in ontologies and query syntax required among the various data 
sources. This greatly simplifies the user’s experience. The addition of a new data source 
and/or provider would require advance registration of any new ontology, with guidelines to 
enable consistent query capability across all supported data sources. However, the best way 
to migrate this capability to the OGC standards framework will require further investigation 
that could not be accomplished during the current study. This kind of capability is a matter of 
current research and development in OWS-8, which should provide useful guidelines in time 
for a future Water Information System implementation project.  

Other issues to be considered are to handle metadata and data content having multiple 
different languages, and with potentially different symbology styles, which would be 
required for international data sharing applications. These are being considered in other OGC 
interoperability projects as well, and should be feasible to factor into a subsequent Water 
Information System implementation project. 

Another capability not considered in this study is to support forecasting applications. This 
would involve additional temporal fields in the information model, and patterns for usage. 
This is a subject being considered for a future interoperability experiment as a joint project 
between the OGC Hydrology Domain Working Group (HDWG) and Met-Ocean DWG.   

The following tables organize and describe the five key use cases considered in this study.

Table 1 – Use Case 1: Publication 

Overview 

Title Hydrologic Data Service Publication 

Description A provider of hydrologic data publishes data and corresponding 
descriptive metadata using standards-based web services. Metadata 
should conform to a standard metadata specification.  The data 
publisher may wish to control access to both data and metadata.   

Actors  • Hydrologic data service provider 

Initial Status 
and 
Preconditions 

• Hydrologic data service provider stores hydrologic data and 
metadata, such as a database, structured data files, or a small 
memory device in a sensor. 

• Hydrologic data service provider has web services for data and 
metadata access, or can make a data resource available on the 
web. 

• A hydrology metadata model(s) comprising structural metadata 
elements, shared vocabulary, and discovery ontology concepts is 
in place. The metadata models include description for services, 
description for granule (time series, layers, etc.) and for variable 
types and value ranges. 

• A hydrology data model (schema) to convey the data is 
established. 

• A hydrologic data service provider has a policy and procedures 
for making data available, including appropriate workflows for 
quality assurance, access control rules, and guidelines for post-
processing of data that may be required. 

Basic Flow 

1. The data provider selects a standard web service interface, a standard data 
encoding, a standard metadata model, and relevant control vocabularies.  

2. The data provider establishes a system to associate its data store into corresponding 
structural elements of the standard data and metadata models, including using 
appropriate shared vocabularies and discovery ontology concepts.   

3. The data provider sets up standards-based web services on a host web server for 
accessing its hydrologic data and metadata which complies with its own policies 
and procedures. 

4. Data access constraints are established and appropriate rules for controlling access 
are set up on the host web server. 

Post Condition 

A data provider’s data and descriptive metadata are available on a web server.  The data 
and metadata are accessible using standard web service interfaces.  The metadata 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

content includes shared vocabulary and discovery ontology concepts to ensure that the 
data can be catalogued and discovered.  Appropriate access control rules have been 
established for the data and metadata and are enforced by the publication web services.  

 

Table 2 – Use Case 2: Cataloguing 

pyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium

Overview 

Title Hydrologic Data Service Cataloguing 

Description A data provider registers data web services to a service catalogue 
by providing the data service end point or link to the data.  
Descriptive metadata about the data location or data service and 
information about how to access it is made available to the 
catalogue.  The catalogue has automated harvesting capability to 
periodically refresh and update the content to ensure that it 
maintains a current description of the registered services and the 
data that each service provides. 

Actors  • Hydrologic data service provider 
• Catalogue service provider 

Initial Status 
and 
Preconditions 

• One or more web services that provide water related data and 
metadata have been published on a web server by a data provider 
(as in the Publication use case). 

Basic Flow 

1. The data provider identifies a catalogue for registering the provider’s data service. 
2. The data provider registers its data and metadata service in the catalogue by 

providing a link to the web service method that describes the web service’s 
capabilities. The metadata required to describe a web service are defined by an 
agreed-upon metadata standard for the hydrologic community and are retrieved 
automatically by the catalogue from the service’s capabilities web service method. 

3. The catalogue harvests metadata from the registered service to support subsequent 
queries. 

4. The catalogue exposes all of the metadata that it has harvested and compiled about 
registered web services through a web service interface that can be searched by 
client software applications. 
 

Post Condition 

A data provider’s services are registered in a catalogue.  The catalogue has harvested 
the metadata for a data provider’s service.  The catalogue is queryable and accessible by 
data consumers over the Internet. The catalogue is searchable using several criteria, or 
facets, that enable data consumers to narrow search results.  The catalogue can be

indexed by other catalogues or meta-catalogues.  

 

Table 3 – Use Case 3: Discovery 

Overview 

Title Hydrologic Data Discovery 

Description A data consumer wishes to find hydrologic data of any of the types 
listed in Section 4.2.1 “Hydrologic Data” that meet a number of 
search criteria.  Search criteria will generally follow a who-what-
when-where pattern, and the following are specific search criteria 
that will be supported: 

Who:  Find data from a particular data source (e.g., originating 
agency), project (e.g., scientific experiment in a watershed), or 
service (e.g., a particular data service instance). 

What:  Find data for one or more particular variables or concepts 
from the hydrologic ontology. This may include derived data, such 
as mean daily values, where data providers offer results of server-
based operations. 

When:  Find data that fall within a specified temporal window with 
a specified frequency. 

Where:  Find data within a particular geographic bounding box, 
named region, or region type.  

The data consumer may specify one or more of these criteria 
together within a single search.  The data consumer may also wish 
to filter and subset the results of a query to further refine search 
results.  

Actors  • Hydrologic data consumer 
• Catalogue service provider 

Initial Status 
and 
Preconditions 

Water related data services from multiple data providers have been 
published online using standard service interfaces and standard data 
transmission languages.  The data published by these services have 
been semantically annotated using the shared vocabularies and 
discovery ontology.  The published services have been registered 
with a catalogue, and the catalogue has compiled metadata 
describing the services that is searchable by the data consumer.   

Basic Flow 

1. A data consumer uses a client application to build a query that includes one or more 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

of the search criteria described above.   
2. The client application executes the query against the search web services provided 

by the catalogue. 
3. The catalogue handles the query request and assembles a set of metadata records 

matching the query criteria that will be sent back to the data consumer.  The 
published ontology is used to mediate the client application’s vocabulary in the 
query to match that of the data service.   

4. Metadata records for services that contain datasets that meet the criteria of the data 
consumer’s query are returned and displayed in the client application.   

5. The data consumer using the client application may then further filter and refine the 
query results. The client application will refine the results by further interacting 
with the catalogue or directly with the data provider web services. 

Post Condition 

Search results containing metadata about the hydrologic data that meet a data 
consumer’s search criteria are returned.  Search results returned to the data consumer 
contain references to the data access services that provide the actual data of interest and 
contain enough information that the data consumer can retrieve the data using their 
client application.  Search results also contain enough information to enable data 
consumers to refine search results.  

 

Note: In handling the discovery use case, it is necessary to consider the potential for “huge” 
responses in terms of the number of datasets in answer to a given query. With millions of 
water resource gauges and sampling sites in the U.S., each collecting numerous variables and 
covering numerous time series intervals, the number of total datasets is currently on the order 
of 23 million. Just keeping the metadata harvesting up to date presents a large task. 
Performance and scalability must be considered in addressing this use case. Approaches to 
this implementation are presented in detail later in this report.   

Table 4 – Use Case 4: Access 

Overview 

Title Hydrologic Data Access 

Description A data consumer retrieves a hydrologic dataset from a specific data 
provider’s web service, subject to filter criteria (what-when-where). 
This may include raw or derived data, with historical or real-time 
values.  

Actors  • Hydrologic data consumer 
• Hydrologic data service provider 

Initial Status 
and 

Hydrologic data have been previously published online in a 
consistent format through a standard service protocol.  A data

Preconditions consumer has discovered a particular dataset that (s)he wants to 
download.  The data consumer has obtained metadata describing 
how and where to get the dataset.  If the data require authorization 
for access, the data consumer has obtained necessary permission to 
retrieve the data. 

Basic Flow 

1. A data consumer uses a client application to connect to a data provider’s web 
service.   

2. Access and authorization to the data and data service is negotiated between data 
consumer client and data provider service. 

3. The web service address and parameters used to retrieve the data have been 
previously obtained through the data discovery process (as in Use Case 3), or 
mediated through introspection of the data service, or the researcher may manually 
enter the required information. 

4. The data consumer may specify filter criteria (what-when-where parameters) for 
which data from the service are desired. If processing steps are needed to generate 
the desired data, these are carried out. 

5. Data that meet the requested parameters are used by the client application for use on 
the data consumer’s local machine. The client can download the data in a standard 
format or use it in a workflow. 

Post Condition 

Hydrologic data are downloaded to a data consumer’s local machine in standard 
format(s) for further study or analysis. The user receives the output of the workflow. 

 

 

Table 5 – Use Case 5: Processing 

Overview 

Title Hydrologic Data Processing 

Description Any actor in the system initiating processing of hydrologic 
data/metadata of any of the four types, or any related type of 
processing (e.g semantic mediation). The type of processing ranges 
from transformation operations on individual data sets to data fusion 
merging several data sources; from simple operations to complex 
workflows.  The processing generates aggregate measures or 
derived products. Processing is typically characterized by formally 
defined input and output parameters, including their semantic types. 
Processing functions have metadata sufficient to ensure that 
operations are traceable and transparent so that users have

 Co

confidence in the results. 

Actors  • Hydrologic data consumer 
• Hydrologic catalogue provider 
• Hydrologic data provider 
• Hydrologic processing service provider (note: the Processing 

provider role may be associated with other roles in the system) 
Initial Status 
and 
Preconditions 

Processing services (workflows) have been published online and 
registered in a service registry, which may be integrated into a 
hydrologic data catalog. Processing services have sufficient 
standard metadata to be discoverable. The exposed processing 
capability may be applicable to specific datasets (e.g. when the 
processing service is published along with a data service by data 
provider), or may accept references to datasets available elsewhere 
via published data services. Invoking a processing service may 
require authentication/authorization; it is assumed that the 
processing service user has obtained the necessary authorization.  
It is also assumed that a provider of hydrologic processing service 
has a mechanism for service provisioning at certain level of 
availability (i.e. there are enough resources to support processing, 
and consumers are notified when it is not the case; the resource 
usage and service provisioning are monitored and recorded). 

Basic Flow 
1. A processing service is discovered by a consumer application, and its input and output parameters 

are retrieved from the service description. As part of the same negotiation process, processing 
service provider determines if the consumer is authorized to use the service, and if resources are 
available to satisfy the processing request. 

2. Alternately, a processing service may be coupled with other services as part of a workflow, such as 
data publication, cataloguing, discovery or consumption, and not invoked independently of the 
workflow. For example, data and metadata may require processing before they are delivered to 
data consumer or before they can be indexed by the catalog: in this case processing services may 
appear hidden behind data access or search services. 

3. If multi‐step processing is required, the client application may assemble a chain of services and 
execute them at once, either returning results to the caller after each step, or keeping them at 
the processing service provider (if the provider allows this and has sufficient resources). Such 
application chains may be preserved and appear as single step processing functions. 

Post Condition 

Processing results and status information are returned to the calling client. Information 
about the service use is recorded.

We make a distinction here between provision of processing functionality via services, and 
provision of applications. Hydrologic models run from CUAHSI HydroDesktop plugins, or 
the HydroDesktop application itself, are examples of the latter, and are not included in this 
processing use case. A processing use case is only created when the model becomes wrapped 
as a standard processing service and registered, with all appropriate metadata, in a service 
registry. At the same time, we allow for more than one processing service API – as long as 
the functionality exposed in this way is reusable and can be provisioned on demand. Also, 
the functionality would be normally viewed as stateless from the perspective external to the 
processing service or service workflow. 

A processing function is exposed by a processing service provider, and the function may be 
either coupled with other roles in the system, or be exposed independently. In the latter case, 
it would be registered in a service catalog, and semantically annotated to enable discovery. 
One of the key features of processing functionality compared with data access, discovery, 
and cataloguing functions is that processing requires compute resources which may be 
limited. Hence their use requires recording/monitoring/reporting. In many cases, however, 
this difference between processing and other services (characterized rather as query services) 
is blurred, since queries may require significant resources to execute.  

 

4 Information Viewpoint: Water Information 

4.1 Introduction 

The Information Viewpoint describes the information models of the data and metadata that 
might used when exchanging information over the web.  This is to organize and define the 
information needed to support all of the use cases above (e.g., publication, cataloguing, 
discovery, access, and processing).  This section first provides a description of the high-level 
information model for the different types of hydrologic data that must be supported.  
Following that, we present requirements based on this information model and the use cases in 
Section 3.  Finally, an overview of existing technologies to be considered for encoding 
hydrologic data and metadata for the purposes of this study is presented. 

4.2 Information Model for Hydrologic Data 

The information model defined by this study supports the use cases defined in Section 3 and 
provides the framework for describing hydrologic data and metadata (i.e., characteristics of 
data) required to represent each data value unambiguously. In what follows we distinguish 
between the following three groups: 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

• Hydrologic Data – The complete information needed for unambiguous interpretation 
of hydrologic observations. 

• Discovery metadata – The information needed for data discovery that is the basis for 
the content of a Catalogue. 

• Services metadata – The information needed to describe web services that transmit 
hydrologic data. 

Subsections below address each of these.  Core metadata can be grouped into the following 
categories of content: 

1. Who observed it 
2. What was observed 
3. When was it observed 
4. Where was it observed 
5. How was it observed 
 
All of these categories are needed when providing metadata for the transmission of data 
values, and as such need to be persisted in data storage systems.  However not all this 
information is required for data discovery or as part of the description of data services used to 
access the data.   

Annex A lists the specific attributes that comprise the content of this information model.  
This is grouped into Attribute groups that provide a hierarchical organization of this 
metadata.  There are also columns in Annex A that indicate which attributes are important for 
discovery, and as such are part of discovery metadata, and which attributes are used with 
different classes of hydrologic data and/or are part of services metadata.   

4.2.1 Hydrologic Data 

Hydrologic data are those that describe the water environment or the characteristics of 
weather and climate that affect the water environment.  Observational hydrologic data may 
include measurements of the variable physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the 
water environment or atmosphere and are made to characterize not only natural processes, 
but also the interaction of the hydrologic cycle with the human-built environment and water 
management infrastructure. Observational data can be made in situ (e.g., in the case of a 
continuous stream gauge) or ex situ (e.g., in the case of a water sample that is collected and 
then analyzed in a laboratory) and may be made at a point location or over wide areas of the 
land surface in the case of remotely-sensed data.  Additionally, data with characteristics 
similar to those of hydrologic observations are created as the result of models, simulations, 
and forecasts, and are, in some cases, estimates of variables that cannot be measured directly. 

Based on these characteristics, we define several classes of hydrologic data, irrespective of 
whether the data are from actual observations or arise as a result of a model or simulation:  
(1) time series of water observations at a point; (2) time series of water observations on a 
geographic feature (not limited to point); (3) multidimensional arrays of water observations

OGC 11-013r6 

19

in space and time; and (4) static geospatial datasets that describe the water environment. The 
distinction between types (1) and (2) here is described in Section 4.2.1.2 below. While not all 
of these data classes have been developed within CUAHSI HIS, these would be natural 
extensions from the current capability. 

4.2.1.1 Water Observations at a Point  

Water observation time series are sets of time-indexed values collected at gauges and 
sampling sites.  Such data are collected by many water agencies and also by water and 
atmospheric scientists.  Three main types of observational time series are involved: 

1. Data collected continuously through time using gauges, sensors, or automated samplers 
(e.g., physical hydrology variables, groundwater levels, weather and climate variables, 
or water quality variables); 

2. Data collected intermittently at sampling sites and analyzed later in a laboratory (e.g., 
water quality data samples for surface or groundwater); 

3. Data collected intermittently in the field (e.g., groundwater levels collected 
intermittently at wells, fauna/flora/river behavior description at a given point). 

 

At a high level, the information model for water observation time series is as follows: 

• A data “Source” operates a “Network” containing one or more monitoring “Sites” 
attached to feature(s) from referential datasets (e.g : Mississippi river from point A to 
B bearing the code ‘XYZ’; cf feature model). 

• At each “Site,” a number of “Variables” are measured or estimated over time using 
one or more “Methods,” resulting in “Data Values.” Methods may have sensor 
instance level descriptive metadata, such as calibration, sensor ID, and others.  

• The set of “Data Values” measured or estimated over time at a particular “Site” by a 
particular “Source” for a particular “Variable” using a particular “Method” make up 
an individual “Time Series.” 

• “Time Series” can be copied, processed, and versioned, leading to multiple copies 
with differing “Quality Control Levels.” 

• “Time Series” can be grouped thematically into “Themes,” which define sets of 
“Time Series” that are logically grouped. 

 

4.2.1.2 Time Series of Water Observations on a Geographic Feature  

These are sets of time-indexed values collected over a geographic feature.  Such data are 
similar in many respects to time series at a point, except that the “sampling location(s)” are 
not limited to points, and may differ from the geographic extent of the “domain feature” to 
which they apply.  



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

4.2.1.3 Multidimensional Arrays in Space and Time  

Multidimensional spatiotemporal arrays are generally collected or generated for an 
unchanging spatial domain.  The spatial domain is usually modeled as a regularly-spaced 
grid, with one data value per grid cell at each time. This may be based on a grid of 
latitude/longitude values (for which distance and area measurements between coordinates 
gets smaller moving north), or transformed (projected) to a grid having well defined distance 
and area measures. For example, simulated weather and climate products generally have 
output organized for presentation on a regularly spaced grid. 

At a high level, the information model for multidimensional arrays in space and time is as 
follows: 

• A data “Source” defines one or more “Spatial Domains” for which they have 
assembled data. 

• For each “Spatial Domain,” a number of “Variables” are measured or estimated over 
time using one or more “Methods,” resulting in a regularly spaced grid of “Data 
Values.” 

• The grid of “Data Values” measured or estimated over time for a particular “Spatial 
Domain” by a particular “Source” for a particular “Variable” using a particular 
“Method” make up an individual “Space-time Array.” 

• “Space-time Arrays” can be copied, processed, and versioned, leading to multiple 
copies with differing “Quality Control Levels.” 

• “Space-time Arrays” can be grouped thematically into “Themes,” which define sets 
of “Space-time Arrays” that are logically grouped. 

 

4.2.1.4 Static Geospatial Datasets  

Static geospatial datasets contain data that describe characteristics of or features within a 
particular spatial domain.  The context of the particular spatial domain is usually an 
experimental watershed, data collection area, or region, but can be any spatial domain.  
Examples of static geospatial datasets include watershed boundaries, stream hydrography, 
land cover, soil types, and digital elevation models.  These datasets are static in that they 
either represent features that do not change or change very little over time, or they represent 
snapshots in time (e.g., satellite or aircraft based imagery taken at a particular time).  Static 
geospatial datasets can contain either vector or raster data. 

At a high level, the information model for static geospatial datasets is a follows: 

• A data “Source” defines one or more “Spatial Domains” for which they have 
assembled geospatial data. 

• For each “Spatial Domain,” the “Source” creates one or more “Geospatial Datasets” 
that define one or more “Spatial Fields,” which cover the “Spatial Domain,” or sets of 
“Spatial Features” within the “Spatial Domain.” 

pyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 20
 



OGC 11-013r6 

21

• For each “Spatial Field,” the “Source” defines an attribute that describes the “Spatial 
Domain” (e.g., elevation, land cover), and zero or more “Attributes” for the “Spatial 
Field.” 

• For each set of “Spatial Features,” the “Source” defines an attribute that describes the 
“Spatial Domain” (e.g., elevation, land cover), and one or more “Attributes” for each 
of the “Features.” 

• “Geospatial Datasets” can be copied, processed, and versioned, leading to multiple 
copies with differing “Versions.” 

• “Geospatial Datasets” can be grouped thematically into “Themes,” which define sets 
of “Geospatial Datasets” that are logically grouped. 

 

4.2.2 Discovery Metadata 

Discovery metadata comprises the attributes that should be used when describing data series 
of water observations data indexed in a catalogue that supports identification and preliminary 
screening of data, prior to it being downloaded and used.  The focus is thus on metadata that 
is descriptive of the content of data series (e.g., variables being measured and period of 
record) but not content that while required for unambiguous interpretation does not describe 
the content (e.g., units).   

4.2.3 Hydrologic Data Services  

This Concept Development Study considers the service interfaces and data encodings that are 
appropriate for publishing the four hydrologic data types described above and detailed in 
Annex A.  In addition to the metadata listed in Annex A that describes particular attributes of 
the data, there are also metadata elements that describe a web service that offers one or more 
datasets.  Service-level metadata elements are important in cataloguing the existence and 
contents of data services. 

4.2.4 Semantic Annotations of Hydrologic Metadata 

A major goal of this Concept Development Study is to examine service and data standards 
that will resolve much of the syntactic heterogeneity in data from different sources (e.g., the 
file format, encoding structure, etc.)  However, there is still a high probability of semantic 
differences among the metadata provided by different data publishers within a federated 
system.  Mediating across the vocabularies used by different data publishers to enhance the 
discoverability and integration of data requires the use of semantic technologies, such as 
specialized registries based on RDF (Resource Description Framework).   

Many of the metadata elements described in the sections above, and particularly those that 
are important for data discovery, can potentially be the subjects of one or more controlled 
vocabularies (CVs) that define the set of allowable values for particular metadata elements.  
Rather than using their own terms within their metadata, data publishers choose one of the 
existing terms from a CV to describe their data, thus reducing the number of terms used 
across all sources to those in the agreed upon CV.  CVs can be defined by a community 
process and are an encoding of the vocabulary used within the domain. 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

There are, however, instances where the use of CVs is impractical.  An example of this is a 
large federal data provider like the USGS that has an existing data management system and 
an existing vocabulary that differs from the domain CVs.  In these cases, a mechanism is 
needed to map from the vocabulary used by the data publisher to one that is common with 
other data sources within the domain.  An ontology and semantic mappings between the 
ontology and the domain CVs and any other vocabulary can be used for this purpose. 

4.3 Information Viewpoint Requirements 

The following Information Viewpoint requirements are derived from the high level 
information model described above and from the use cases described in Section 6:

4.4.2 Details 

4.4.2.1 Introduction 

The following sections present detailed information about the storage models and exchange 
encodings presented in Table 7. 

4.4.2.2 Hydrologic Data 

4.4.2.2.1 Encoding(s) of Hydrologic Data for Exchange over the Internet 

The following standard(s) should be considered for encoding hydrologic data for exchange 
over the Internet. 

Title: WaterML: An O&M profile for water observation data 
Version: 2.0 (to be published) 
Description: WaterML 2.0, an O&M profile for water observations data is designed as an 

extensible schema to allow encoding of data to be used in a variety of exchange 
scenarios. Example areas of usage are: exchange of data for operational 
hydrological monitoring programs; supporting operation of infrastructure (e.g., 
dams, supply systems); cross-border exchange of observational data; release of 
data for public dissemination; enhancing disaster management through data 
exchange; and exchange in support of national reporting. 
The core aspect of the model is in the correct, precise description of time series. 
Interpretation of time series relies on understanding the nature of the process that 
generated them. This standard provides the framework with which time series 
can be exchanged with appropriate metadata to allow correct machine 
interpretation and thus correct use for further analysis. Existing systems should 
be able to use this model as a conceptual bridge between existing schemas or 
systems, allowing consistency of the data to be maintained.

Observations and Measurements - XML Implementation (OGC 10-025) 

 

Title: Observations and Measurements - XML Implementation 
Version: 2 
Description: This standard defines an XML implementation of schemas for observations, and 

for features involved in sampling when making observations. This provides 
document models for the exchange of information describing observation acts and 
their results, both within and between different scientific and technical 
communities. The implementation is derived from a conceptual model defined in 
ISO/DIS 19156, and follows the rules for GML Application Schemas described in 
ISO 19136:2007.

Title: Hydrologic Observations Information Model 
Version: 1 

Description: 

The Hydrologic Observations Information Model, defined in Annex A gives the 
fields that should be used when describing hydrologic observations data.  The fields 
can be thought of as fields in a table, where each row defines a single data series.  
The core set of fields is presented in Annex A, derived from ODM (Horsburgh et al., 
2008) and WaterML, but not following either exactly.

Title: Geography Markup Language Simple Features profile 
Version: 2 

Description: 
  
  

The GML standard declares a large number of XML elements and attributes meant to 
support a wide variety of capabilities. For example, the GML standard can encode 
dynamic features, spatial and temporal topology, complex geometric property types 
and coverages. With such a wide scope, interoperability can only be achieved by 
defining profiles of GML that deal with a restricted subset of GML capabilities. Such 
profiles limit the number of GML object types that can appear in compliant schemas 
and consequently are easier to process. 
The generation and parsing of Geographic Markup Language (GML) [OGC 07-036] 
and XML Schema [W3C XML-1, W3C XML-2] code are required in the 
implementation of many components that deal with GML encoded content. The 
Simple Features profile defines a restricted but useful subset of XML-Schema and 
GML to lower the “implementation bar” of time and resources required for an 
organization to commit for developing software that supports GML. It is hoped that 
by lowering the effort required to manipulate XML encoded feature data, 
organizations will be encouraged to invest more time and effort to take greater 
advantage of GML’s rich functionality. 
Development of this profile does not reduce the need for distinct communities of 
users to develop application schemas (data models) for information sharing. 
However, to the extent that users’ application schemas fit within the scope of GML-
SF capabilities, this profile facilitates the ability to use WFS for interoperable feature 
data exchange with much less software development investment.

Description: ISO/TS 19139:2007 defines Geographic MetaData XML (gmd) encoding, an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115. 
 

Title: Sensor Model Language SensorML 

Version: 1.00 

Description: 

The Sensor Model Language Encoding Standard (SensorML) specifies models and 
an XML encoding that provide a framework within which the geometric, dynamic, 
and observational characteristics of sensors and sensor systems can be defined. There 
are many different sensor types, from simple visual thermometers to complex 
electron microscopes and earth observing satellites. These can all be supported 
through the definition of atomic process models and process chains. Within 
SensorML, all processes and components are encoded as application schema of the 
Feature model in the Geographic Markup Language (GML) Version 3.1.1. 
SensorML is one of the elements of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) suite 
of standards.

Description: 

ISO 19119:2005 identifies and defines the architecture patterns for service 
interfaces used for geographic information, defines its relationship to the Open 
Systems Environment model, and presents a geographic services taxonomy and a list 
of example geographic services placed in the services taxonomy. It also prescribes 
how to create a platform-neutral service specification, how to derive conformant 
platform-specific service specifications, and provides guidelines for the selection and 
specification of geographic services from both platform-neutral and platform-specific 
perspectives. 

 

4.4.2.4 Catalogue Information Models 

The following standard(s) should be considered as storage and exchange models for 
catalogues that register hydrologic data and metadata for the purpose of discovery and 
access: 

Title: ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM) 
Version: Version 3.0 

Description: 

An ebXML Registry is an information system that securely manages any content 
type and the standardized metadata that describes it.  The ebXML Registry provides 
a set of services that enable sharing of content and metadata between organizational 
entities in a federated environment. This document defines the types of metadata and

Application Profile of CSW 2.0.2.   

 

Service: Ontology Services (CSW-OWL) 
Version: 0.3.0 
Title: OGC Catalogue Services - OWL Application Profile of CSW 

Description: 

Catalogues based on the CSW standard [OGC 07-006r1] are used to store information 
to manage geospatial resources in an interoperable environment. This information may 
include metadata about resources, including data sets and web services, as well as 
other related information to manage the resources. The existing CSW application 
profiles based on ebRIM [OASIS ebRIM] and ISO 19115/19 [ISO 19115/19] do not 
address the systematic inclusion of semantic information about the resources in 
catalogues beyond the inclusion of basic metadata, so up until now, ad hoc approaches 
have been required in order to include such formalized semantics for geospatial 
resources. 
 
OWL is a language for expressing ontologies that store semantic information about 
concepts using a description logic language that provides opportunities for various 
kinds of reasoning. Furthermore, particular ontologies have been developed to allow 
web services to be semantically described in a way that can support automated 
orchestration in an interoperable environment (for example, OWL-S [W3C OWL-S]). 
 
The inclusion of OWL in a geospatial catalogue has a number of benefits, including 
the representation of richer semantic information to describe resources, to assist 
discovery and to provide opportunities for web services orchestration. The addition of 
the catalogue specification to the usual description logic of ontology standards 
provides for interoperability among semantic resource descriptions within a spatial 
data infrastructure.

5.2.3 Web Services to Consider for the Cataloguing and Discovery Use Cases 

The following standard(s) should be considered to support the Cataloguing and Discovery 
use cases: 

Service: CSW-ebRIM 
Version: 1.0.1 
Title: CSW-ebRIM Registry Service - Part 1: ebRIM profile of CSW 

Description: 

A service-oriented architecture must support some fundamental interactions: 
publishing resource descriptions so that they are accessible to prospective users 
(publish); discovering resources of interest according to some set of search criteria 
(discover); and then interacting with the resource provider to access the desired 
resources (bind). Within such an architecture a registry service plays the essential 
role of matchmaker by providing publication and search functionality, thereby 
enabling a requester to dynamically discover and communicate with a suitable 
resource provider without requiring the requester to have advanced knowledge about 
the provider. 

  

The CSW-ebRIM Registry Service profile is based on the HTTP protocol binding 
(the CSW part) documented in Clause 10 of the OGC Catalogue Services 
Specification (version 2.0.2, OGC 07-006r1). The profile imposes some constraints 
on the use of the base specifications and introduces additional search, retrieval, and 
registry management capabilities. It provides facilities for advertising and 
discovering a wide variety of information resources. While such resources are often 
labeled as “metadata”, it is rarely possible to maintain an absolute distinction since

Title: OpenGIS Web Map Service (WMS) Implementation Specification 

Description: 

The OpenGIS® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) provides a simple 
HTTP interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more 
distributed geospatial databases. A WMS request defines the geographic layer(s) and 
area of interest to be processed. The response to the request is one or more geo-
registered map images (returned as JPEG, PNG, etc.) that can be displayed in a 
browser application. The interface also supports the ability to specify whether the 
returned images should be transparent so that layers from multiple servers can be 
combined or not.

Description: 

The OpenGIS® Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) Profile of the OpenGIS® Web Map 
Service (WMS) Encoding Standard [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms] 
defines an encoding that extends the WMS standard to allow user-defined 
symbolization and coloring of geographic 
feature[http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/f] and 
coverage[http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/c] data. SLD addresses the 
need for users and software to be able to control the visual portrayal of the geospatial 
data. The ability to define styling rules requires a styling language that the client and 
server can both understand. The OpenGIS® Symbology Encoding Standard (SE) 
[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/symbol] provides this language, while the 
SLD profile of WMS enables application of SE to WMS layers using extensions of 
WMS operations. Additionally, SLD defines an operation for standardized access to 
legend symbols.

5.3 Dependencies Analysis 

A large number of OGC services have been presented in these sections that have potentially 
numerous dependencies upon each other and upon other OGC specifications.  Figure 4 
illustrates these dependencies. Understanding these dependencies is important when making 
decisions about the standards and versions to be chosen for implementation.

6 Engineering Viewpoint 

6.1 Introduction 

The engineering viewpoint defines a set of component types that provide the basis for 
deployment in a distributed environment.  Initial consideration for identification of 
Engineering is to consider the components identified in the Enterprise viewpoint.  The 
services and data that are used to define engineering components are defined in the 
informational (Section 4) and computational (Section 5) viewpoints. 

In this clause we present a deployment architecture based on the CUAHSI prototype.  The 
function of each component type is described and some specific topics, such as semantic 
annotation and query, are described in more detail.  At the end of the clause we present a 
variation of the proposed architecture that reduces the number of services that a data 
publisher has to deploy but also provides more flexibility.  It is anticipated that OGC 
prototype activities (pilot or testbed) will exercise both variations in order to compare and 
contrast them. 

6.2 Deployment Architecture for WFS-Based Meta-information Servers 

The UML component diagram (Figure 5) demonstrates the proposed deployment architecture 
for a water information system based on the components identified in the previous 
viewpoints. The components are laid out in a triangle to represent the familiar Publish-Find-
Bind paradigm. Cataloguing components are found at the top of the diagram.  Server 
components, provided by data publishers, are found on the left side of the diagram and client 
components are found on the right side of the diagram. In some cases a component (e.g. Data 
Server) may have one or more sub-components (e.g. Map Server, Coverage Server, etc.).  
Components are connected to each other by lines that represent interfaces that the component 
requires or provides.  Lines with closed-circle terminators represent an interface that the 
connected component provides.   Lines with open, half-circle terminators represent an 
interface that the connected component requires.  At the point where a close-circle terminator 
meets an open half-circle terminator, a label is used to indicate the specific interface required.  
In some cases, the label includes a specific operation from the interface (e.g. 
GetCapabilities).   

The red frame around certain components and interfaces in the lower-left corner represents 
one likely option for insertion of identity management (authentication) and access control 
(authorization) processes and data flows. However, security configurations are beyond the 
scope of the current study and will not be discussed.       

The interactions among these components are detailed in the sections that follow.

6.3.2 Publication and Access  

6.3.2.1 Introduction 

In general, a publisher of hydrologic data and metadata needs to be concerned about access 
control, persistent storage and web services.  This sub-section describes the specific 
components, data models, exchange formats and their relationships as required by a data 
provider in order to publish hydrologic data and metadata onto the web.  

6.3.2.2 Metadata server components 

6.3.2.2.1 Introduction 

The function of the metadata server components is to provide metadata about service 
endpoints and provide metadata about the hydrologic data that a data provider publishes (see 
Use Case 1, Table 1). 

6.3.2.2.2 For Service Endpoints 

Each deployed web service provides metadata about itself in the form of a capabilities 
document (see OGC 06-121r3).  The GetCapabilities operation, which is mandatory for all 
OGC web services, is to be used to obtain the service metadata.   

6.3.2.2.3 For Data Services 

Detailed metadata about the hydrologic time series data (including sampling location(s) at 
which the time series was recorded, or for which it was generated) that a data provider 
publishes shall be made accessible to web clients via the Web Feature Service interface (see 
OGC 09-025r1).  As more widespread GIS support for SOS becomes available, the 
DescribeSensor operation may be used, which provides SensorML encoded metadata. 

pyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 38
 



OGC 11-013r6 

39

The primary query method for the WFS is the GetFeature request.  The canonical response 
encoding for a WFS GetFeature request shall be a GML document that validates against a 
GMLSF (see OGC 10-100r2) application schema that encodes the attributes of the 
Hydrologic Observations Information Model (see Annex A).  In addition SOS 2.0 includes a 
significantly extended GetFeatureOfInterest operation, which might also be considered. 

6.3.2.3 Data Server Components 

6.3.2.3.1 Introduction 

The function of data server components is to provide web access to a data 
providers’provider’s hydrologic data (see Use Case 1, Table 1). 

6.3.2.3.2 For Time Series from a Network of Observation Sites 

Time series of hydrologic data from a network of observation sites can be made accessible to 
web clients via the Sensor Observation Service (see OGC 06-009r6) interface (see Use Case 
4, Table 4). 

The primary query method for the SOS is the GetObservation request.  The canonical 
response encoding for an SOS GetObservation request is an XML document that conforms to 
the WaterML 2.0 standard (see OGC 10-126) which is a profile (see 9.2.2.5.2) of the 
Observations and Measurements standard (see OGC 10-125r1).  

6.3.2.3.3 For Time Series from Grid Cells and other Multidimensional Arrays 

Time series of hydrologic data from grid cells shall be made accessible to web clients via the 
Web Coverage Service (see OGC 09-110r4) interface. 

The primary query method for the WCS is the GetCoverage request.  The canonical response 
for a WCS GetCoverage request shall be a grid coverage encoded in CF-netCDF3 format 
(see OGC 09-018).  As THREDDS implementations also serve GeoTIFF, this would be 
another preferred encoding for responses to WCS GetCoverage requests. 

6.3.2.3.4 For Dynamic and Static Maps 

Data publishers that wish to provide efficient visualization of data to web clients should 
incorporate a Web Map Service (OGC 06-042) interface on top of their hydrologic data, 
metadata, GIS data, and other static map content.  For example a web map server may render 
onto a map the location of the sensors from which water observations are being published 
and overlay that with a hydrographic map. WMS is well suited to styling displays, and 
provides much better performance that WFS or WCS because it only has to move a JPEG, 
PNG or similar graphic image over the network, instead of potentially very large sets of 
geographic coordinates and related data.   

The primary query method for WMS is the GetMap request.  There is no canonical response 
format for a WMS GetMap request as the client and the server negotiate on the response 
image format to use. 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

6.3.2.3.4.1 Static Image Handling 

Web map servers may generate their maps dynamically, by accessing the styling source data 
from a persistent data store, or they may offer static maps in the form of image files.  In the 
latter case, static maps are materialized through the WMS interface as layers where the 
noSubset flag is set to "true" and the fixedWidth and fixedHeight parameters are set to the 
size of the fixed image (see OGC 06-042, 7.2.4.7.1).  This indicates to clients that this 
particular layer is static. 

6.3.2.3.5 For Static GIS Datasets 

A data provider may also offer static GIS data sets, in various formats. These may include 
proprietary vendor-specific formats in order to include data content not currently handled by 
open standards, such as topology, network definitions, and coded-value domains. In such 
cases where no standard encodings or web services are suitable, these datasets can be offered 
for direct download via HTTP or FTP. 

6.3.3 Cataloguing and Discovery 

6.3.3.1 Introduction 

Catalogues are used by data publishers to register their web services and hydrologic data. 
Client software uses the catalogue to find, discover, evaluate and help the end user 
understand services of interests (see Use Cases 2 and 3).  Figure 5 shows two levels of 
catalogues; a main catalogue and a distributed catalogue.  It is anticipated that the 
architecture shall contain only one main catalogue and any number of distributed catalogues 
(e.g., jurisdictional/regional catalogues). 

6.3.3.2 Main Catalogue Component 

The proposed main catalogue component is the CSW-ebRIM Registry Service (07-110r4) 
which is a profile of the HTTP binding defined in the OpenGIS Catalogue Service 
Implementation Specification (07-006r1). The reason for choosing the ebRIM profile of 
CSW is that it has an extensible information model, which enables support for user/client 
queries that filter on fields from the dataset information model, not just the usual metadata 
fields normally catalogued. This is an essential capability for the current project, to enable 
filtering on temporal and hydrologic variable values. This choice of main catalogue 
component may face difficulty in acceptance in Europe due to INSPIRE rules which favor 
CSW 2.0.2 with ISO Metadata Application Profile (OGC 07-045). However, the ISO 
metadata can be supported with CSW-ebRIM, and this situation may evolve with further 
implementation experience. 

The purpose of the main catalogue component is to harvest and cache metadata from the 
distributed catalogues and act as the primary search node for the discovery use case (see 
Table 3).  The main catalogue should support discovery based on locally cached copies of the 
metadata from distributed catalogues and also on distributed search in those cases where the 
distributed catalogue cannot be harvested (see Annex B). This approach is in current use by 
CUAHSI HIS Central with the U.S. national data sources.

OGC 11-013r6 

41

The primary query method for the CSW-ebRIM is the GetRecords request.  The canonical 
response encoding for a CSW-ebRIM GetRecords request is a catalogue record encoded in 
XML that validates against the ebRIM v3.0 schema.  The anticipated query pattern is to first 
search for data using "who-what-where-when" predicates to discover data services of 
interest.  Once the data are discovered, the GetRecords operation can also be used to discover 
which services offer the data of interest and the binding information for those services (see 
Use Case 4, Table 4). However, caching and performance scalability considerations may 
affect this approach, with further implementation experience.  

6.3.3.3 Distributed Catalogue Component 

The proposed distributed catalogue component is the CSW-ebRIM Registry Service (see 
OGC 07-110r4) which is a profile of the HTTP binding in the OpenGIS Catalogue Service 
Implementation Specification (see OGC 07-006r1).   

The purpose of distributed catalogue components is to aggregate metadata about published 
web services by harvesting the capabilities documents of published metadata servers.  The 
content of a distributed catalogue shall include queryables that allow data/metadata and 
service discovery by: data source, experimental site, variable or concept of interest from the 
hydrology ontology, temporal extent, geographic extent, etc.  These queryables are referred 
to as the "who-what-where-when" criteria in Use Case 3. 

The primary harvesting method (the means by which the catalogue is populated with 
metadata) for CSW-ebRIM catalogues is the Harvest request (see OGC 07-110r4, section 
14).  The Harvest request reads well-known metadata, such as the Capabilities document of 
an OGC service, and registers the information into the catalogue.  The Harvest request can 
also be used to periodically refresh this information so that it remains current.  Direct-access 
GIS data can be registered into the catalogue by having the Harvest request read ISO19139 
metadata describing the direct-access data. 

The primary query method for the CSW-ebRIM interface is the GetRecords request.  The 
canonical response encoding for a CSW-ebRIM GetRecords request is an XML document 
that validates against the ebRIM v3.0 schema.  The GetRecords operation can be used to 
search for data using a variety of criteria (i.e., the who-what-where-when queryables from 
Use Case 3) and then find the related service metadata that describes how to access data from 
the discovered service (i.e., bind). This can be done by adding classification schemes to 
support hydrologic searches (e.g., variable types, site types, and Earth realms). 

6.3.3.4 ebRIM Information Model 

ebRIM has been introduced as a profile of CSW in Section 4.4.2.3. The main features of 
ebRIM include: 

1. The ability to register any type of information including all the information types 
used in hydrology. 

2. The ability to create associations between information registered in the catalogue.  
This capability allows, for example, data to be associated with the service that offers 
it so that if either is discovered the other is immediately accessible.   Another example 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

of the use of associations is the ability to organize data into themes; a theme object is 
registered into the catalogue and each data item that is part of the theme is associated 
with the theme object. 

3. The ability to classify and search for information based on a taxonomy or ontology 
that is stored in the catalogue. 

4. The ability to store binding information for services. 

5. The ability to extend the model with domain specific metadata.   

The ebRIM specification defines both a SQL encoding of that model, which can be 
implemented in any SQL-relational database, and an XML encoding for exchange over the 
web. A SQL database is not required to support ebRIM, though it is most often used in 
practice. 

6.3.3.5 OpenSearch Interface 

The CSW-ebRIM API is a full-featured API designed to satisfy the demanding catalogue 
needs of the hydro community.  The CSW standard also provides a simpler, more lightweight 
interface to allow users outside the hydro community to query the available catalogues by 
using OpenSearch (see http://www.opensearch.org). 

OpenSearch is a lightweight query interface designed to support cross-catalogue queries and 
will be a mandatory part of the upcoming CSW 3.0 specification.  Supporting OpenSearch 
from a CSW catalogue does not require any interface changes but does require that the 
catalogue support ATOM (see http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5023/) as a response 
encoding and that the catalogue provide a description document containing templates telling 
OpenSearch clients how to form valid query URLS.  

A significant benefit of OpenSearch is that most available browsers can natively act as 
OpenSearch clients by simply providing an OpenSearch description document.  Most users 
are familiar with the search box in major web browsers that provides a dropdown list of 
search engines that may be used to perform a search; the search engines in that list were 
added to the browser using OpenSearch description documents and the list can be extended 
by simply providing the OpenSearch description document of the search engine to be added.  
So, by supporting OpenSearch, hydro catalogues can now be integrated over the web at large 
and become simply another search engine that can be used to discover resources. 

6.3.3.6 Semantic Annotations and Search 

6.3.3.6.1 Introduction 

As described in Use Case 1, a data provider shall semantically annotate (tag) its metadata 
using controlled vocabularies such as the hydrologic domain ontology.  The purpose of these 
annotations is to support search based on ontology. 

The OGC has done some work on semantic annotation and search but no standards have 
emerged thus far.  This sub-clause presents some approaches that might be explored in a test

http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5023/


OGC 11-013r6 

43

bed to convey semantic annotations from a service to the catalogue and then perform 
semantic searches on the catalogue. 

In order to enable semantic search in a catalogue the following conditions must be satisfied 
by the proposed architecture: 

1. The controlled vocabularies or ontologies that are used for semantic annotation must 
be preloaded into the catalogue which means that the catalogue's information model 
must include the necessary structures to store this information. 

2. The data provider must annotate its information and must make those annotations 
available in a form that a CSW-ebRIM catalogue can harvest. 

3. The catalogue's predicate language must include an operator the supports query based 
on classification schemes or ontologies. 

6.3.3.6.2 Storing Ontology in the Catalogue 

The proposed CSW-ebRIM catalogue component includes a set of structures in its 
information model (see ebRIM, 7.2.6) that provide the ability to store controlled vocabularies 
such as the hydrologic ontology and to tag information stored in the catalogues with those 
annotations.  Figure 6 illustrates the UML model for ebRIM.  The area shaded in blue 
identifies the available model elements for storing ontology and annotating information with 
terms from that ontology.

OGC 11-013r6

6.3.3.6.3 Harvesting Semantic Annotations 

A necessary requirement for supporting semantic search is that the semantic annotations be 
available in some form that a CSW-ebRIM catalogue can harvest.  There is not yet a standard 
way to do this within OGC standards, but this is an area of current investigation (see OWS-8 
discussion in Section 7.4 below). 

One specific approach could be to harvest the semantic annotations using the OGC 
Capabilities document. The OGC Web Services Common Implementation Specification (see 
06-121r9) offers a number of extension points in the capabilities document where such 
annotations can be included.  These extension points include: 

1. Using keywords with a special notation to indicate that specific keywords are in fact 
semantic annotations (see OGC 08-167, clause 3.1.2). 

2. Using the ows:ExtendedCapabilities section to add the necessary XML structures to 
encode the semantic annotations. 

3. Using the available ows:Metadata element to encode or reference the semantic 
annotations.  

4. As part of the data content information of the service. 

 

Example 1: 

The following example (from OGC 08-167, clause 3.1.2) shows how keywords may be used 
to annotate information is OGC web services that use OWS common: 

  ... 
  <ows:Keywords> 
    <ows:Keyword>snow</ows:Keyword> 
    <ows:Type codeSpace=”http://www.cuahsi.com/ontology/hydrophere#”>ontology</ows:Type> 
  </ows:Keywords> 
  ... 
 

Example 2: 

The following example illustrates the use of the standard gml:metaDataProperty element to 
convey semantic annotation in the capabilities document of a service. 

The capabilities document of a Sensor Observation Service (see OGC 06-009r6) includes a 
Content section that contains a list of observation offerings.  The XML encoding of 
observation offerings is derived from gml:AbstractFeatureType which includes an element 
called gml:metaDataProperty that can contain metadata about the offering.  The following 
XML fragment is an example illustrating how the gml:metaDataProperty element can be 
used to convey semantic annotations with an offering: 

pyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 44
 



OGC 11-013r6 

45

<sos:ObservationOffering> 
   <gml:metaDataProperty> 
      <cuahsi:annotation concept="http://www.cuahsi.org/ontology/hydropshere#snow"/> 
   </gml:metaDataProperty> 
   . 
   . 
   . 
</sos:ObservationOffering> 
 

In this example the fictitious cuahsicuahsi:annotation element has been defined to encode the 
concept associated with the observation offering.  In fact any element may be embedded 
within a gml:metaDataProperty element so we could have also reused the ows:Keyword 
element from Example 1. 

In either case, Example 1 or Example 2, a catalogue registering the information would note 
the annotation and tag the incoming information appropriately.   

6.3.3.6.4 ClassifiedAs Operator 

In order to actually be able to query the catalogue using semantic annotations, the CSW must 
include an operator that is capable of traversing the ontology to identify records that have 
been tagged with the desired concepts.  The proposed operator for this purpose is called 
ClassifiedAs (see OGC 08-167).  The proposed prototype for this operation is: classifiedAs( 
concept URI, scope string ) where the valid values for scope are narrow, exact, and full. 

To understand the behavior of the classfiedAs() operator consider the following diagram that 
illustrates a fictitious ontology where the concepts are represented as letters: 

 

 

 

In addition, imagine that the following information has been registered within a CSW-ebRIM 
catalogue: 

 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

Annotation Record Id Record Content 

H 1 … content for record 1 … 

H 2 … content for record 2 … 

I 3 … content for record 3 … 

F 4 … content for record 4 … 

B 5 … content for record 5 … 

C 6 … content for record 6 … 

G 7 … content for record 7 … 

I 8 … content for record 8 … 

H 9 … content for record 9 … 

H 10 … content for record 10 … 

 

The predicate classfiedAs(C,"exact") would match exactly 1 record; record 6 which is tagged 
with concept C. 

The predicate classifiedAs(E,"broad") would match records 1,2,3,8,9,10.  The use of the 
scope "broad" indicates that the operator should match all catalogue records tagged with 
concept E and any child of that concept (H and I in this example). 

The predicate classifiedAs(F,"narrow") would match records 4 and 5.  The use of the scope 
"narrow" indicates that the operator should match all catalogue records annotated with the 
concept F and any ancestor of that concept (B or A in this example). 

6.3.3.6.5 Summary 

In summary, with all the components now defined, the process of harvesting and search 
based on semantic annotations is: 

1. The catalogues are preloaded with the controlled vocabularies and the hydrologic 
ontology. 

2. Publishers annotate their data/metadata and make those annotations available in the 
capabilities documents of their data/metadata servers. 

3. Publishers register their data/metadata servers to the catalogues using the Harvest 
operation. 

pyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium 46
 



OGC 11-013r6 

47

4. The Harvest operation reads the capabilities documents of the data/metadata services 
and registers the services in the catalogue AND tags each piece of information with 
the appropriate annotation based on the information in the capabilities document. 

5. Using the ClassifiedAs() operator users perform queries for records that satisfy 
specified concepts or sets of concepts. 

One objective of an OGC test bed would be to study the possible methods and recommend 
how semantic annotations should be included in an OGC capabilities document. Another 
objective of an OGC test bed would be to exercise the proposed ClassifiedAs() operator and 
determine its suitability in satisfying the use cases. 

6.3.4 Client Component(s) 

6.3.4.1 Introduction  

The client component is the tool end users use to interact with the system. It helps the user 
discover what is available (Use Case 3), and download or use the data of interest (Use Case 
4). The client application interacts with the catalogue and the data provider’s service 
following the interfaces discussed in Section 6.3.2 “Publication and Access.”  

6.3.4.2 Example User – Client Interaction  

Description of a concrete, though hypothetical, application could make the picture and likely 
alternatives more clear: consider a user who is querying for data using a web-based search 
tool. The search tool enables him/her to specify the who-what-where-when criteria, which 
might be displayed as categories (facets) in the search dialog.  The results appear in some 
appropriate place in the browser window, and show the number of results for each category. 
The user continues to filter and query, until the user has found all the data of interest.  There 
is a button for preview of the data that allows the user to get information about the extent and 
possible preview of some values. There might be an "add-to-cart" button beside each result 
which allows that data be added to the download cart.  Once the client is satisfied that they 
have found all the data they require, they go to the download cart and download the data in a 
variety of formats (WaterML, GML, KML, ATOM, etc.). The available formats are 
determined by the output formats that the published services support. 

6.4 Architecture Variations 

6.4.1 Introduction 

The currently proposed deployment architecture (Section 6.2), based on the CUAHSI 
prototype, employs one or more distributed catalogues to act as meta-catalogues of water 
services.  That is, the distributed catalogues do not contain metadata about data services but 
rather hold meta-information for time series inventory WFS servers.  A discovery client 
would query a distributed catalogue to find the set of available time series meta-information 
servers, typically using the OGC core set of queryable properties, and then queries the meta-
information server(s) using WFS requests to examine the time series inventory for specific 
content such as the service provider name or the SOS endpoint that may be accessed to 
obtain data via the GetObservation operation.  The GetObservation operation is then used to 
return WaterML to the client.   



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

We now propose an alternative architecture that leverages already existing interfaces to 
handle discovery of services. This alternative is based on CSW-ebRIM. All metadata 
previously provided by the WFS meta-information server would instead be made available 
via distributed CSW-ebRIM catalogues. 

The CSW-ebRIM specification, like the WFS specification, uses the OGC Filter Encoding 
specification and can thus support the same query types offered by the WFS-based meta-
information servers.  

The CSW-ebRIM would use the GetCapabilities response and other operations to get 
information about data services and populate the catalogue appropriately. For example, it can 
use the GetCapabilities response of SOS to harvest information about the service endpoint.  
The SOS DescribeSensor operation would be used to convey, via SensorML, the metadata 
about a site and process (e.g., site identifier, quality assurance, contact information).  SWE 
common would be used to convey metadata about the data result (e.g., variable names, units).   

The catalogue would be configured to periodically re-harvest all metadata from the source 
services in order to keep the information current.  In fast-changing environments a data 
provider might consider deploying a Sensor Instance Registry Service (see OGC 10-171) 
and/or a Sensor Observable Registry Service (see OGC 09-112) which feed metadata 
changes directly to the catalogue. 

In cases where the data provider has a large set of observations, services or site, the data 
provider may deploy their own CSW-ebRIM catalogue as a distributed node in a network of 
catalogues. 

6.4.2 Deployment Architecture for CSW-Based Meta-information Servers 

The following UML component diagram illustrates the proposed alternative deployment 
architecture for a water information system based on the components identified in the

The services and data types that are used in this alternate deployment architecture are 
summarized in Table 9.  Unlike the previous architecture, which uses a WFS as a meta-
information service providing metadata about service endpoints, sensors, observations, etc., 
in this alternative architecture one or more distributed CSW-ebRIM catalogues assume this 
role.  Also, in the case of time series from sensors it is proposed to leverage other SWE 
standards, such as providing SensorML for site descriptions.

7 Related Work 

There are additional prior and ongoing activities related to this concept report, including 
OGC Interoperability experiments lead by the Hydro Domain Working Group, portions of 
the current OGC Web Services testbed initiative, Phase 8 (OWS-8), and a study being 
developed by CSIRO. 
Over the last several years OGC has run several interoperability experiments in the domain 
of water information systems that have exercised aspects of the deployment architecture 
presented in this report.  The two most relevant previous interoperability experiments are the 
Surface Water Interoperability Experiment and the Ground Water Interoperability 
Experiment.  
 
7.1 Ground Water Interoperability Experiment   

The Ground Water Interoperability Experiment (GWIE) was the first IE to be initiated by 
members of the Hydro DWG, in this case to advance the development of WaterML 2.0.  This 
involved the interaction of several existing representations of water information including 
WaterML (U.S.), Observations & Measurements (O&M from OGC) and GroundWaterML 
(GWML from Canada).  The interoperability experiment tested the use of WaterML 2.0 with 
various services in the OGC stack; namely SOS, WFS, WMS and CSW.  The participants 
and main components of the GWIE are shown in Figure 8; for the final report, see OGC 10-
194r3.

Figure 8 – Ground Water Interoperability Experiment 

 

The architecture of the GWIE was mainly driven by a desire to optimize usability for clients, 
maximize interoperability, and re-use existing infrastructure. Important guiding principles 
include: 

• One web-service access point for clients: this eliminates heterogeneity in service 
delivery that is often present in distributed systems; 

• A single integrated result returned for clients: this reduces the burden on clients in 
integrating responses to queries from multiple clients; 

• Semantic and schematic interoperability: this eliminates the need for schematic and 
semantic translation to be carried out at the server end. 
 

The GWIE adopted a mediated architecture as shown in Figure 8. In this architecture a 
central mediator brokers requests by clients as well as responses by data providers: the 
mediator carries out query distribution, semantic and schematic translation, and response 
integration. It is accessed as a standard OGC WMS, WFS, or SOS. These services also wrap 
spatial databases at the data provider end. A catalogue provides discovery services for: the 
data servers, the mediator services, and potentially for metadata about each sensor (e.g., time 
and value of last reading) to facilitate execution of queries across data providers. 

The final report from the GWIE presents a large number of recommendations and identifies 
(and proposes solutions to) a small number of issues, a sample of which is presented here: 

1. Sensor observation metadata (solution: use CSW) 
2. Relationships between services, e.g., between WMS and WFS and SOS (partial 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

solution: use WMC to encode relationship)  (better solution from Editor: use CSW to 
maintain association) 

3. SOS GetCapabilities and serialization of features-of-interest (solution: allow 
composite/nested features and feature collections in capabilities) 

4. Complex thematic queries in SOS (solution: queries shall be written against SWE 
meta schema rather than a GML XSD schema) 

5. Spatial queries in SOS (solution: use standard identified in filter predicate for the 
geometric property to which the spatial filter is applied) 

6. Handling large volume of results from SOS operations (solution: introduce a 
resultType parameter with "metadata" and "results" values similar to WFS) 

7. Handing large volume of results from SOS operations(solution: introduce 
maxObservations, maxResults, maxFeatures, sortBy and sortOrder parameters in 
SOS) 

8. Handling of units of measure (solution: add ConversionCapabilities section to 
capabilities document; add uom attribute to all comparison operations in FES) 

 

Several change requests to OGC SOS resulted from the GWIE, to better support WaterML 2. 
Many of these were incorporated into SOS 2.0, but some remain to be considered.  See OGC 
10-194r3 GWIE Final Report and the GWIE twiki for more details. 

 
7.2 Surface Water Interoperability Experiment 

The Surface Water Interoperability Experiment (SWIE) began in 2010, and is underway to 
test and refine WaterML 2.0 for encoding surface water data; test the comparability of 
exchanging surface water information encoded using Water ML 2.0 with SOS, WFS and 
WMS services; and advance the near-real-time exchange of surface water data between 
international participants (Germany & France). Figure 9 and the text following presents an 
overview of the experiment.

Figure 9 – Surface Water Interoperability Experiment 

 

In this SWIE architecture WaterML 2.0 and OGC technologies are expected to be used in the 
following manner: 

• WMS is used to display the location of available hydrometric stations on a map 
• WFS is used to provide gauge locations 
• SOS is used to access observations and time series from the hydrometric stations 
• CSW is used to make available observations and time series discoverable  
• A number of technical issues are discussed during the IE including: 
• SOS services that service WaterML 2.0 are used 
• Support for different RDBMS/storage layers is enabled 
• Feature models to use for the IE (the INSPIRE Hydrography Data Model is discussed 

in detail) are defined. 
 

7.3 Water Resources Observation Network Reference Model 

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) 
began development of a Water Resources Observation Network Reference Model (WRON-
RM), a framework for enabling interoperability of various different data sources (O'Hagan, et 
al., 2007). The study was halted before completion, but provides a service-oriented 
architecture with registries to publish and discover data services. The WRON-RM study 
included use of Data Warehouses, a useful and complementary addition to the architecture in 
the current report, as well as proposed operational governance policies and principles that 
should be considered if and when an implementation project can begin.

7.4 OWS-8 Testbed: Cross-Community Interoperability Development  

The OGC Web Services Initiative, Phase 8 (OWS-8) has an activity thread now underway 
called Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI), which is making good progress in designing 
and implementing a web service architecture for semantic mediation across different data 
models having overlapping data content of interest to users. The basic issue is very similar to 
what CUAHSI has to cope with: USGS and Department of Defense (DoD) national-scale 
data overlaps in many areas of the U.S. where DoD may be concerned about anticipating and 
preventing a terrorist attack. The goal of this thread in OWS-8 is to develop an architecture 
based on OGC standards that enables users to query datasets having different semantics, and 
retrieve the correct features from both datasets.  Good progress is being made, and some 
aspects of the work will be directly applicable to the current Water Information System 
Concept Development Study. The results of this work will be made public during or shortly 
after the final demonstration in September 2011. A public description of the initial 
requirements can be found in the Call for Participation here:

8 Interoperability Pilot 

Water resources information is provided and collected by a large, heterogeneous ecosystem 
of individuals and organizations that is complicated even in a small country, becomes even 
more so when viewed from the scale of the United States, and still more complicated from 
the global scale. There seems little possibility that there could ever be a single catalogue for 
all water information in the world, and although CUAHSI maintains the largest water 
observations data catalogue comprising over 23 million time series of integrated information 
from several federal and state agencies and multiple research groups, there are thousands 
more local and state agencies in just the U.S. that are not yet involved. Maintenance and 
scalability issues associated with this catalogue prompted its current focus on federating 
different hydrologic data catalogues, and hence standard information models and web service 
stacks supporting interoperability across catalogues, with efficient interoperation between 
data services and catalogue services. This issue is especially relevant to large public agencies 
in the U.S. whose mandate is to collect and make available large volumes of diverse 
hydrologic data.  
 
The review demonstrated that there are multiple implementation options for hydrologic 
information architecture, which could derive from the OGC services baseline. However, the 
services must work together in a coherent way, structurally and semantically, and conform to 
expectations and requirements of the hydrologic research and modeling community. This 
points to a series of issues that need to be resolved by an OGC interoperability pilot focused 
on a hydrologic data web services software stack. In addition to this study, a Hydrologic Web 
Services Pilot should take into account results of interoperability experiments, conducted 
within the Hydrology Domain Working Group, where similar architectures are being put 
forward. The role of the interoperability pilot will be to provide definitive recommendations 
to the implementers, given the alternative solutions presented in this report.

This concept development report presents a draft architecture for a national-scale Water 
Information System (WaterIS) based on a stack of data, metadata and service standards most 
of which have been developed within the OGC.  Previous, current and future interoperability 
projects within OGC and CUAHSI, just described in Section 7, address many of the issues 
raised here, but further work with federating realistic scales of national and state data is 
needed to make sure the options and recommendations presented here are the right ones. 
Scalability and performance are key measures we need to test.  

The main goal of an implementation pilot project based on this concept report should be to 
exercise and stress-test the two alternative system architecture patterns described here, taking 
into account emerging standards and practices where possible.  Broadly, these were the 
WFS-based metadata server approach, and the CSW-ebRIM approach for metadata server.  

Presented here are some specific aspects of the deployment architecture(s) to be investigated 
in a pilot.  They are presented under the broad headings of Publish-Find-Bind, followed by a 
discussion of managing complexity. 

Publish (i.e., data provider deploys services which are harvested by catalogues for 
discovery): 

• Advance the use of SensorML to represent metadata of sites, sensors and observed 
data based on the Hydrologic Observations Information Model (map Annex A to 
SensorML). This has already been started in the SensorML profile for discovery. This 
could be extended to a Hydrology Profile of SensorML. (Currently especially the 
European FP7 projects GENESIS and EO2HEAVEN are addressing the question of a 
SensorML profile for discovery purposes.) 

• Create a mapping of SensorML to ebRIM in order to support the discovery of sensors 
and time series data through CSW ebRIM. This would be the second step after a 
SensorML Hydrology Profile has been created. There are already ebRIM Catalogue 
implementations available that support the latest version of the SensorML profile for 
discovery. 

• Even though not discussed in this report, future investigation can be performed on the 
use of ISO 19115 Part 2, which provides a metadata model that can be used to 
describe hydrologic networks, sites and time series.  

• Advance the use of the methodologies and procedures for mapping data provider 
concepts with ontologies in the CSW.  

• Advance the mapping of WQX to SOS/WaterML 2.0. 
• Advance open source tools (e.g., GeoNetwork) to provide the CSW-ebRIM.  
• Advance the use of CSW-ebRIM to harvest SOS service. This can replace the WFS 

metadata service to have a consistent interface to query metadata in a distributed 
hierarchical (system of systems) environment. This requires the creation of harvesting 
methods that utilize the SOS discovery methods (GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, 
etc.).  To support near-real-time updates of the catalogue, this investigation may also 
involve looking at the SIR/SOR services. 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

 

Find (i.e., query a catalogue to discover services that provide data of interest): 

• Incorporate in the ebRIM model the classes required to provide faceted searches. 
• Test distributed discovery using federated query of catalogues using the who-what-

when-where pattern of Use Case 3.  
 

Bind (i.e., access services that provide data of interest to download the data): 

• Explore the use of open search based on the CSW-ebRIM model. 
• Advance tools to visualize metadata records in a GUI. 
• Develop a web based Water Information System portal that allows client to discover 

services that offer hydrologic data of interest to them and then bind to those services 
to download the desired data. 
 

Pilot sponsors may include agencies, research institutions, and companies that want to 
advance interoperability among their systems and the whole hydrologic community. Ideas for 
the pilot also include implementation at the sponsor’s organization of the components 
described in the report, for example setting an SOS that provides data encoded in WaterML 
2.0. 

Mitigating Complexity: Semantics and Complex Information Models 

As the study demonstrated, as long as the information models of the various data sources 
being combined are reasonably consistent, there may be more than one service interface for 
hydrologic information system components. For example, time series catalogues may have 
both WFS and CSW-ebRIM endpoints, and implementing organizations should be able to 
choose which technology is more compatible with their publication mandates and internal 
procedures – as long as the service interfaces are formally defined and documented, and 
express information models that hydrologists can interpret. 

It is important that patterns of hydrologic information infrastructure conform to how the 
hydrologic research community is organized. There are large and small data providers, which 
may choose to implement different components from the hydrologic services stack. For 
example, larger data publishers may implement CSW-ebRIM catalogues supporting 
semantics-based discovery and harvesting, which would index multiple data services within 
the organization.  Smaller data publishers (typically, academic projects) may limit the 
software stack to data services and have them catalogued by community organizations such 
as CUAHSI. The interoperability pilot would address interoperation between hydrologic 
information nodes of different complexity. The approximate “implementation complexity” 
progression is shown in the figure below.

Figure 10 – Implementation Complexity 

To be interoperable, services should support semantically consistent binding patterns. For 
example, the key notions of “feature”, “dataset”, etc. should have consistent semantics 
throughout the services stack. Currently, even within a single service this meaning may vary 
between requests (e.g., as demonstrated in HDWG Interoperability Experiments, which 
showed that the semantics of “feature” may be different in common usage in SOS). One of 
the tasks of an implementation pilot would be to address such inconsistencies within and 
between services in the hydrologic services stack. 

 

9 Summary and Conclusions 

This Concept Development Study was conducted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) 
Interoperability Program at the request of the Consortium of Universities for the 
Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI), with the goal of helping CUAHSI to 
understand how to best utilize and adapt standard encodings and web services developed by 
OGC to convey water resources data through the Internet.   

This Concept Development Study has produced a framework for considering and testing 
relevant, alternative approaches. It has not arrived at complete, definitive solutions for all 
these questions.  Further investigation in the various OGC programs is needed.

This report provides a snapshot of service standards and practices available and in use 
“now”. As standards evolve and implementations mature, other implementation options 
should be considered. For example, our rendition of time series catalogue services is to a 
large extent influenced by wide availability of WFS implementations to relay GML Simple 
Features. These implementations are easy to use and incorporate in existing agency or 
research group workflows, thus providing a timely – though perhaps not perfect – solution 
for the key use cases put forward in this document. As service standards are evolving to 
handle more and better data collections, we envision that the framework created by this 
report will be continuously updated.

Annex A 
 

Attributes of the Hydrologic Observations Information Model 

This annex lists the attributes deemed required for unambiguous representation of the 
hydrologic data addressed in this study.  This is derived and adapted from sources such as 
ODM and WaterML, drawing upon our experience working with these systems, but does not 
follow any one of these exactly.  Rather the focus is on the content deemed most suitable for 
representation of hydrologic information to support the use cases of this study. 

Attribute Name and Description describe the actual attributes.  Attribute Group organizes 
these by what, where, when, who, how and by data value, dataset, web service and theme.  
The “Important for Discovery” column indicates the subset of attributes that comprise the 
authors’ assessment of the subset most useful for discovery and thus the basis for the 
catalogue content.  We recognize that this is a judgment or design trade off.  Holding more 
data in a catalogue can support more extensive search, at the expense of greater complexity.  
There are five scope columns on the right that indicate the scope of each attribute as follows: 

• PTS – Point time series 
• FTS – Feature time series 
• MA – Multidimensional array 
• S – Static 
• DS – Data Services

Annex B 
Trade Study: Distributed Search vs. Harvest 

B.1 Introduction 

The main catalogue has two ways to interact with distributed catalogues: Harvest and 
Distributed Search.  This clause discusses both of the alternatives.  After defining the 
alternatives, a set of evaluation criteria is defined followed by an analysis of the alternatives 
using the criteria.  Conclusions are presented at the end. 

B.2 Trade Study Alternatives 

The Harvest alternative retrieves metadata from Distributed Catalogues, often on a regular 
basis, and stores the retrieved metadata in the Main Catalogue cache.  This alternative creates 
a copy of the Distributed Catalogue metadata in the Clearinghouse. Advantages of this 
approach are that searches of the Main Catalogue are completed quicker because the data is 
local and offers a fall back solution if the Distributed Catalogue is not online. Disadvantages 
include that the Main Catalogue copy of the metadata may be out of date and the required 
effort to initially harvested the metadata from the Distributed Catalogues. 

The Distributed Search alternative is invoked when the Main Catalogue receives a search 
request from a client and propagates a secondary request to one or more Distributed 
Catalogues.  An advantage of this approach is that the metadata is maintained and managed 
closer to the data provider.  A disadvantage is that distributed searching takes longer to 
complete and has more chances for the search to not be completed. 

B.3 Trade Study Evaluation Criteria 

The following criteria are used to evaluate the options. 

User response time: 
The performance in terms of time to respond to a user search placed against the Main 
Catalogue.  The User’s search is assumed to trigger distributed searching.  The duration is 
from the time the search is received by the Main Catalogue until the operation has fully 
completed and the Main Catalogue has replied to the user with results. 

Results ranking: 
Users desire that the results of a search be ranked in a fashion that provides the result of most 
interest at the top of the list.  Ranking of results requires that the entire result set can be 
evaluated in a uniform fashion. 

Metadata accuracy: 
The consistency of the metadata received by the user in comparison to the most accurate 
metadata available at any location at the time of the search. 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

Metadata ownership: 
Compatibility of the alternative to stewardship of metadata by the organization that is 
charged with maintaining the metadata. 

Robustness 
Ability of alternative to gracefully handle unanticipated changes of the distributed 
catalogues, e.g., catalogue off-line, catalogue schema changed. 

Adaptive Modularity: 
Ability to accommodate the addition and deletions of Distributed Catalogues from the 
architecture. 

Clearinghouse Cost: 
Cost for creating and maintaining the Main Catalogue – not including the costs of the 
Distributed Catalogues. 

 

B.4 Trade Study Assessment Matrix 

The following matrix presents the analysis of the Alternatives using the evaluation criteria 
defined in the previous clause.

 Alternative 1:  
Distributed Search 

Alternative 2:  
Harvesting 

1. User response time Comparatively Worse 
Distributed searches require 
network and searches not 
required by harvest option. 

Comparatively Better 
All searches are satisfied locally. 

 

2. Results Ranking Comparatively Worse 
Sorting of results from 
distributed catalogues can only 
be accomplished after all queries 
complete and are processed at 
the Clearinghouse. 

Comparatively Better 
Sorting of a result set from the local 
cache is quick and accurate. 

3. Metadata accuracy Comparatively Better 
Metadata is retrieved from 
closer to the maintaining 
organization at the time of the 
user’s search. 

Comparatively Worse 
Metadata may be changed by the 
maintaining organization after the 
harvest. 

4. Metadata 
ownership 

Comparatively Better 
Metadata remains on the servers 
owned by the organization the 
metadata. 

Comparatively Worse 
Bulk copy of metadata from a 
community catalogue may not be 
permitted by the maintaining 
organization.  

5. Robustness Comparatively Worse 
Changes are detected at time of 
search with limited response 
options. 

Comparatively Better 
Addition of a new resource is 
accomplished offline from user queries. 

6. Adaptive 
Modularity 

Comparatively Equivalent Comparatively Equivalent 

7. Clearinghouse 
Cost 

Comparatively Better 
Minimizes resources required at 
single Clearinghouse node. 

Comparatively Worse 
Higher costs for Clearinghouse to 
maintain a larger store of metadata. 

 

 

B.5 Trade Study Conclusions 

The consensus is that the most important criteria are: 1) User Response Time and 2) Results 
Ranking.  Therefore, the Harvest option should be selected for as many Distributed 
Catalogues as possible. 

Given the nature of WIS’s, i.e., a system of systems, there will be catalogues that cannot or 
will not be harvested.  Where a Distributed Catalogue distinguishes between collection and 
granule metadata, only the collection metadata should be harvested. Some catalogues will 
object to being harvested, i.e., criteria 4) Metadata ownership.  Therefore, the Main 
Catalogue should provide a distributed search functionality but its use should be minimized. 



OGC 11-013r6 

 Co

To meet this hybrid recommendation, further analysis of the Main Catalogue server interface 
is required.  Currently there is not a widely implemented catalogue interface standard that 
blends a full response from the local harvested cache with stateful distributed queries.  What 
is needed is a stateless catalogue interface for hybrid search: immediate response to user 
while distributed searches are continuing.

Annex C 
Trade Study: Serving Metadata via WFS/CSW vs. CSW/CSW 

C.1  Introduction 

The current CUAHSI HIS system provides a meta-catalogue of water services. The meta-
catalogue follows a CSW Dublin Core profile. The records in the CSW reference WFS 
services. The WFS services allow to query specifics about the time series (e.g., service via 
provider name, site name, variables, time frame), using OGC Filter Encoding (FE). WFS 
services point to SOS services which allow access to data via GetObservation. The 
GetObservation result returns O&M with WaterML 2.0 encoding.  

This approach can be contrasted to only having an SOS as a data service endpoint for data, 
and a rich CSW-ebRIM for metadata cataloguing of data services which provides time series 
description details. The CSW-ebRIM can replace the functionality currently being provided 
by WFS/FE.  

C.2  Trade Study Alternatives 

Two alternatives are envisioned: 

1) Provide a meta-catalogue CSW that contains records that describe WFS services that 
provide descriptions of time series metadata. 

2) Provide CSW as the main metadata interface. Still data providers can provide a 
metadata catalogue of time series, but via CSW instead of the WFS. The catalogue 
metadata model may need to use an ebRIM model, following the time series meta 
model that the WFS is based on (Annex A).  

C. 3 Trade Study Evaluation Criteria 

The evaluation criteria of this trade study are shown below. The value of the criteria varies 
from 1 to 5, where 5 is the most important. The ease of implementation is the most important 
criteria with a value of 5. 

Criteria Description Value 
(1-5) 

Consistency accessing metadata 

 

Ability to provide a common interface when accessing 
metadata. Includes metadata at different levels. For 
example for catalogues, for services, for data sets, for time 
series. 

2 

Querying/filtering of metadata 
on data provider service 

Ability to query any metadata elements in the metadata 
server.

C.4  Trade Study Assessment Matrix 

The table presents an analysis of using WFS and CSW vs. CSW only to provide metadata 
access and discovery. Approach 2 shows the CSW only approach and presents SOS as one 
possible service that can be registered at the CSW. Other registered services will follow the 
same pattern as in the case of SOS. 

 Approach 1 (WFS/CSW) Approach 2 (SOS/CSW) 
1. Consistency when 
accessing metadata 

Comparatively Worse 
 
Not consistent. Metadata about the time 
series (sites and observations) is 
accessed via WFS, but metadata about 
services is accessed via CSW. Current 
WFS service is tightly coupled to time 
series and currently supports a simple 
feature profile. Difficult to support 
more complex metadata models. 

Comparatively Better 
 
Consistent. CSW can be used 
consistently at different levels 
(meta level, regional and data 
provider level) to search, 
discover and evaluate the 
different types of services. 

2. Querying/filtering of 
metadata on data provider 
service 

Comparatively Equivalent 
 
WFS via Filter Encoding (FE) can 
provide excellent support to filter the 
metadata of a data provider server. 

Comparatively Equivalent 
 
CSW has the same support as 
WFS for FE. 
 

3. Ease of implementation Comparatively Better 
 
WFS is more mature than CSW-
ebRIM, so more tools exist to deploy 
WFS servers. WFS is also much 
simpler than CSW-ebRIM. CUAHSI 
already has tools that support the WFS 
providing the metadata for time series 
services. However, the available tools 
support simple features which limits 
the expressiveness of more complex 
models.  
Another factor is that this usage of 
WFS is not fully consistent with 
established practice. That is not to say 
it should not be done, but it’s not the 
usual design pattern web developers 
would expect. Opinions vary on the 
importance of this (some developers 
are more resistant to this approach than 
others).  

Comparatively Worse 
 
Even though CSW-ebRIM is a 
standard, few implementations 
and supporting tools exist. For 
example GeoNetwork, the best 
open source tool for catalogues 
available, only has an 
experimental ebRIM, whose 
code is not yet in a stable 
release.  
 
However, the GENESIS project 
in Europe has already 
implemented this approach. It 
relies on SOS instances 
providing SensorML encoded 
metadata, the SIR for converting 
these metadata to ebRIM, and 
CSW/ebRIM for making these 
data sets searchable.  One 
Catalogue that is supported is the 
Buddata ebXML registry, and 
ERDAS has worked on this as 
well (and are editor of the 
related OGC Discussion Paper) 

 



OGC 11-013r6 

73

 Approach 1 (WFS/CSW) Approach 2 (SOS/CSW) 

4. Support of semantic 
search 

Comparatively Worse 
WFS servers do not support search on 
higher concepts. This is currently done 
via keywords in the metadata model. 
(See Ontology Concept in Annex A.) 

Comparatively Better 
CSW-ebRIM allows search on 
higher concepts that are bound to 
services registered. The higher 
concepts can be conceptualized 
in a model, which can provide 
support for faceted searching, 
instead of relying only a 
“keyword” field. 

 
 

C.5 Trade Study Conclusions 

The summary of the preceding comparisons is shown below. A maximum value for each 
criterion, defined in C.3, was given to the approach that was better or equivalent. The value 
given to the “worse” option for each criterion was a matter of judgment by the report authors. 
These rankings could change over the coming months as well, depending on standards up-
take and further implementation experience. Given that these rankings are somewhat 
subjective, the two approaches seem fairly well matched at present. This is the reason that the 
report is presenting both architectures.

Annex D 
Data and Metadata Storage Recommendations 

D.1 Persistent Data Store Component 

D.1.2 Purpose 

The function of the persistent data store is to store and manage hydrologic data and metadata 
as stated in Use Case 1 (see Table 1).  Since the persistent data store is opaque to clients 
accessing the data from the web there is considerable latitude in how this component is 
implemented.  Requirements for the persistent data store will likely be driven by the specific 
web service interface components chosen to deploy the data onto the web. 

D.1.3 Content and Encoding 

In some hydrologic information systems, the persistent data store for time series water 
observations and related metadata is done by using the Observations Data Model. Although it 
is represented by a single box in Figure 5, persistent storage and management of hydrologic 
data and metadata may be distributed across multiple data stores.   

The persistent data store may be driven by temporal restrictions on the data or limitations of 
the procedure collecting the data.  For example, data streaming from a sensor may only be 
persistently maintained for 24 hours, due to the sensor’s limited storage capacity. 

D.1.4 Interface 

The component diagram in Figure 5 shows the interface between the persistent data store and 
the web services as being SQL.  This is only an example based on the fact that most modern 
persistent data stores are implemented using SQL relational databases. Again the persistent 
store is opaque to the web and so implementers are free to choose whichever interfaces make 
sense for their deployment.
