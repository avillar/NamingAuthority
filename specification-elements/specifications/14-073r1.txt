Preface 

The FAA’s Aircraft Access to System Wide Information Management (AAtS) initiative 
is in its evolutionary stages of requirements and standards development. Its goal is to 
provide aircraft connectivity to the FAA’s SWIM infrastructure to communicate/share 
aviation data and services. This connectivity will establish a common operating picture 
between the flight deck and air traffic control for collaborative strategic decision-making.  
Distribution of the vast amount of operational information (such as AI, MET and ATM) 
needed to support the safe movement of aircraft during all phases of flight in the National 
Airspace System (NAS) will increase capacity, efficiency, and result in more timely 
departures and arrivals.  

Similarly, there are a number of aviation standards in development by a variety of 
industry groups and committees (i.e., the RTCA Special Committee 206 (SC-206), 
ARINC 830 Aircraft/Ground Information Exchange (AGIE), and Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) standards) that are also pursuing the development of requirements 
and standards that can extend ground-based aviation-related information and data 
networking technology to support the operation of aircraft as well. 

With these efforts, the FAA and industry are moving towards consensus that electronic 
distribution of operational data and technical information will increase NAS/airline 
productivity and efficiency as well as deliver a more positive passenger experience both 
domestically and internationally. There is an additional need to encourage coordination 
and harmonization of these efforts worldwide since the aforementioned aviation 
committees also represent global interests.  

The AAtS Harmonization project has developed and executed a plan whereby overlaps 
and conflicts in scope and functionality of SC-206, AGIE and OGC standards have been 
identified and harmonized for both domestic and international utilization. The goal has 
been to develop and document an updated AAtS architecture that harmoniously 
incorporates value and functionality from all three and supports aviation operations that 
are global in scope.

Executive Summary 

Background 

The FAA’s Systems Engineering, NAS Architecture organization has been sponsoring an 
effort to harmonize aviation-related industry standards with the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) as the lead. The effort has been organized with a small core team of 
experts responsible for developing strategy and products, and a larger industry-wide 
“Tiger” team providing inputs, cross-industry perspectives and expertise in industry 
standards efforts. The core team included members from: FAA AAtS, OGC, Boeing, 
Panasonic, and North Star. Other key members of the AAtS Harmonization Tiger team 
are listed in Annex A. 

Approach and Methodology 

This report focuses on the harmonization of AAtS as described in FAA IGD v.3.0 with 
RTCA SC-206 (architecture and requirements), ARINC 830 Air Ground Information 
Exchange (AGIE) and OGC standards. Harmonization tasks included: 

1. Analyzing and shaping existing as well as emerging standards; 
2. Developing a harmonized architecture that addresses the functional requirements; 

and  
3. Formulating conclusions and recommendations to: 

a. address identified harmonization issues 
b. support decision processes of policy makers, government, and industry 

Architecture 

This report documents:  

 a harmonized architecture based upon concepts and standards from FAA AAtS, 
RTCA SC-206, ARINC 830 (AGIE) and OGC 

 a new, recommended, high-level system architecture that both updates and 
expands the scope of the harmonized architecture 

Harmonized Architecture 

The harmonized architecture defines the role and scope of each standards package 
relative to the other packages in the context of a generalized network computing protocol 
stack. The standards generally fall into two categories. AAtS and SC-206 standards cover 
both application and services - middleware functions (and corresponding requirements). 
In an AAtS context, AGIE and OGC standards mainly cover re-usable services - 
middleware functions that multiple end-user applications can leverage to reduce cost, 
improve integration, and lower development effort, as well as increase operational 
efficiency and interoperability. AGIE standards can also cover some application 
functions in the context of non-AAtS applications and information exchanges. 



OGC 14-073r1

The harmonized architecture identifies areas of standards overlap and gaps with regard to 
intended use, end-user applications needs, and key business requirements. It utilizes a 
layered design pattern to show how different application, services, and middleware 
functions interface and interact, as well as where related, critical but out-of-scope 
functions fit. The architecture is characterized through a system level view in which 
functional components are distributed in nominal topologies between the information 
providers and consumers. The system level view identifies key functional features that 
are common across the standards and shows where they might be allocated to provide an 
efficient and harmonized AAtS implementation. 

High-level System Architecture 

The high-level system architecture described and recommended in this report expands the 
scope of the harmonized architecture to include other relevant industry and aviation 
standards as well as other air-ground architectures. The recommended architecture is 
developed by expanding from the standalone FAA/NAS AAtS architecture to incorporate 
a perspective based on industry standards-based solutions as well as a global perspective. 
It provides a basis for initial global interoperability discussions. 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

As documented in this report, the goal of the AAtS harmonization project to “harmonize 
standards and concepts within the AAtS trade space” was accomplished through 
coordination amongst multiple standards team members and other activities. The 
following conclusions were reached and recommendations developed: 

Conclusions 

1. A harmonized architecture based on AAtS with SC-206, AGIE and OGC 
standards is achievable and provides a framework for deploying AAtS as a multi-
domain solution. 

2. Harmonization across these three standards in the AAtS architecture allows the 
benefits of the capabilities from each standard to be realized in a consistent 
implementation. 

3. The AAtS architecture as defined in IGD v3.0 is too constraining to fully reflect 
the capabilities and benefits of the harmonized architecture. 

Recommendations 

1. Recommend incorporation into future updates of the AAtS IGD of an enhanced 
and broader architecture and environment based on the harmonization team 
review comments and recommendations. 

2. Recommend the development and testing of a harmonized solution (prototype). 
3. Recommend follow-on harmonization efforts to include other key industry 

standards.

OGC® Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) Harmonization 
Architecture Report 

1 Introduction 

1.1 Scope 

This OGC® document describes the Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) harmonization 
architecture developed by a team funded by the FAA and led by the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC). The architecture harmonizes: 

 [AAtS] Aircraft Access to SWIM concepts; 
 [SC-206] RTCA aeronautical information services (AIS) and meteorological 

(MET) information data link service committee concepts and standards; 
 [AGIE] Air-Ground Information Exchange A830 standards; and  
 [OGC] OGC encoding and services standards as well as architectural 

perspectives.  

It identifies areas harmonized in common for all four standards packages, areas 
harmonized across two or three standards and unique areas of each standard that either 
require further harmonization or impede full harmonization. 

1.2 Purpose & Objective 

The purpose of the harmonization effort has been to leverage the strengths of distinct but 
related standardization efforts in order to improve the scope, scale, and interoperability of 
aircraft-ground data communications under the auspices of the FAA AAtS concept and 
program. 

The objectives of this report are to: 

 Describe the challenge of harmonizing disparate standards and a layered 
architecture methodology for addressing it. 

 Apply the harmonization methodology to three principal standards or standards 
packages relevant to AAtS (SC-206, AGIE, OGC) 

 Recommend a new high-level AAtS system architecture incorporating SC-206, 
AGIE, OGC, and other standards.

4 Architecture Overview 

This chapter provides an overview of the approach taken towards a harmonized AAtS 
architecture. 

4.1 Harmonization Problem 

AAtS, SC-206, AGIE and OGC standards, architecture, use cases and business value 
propositions have mostly been independently developed. Overlaps have not been 
identified and they have not been designed to work together in concert. The AAtS 
harmonization effort is intended to identify and recommend fixes to harmonization issues 
between these standards. One aspect of AAtS harmonization is ensuring the standards can 
work together in one or more common architectures. 

The primary goal is to define a harmonized architecture that describes an AAtS 
implementation environment which leverages capabilities from each of the relevant 
standards as applicable. The architecture must depict the value discovered by the 
harmonization effort for common and unique areas that accentuate the value of each 
specific standard. This includes key application capabilities, infrastructure services and 
functions of AAtS, SC-206, AGIE, and OGC. 

A key tool in the development of harmonized architectures is the use of system layers or 
levels with well-defined interfaces between them that serve to separate concerns and 
technology choices in one layer from those in another. At an application level there are 
AAtS and SC-206 harmonized functions along with gaps and differences in functionality 
or requirements. At the service level there are AAtS and SC-206 lower-level functions 
harmonized with AGIE and OGC infrastructure services. 

The major issues in harmonizing the application level of AAtS with SC-206 within the 
prototype context are: 

1. The harmonization scope limits SC-206 use cases. It only covers IP data link 
capable uses (no air-air and broadcast services). 

2. AAtS does not show non-SWIM ground sources in its architecture. 
3. AAtS focuses on non-safety critical (i.e. category 2) use cases. 

The major issues with harmonizing the service level of AAtS and SC-206 functions with 
AGIE and OGC standards are:  

1. AAtS-type (combined AAtS and SC-206) use cases and architectures do not 
account for implementation in a larger aviation environment, e.g. cabin, 
maintenance, non-AAtS flight operations. 

2. AAtS and SC-206 are written and viewed from regulatory and flight deck 
perspectives whereas AGIE and OGC are written and viewed from commercial 
and multi-domain perspectives. 



OGC 14-073r1

These standards each have separate application space, intended uses, and technical 
architectures. The first task is to define what these are and how they relate to each other. 
See Figure 1 below. The second task is to focus on the architecture aspects useful to 
harmonization.  

  

 

Figure 1 - Venn diagram of the applicable standards space 

Figure 1 describes the coverage of each standard within a space defined by application 
functionality vs intended use in order to illustrate overlaps and gaps between them. The 
following describe key areas of overlap in the diagram. 

Applications 

There are five areas in Figure 1 that relate to application capabilities and features of the 
standards that the team identified as necessary to harmonize. In this case “applications” 
refers to unique functions, capabilities, requirements and unique non-re-usable services. 
That is special software required to meet the unique end user application demands. Both 
AGIE and OGC provide services and non-AAtS infrastructure functionality to support a 
larger scope than that defined by AAtS. 

1. AAtS unique – this area contains all the unique AAtS functions and requirements. 
This includes flight information (in addition to SC-206 AIS and MET) functions, 
data and requirements. 



OGC 14-073r1

2. SC-206 unique – this area contains all the unique SC-206 functions and 
requirements. It includes any safety critical applications and requirements, and 
non-networks (IP-like) communications (such as air-air, broadcast). 

3. Non-AAtS AGIE supported – this area contains all the AGIE supported 
applications that are non-AAtS. This includes cabin, maintenance, software 
delivery, passenger entertainment, and other such applications.  

4. Non-AAtS OGC supported – this area contains all the OGC supported 
applications that are non-AAtS, for example built environment, defense & 
intelligence, emergency response & disaster management.  

5. AAtS & SC-206 common – this area contains all the common AAtS and SC-206 
functions and requirements, for example regarding AIS and MET information. 

Services and Middleware 

Four service or middleware areas are considered key areas. In this case, services or 
middleware refers to functionality that supports the end user applications and is generally 
either a software level “service” or “re-usable middleware software”.  

6. AAtS AGIE services – this area contains all the AGIE-only supported services 
and middleware functions. 

7. AAtS OGC services – this area contains all the OGC-only supported services and 
middleware functions that support AAtS and SC206 that are not AGIE. 

8. AGIE OGC services – this area is about the realization of communications and 
services with AGIE and OGC protocols in general, without specific relevance to 
either AAtS or SC-206. 

9. AAtS, SC-206, AGIE & OGC common services – this area contains all the 
services and functions that both AGIE and OGC support for AAtS and SC-206. 

The AGIE standard focuses on Internet Protocol (IP) transport and network capabilities. 
In principle, OGC standards are transport protocol agnostic; however, they are typically 
bound to IP-based protocols. 

While AAtS has not yet specified a transport mechanism, there appears to be a consensus 
that it will rely on IP at some point in the future. SC-206 as currently represented also 
supports aviation-based, non-IP transport mechanisms and data links including VHF, HF, 
ADS-B and non-IP satellite communication links. Many of these data links bear no 
resemblance to modern day ground-based networking and are more like legacy radio 
communication links leveraging true broadcast where the sender broadcasts a message 
blindly and any suitably equipped destination may receive it.  

4.2 In the Large 

Both AGIE and OGC are defined as industry standards. OGC standards in particular 
specify information and service models that are used across multiple industry domains. 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 9 
 

AAtS utilizing OGC standards may therefore be able to leverage infrastructure services 
that are not aviation-specific but still re-usable for aviation purposes, reducing 
infrastructure service costs. AGIE is an aviation-specific standard but one designed to 
support a range of aviation domains, of which AAtS applications are only a small part. 
AGIE supports traffic management for essentially all onboard data communications 
applications. This is important because the requirements and scope for each onboard 
application (including those in both SC-206 and AAtS) are defined only for its specific 
standalone functionality. Each independent application on each airplane competes for 
scarce and costly air-ground bandwidth from airline networks or even from networks that 
support both aviation and non-aviation users (e.g., Inmarsat, Iridium, etc.). This is 
especially true for Internet Protocol (IP) systems because IP has been configured to 
function globally using only “greedy” bandwidth management algorithms. AGIE’s and 
OGC’s cross-domain holistic perspectives are unique in the aviation industry. Both 
support solutions that address the need for communication and services “in the large” – 
see Figure 2 and Figure 3.

Figure 3 – OGC example of “In the Large” Context 

Today’s air-ground environment, as characterized in both AAtS and SC-206, consists of 
many stove-piped applications or application suites which compete with each other for 
bandwidth on the air-ground links and are developed and integrated independently. This 
is normal for IP-based applications and how the Internet has been designed to work. On 
the Internet all applications are independently developed, deployed and operated. Each 
application is “greedy” in claiming all the bandwidth it can use. IP applications use a 
“ramp rate” and “maximum packet size” to request bandwidth. An application starts with 
a small request, ramps up at a defined rate until it can’t increase further, then backs off 
one step. On the ground where most performance issues are caused by congestion, 
applications compete in relatively large (huge in an aviation context) resource pools, and 
there is little need for coordination between applications. During periods of congestion, 
the Internet routing infrastructure automatically throttles application bandwidth, and 
manages actual allocations to equally greedy applications. Greedy works because each 
application requests as much bandwidth as it can use and requests are resolved very 
quickly. 

In the air-ground data link environment, however, Internet congestion rules don’t work as 
well. Performance issues are not always caused by congestion, but more often by limited 
bandwidth, or by latency such as from global distribution and geo-stationary satellite 
delays, or just by poor quality on the links due to atmospheric interference. Re-allocating 
bandwidth to an air-ground route may take tens of seconds, rather than micro/ 
milliseconds with ground-side Internet. It is not always possible to determine what causes 
latency and dropped packets nor what dictates the final throughput limits that IP packets 
see on a network. When such delays and bottlenecks are combined with automatic 



OGC 14-073r1

bandwidth throttling algorithms that assume congestion, it may only further reduce the 
bandwidth available for a client or application suite. Throttling one aircraft’s request 
under a mistaken congestion assumption may then simply allow non-flight operational 
users (passengers), or another aircraft (possibly a competitor’s!) to greedily consume the 
freed-up bandwidth. Worse, if every aircraft makes greedy requests, bandwidth may 
instead be allocated to non-aviation users (i.e. oil rigs, cruise ships, off-shore gambling) 
on data link services that obtain revenue from more than just aviation flight operations 
(i.e. almost all commercial air-ground data link services). 

Only a centrally managed and operationally distributed system – one based for example 
on AGIE plus Manager of Air-Ground Information Communication (A839 MAGIC) or 
other specification for centralized management - that is knowledgeable of all bandwidth 
demands, all air-ground path options, and associated rules for both uplink and downlink 
priorities can overcome these limitations. Such a system would allow SC-206 over IP and 
AAtS to operate with appropriate delivery priorities in the context of all onboard data 
delivery and messaging requests (air-to-ground and ground-to-air), all available data 
links, and actual available bandwidth. Figure 2 provides an example of how AGIE + 
MAGIC might support management of these data flows and resources “in the large”. 

4.3 Architecture Objectives 

A harmonized architecture has been developed in order to enable the FAA and industry to 
quickly evaluate how AAtS can leverage harmonized features, topology and approach, as 
well as to show the value of AAtS for implementing a harmonized solution in airplane 
platforms and services. In order for AAtS to be successful it must embrace industry 
practices for development, certification/approval and operations. This involves cost-
effective software development, re-use of components, interoperability (for both 
development and operations), sharing of real-world data link resources, and harmonized 
operations in aircraft maintenance and operational environments. An objective, therefore, 
of the FAA harmonization effort with AAtS and SC-206, AGIE, OGC, and this document 
is to portray a common architecture that leverages as many existing services and 
functions as possible. 

From an implementer’s perspective (airline, airframe developer, avionics supplier, 
regulator, air navigation service provider (ANSP), data link service provider) the 
objective is to show a harmonized overall solution. From the perspective of an industry 
standards developer, the objective is to show a feasible approach to implementing their 
standards together in larger context. 

4.4 Architecture Approach 

The selected approach has been to define a harmonized architecture from two 
perspectives: 

1. Architecture layers and services interaction 
2. System architecture or component topology 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 13 
 

Given the close mappings between AAtS and SC-206, the focus has been on harmonized 
aspects of the AAtS and SC-206 problem space. In this vein, harmonization components 
have been defined as a set of functional capabilities/requirements from one or more 
standards packages brought together to define a “new” and “harmonized” component. 
However, critical capabilities and functions relying on only single standards are also 
briefly described. 

One aspect to this approach has been developing a simple but powerful prototype 
architecture. The prototype architecture, while intentionally simplified, provides a useful 
concrete view that could potentially be implemented. A description of the prototype 
architecture can be found in the Project Summary document. 

5 Harmonized Layered Architecture 
This section describes the layers, protocol interactions, and scoping of each of the four 
standards packages. It also discusses critical but out-of-scope standards, services, and 
functions. Most of the harmonization accomplished in this effort has taken place in what 
is described in the ISO OSI model as the “Application Layer”. This is because AAtS, SC-
206, AGIE and OGC standards rely on lower ISO layer functions and requirements but 
do not cover them except in specific cases not described here where the complexity and 
drawbacks of tighter vertical integration are deemed necessary. 

5.1 Layer Interactions 

 

Figure 4 - Harmonized Layers 

As shown in Figure 4, applicable AAtS, SC-206, AGIE and OGC functionality can be 
assigned to the Application layer between the end user (human or system) applications 
layer (displays, control, data formats) and the network layer. For simplicity, only the 
following layers and sub-layers are defined and considered here: 



OGC 14-073r1 

14 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

1. Application Layer – defined as the ISO application layer. 

2. Application Sub-layer – this upper part of the Application layer encompasses 
unique and non-reusable software and hardware functionality provided to support 
specific business and technical application needs. Included in this scope are 
application capabilities defined by AAtS and SC-206. End user specific 
application features, such as displays, controls, data formats, etc., are out of scope 
for both AAtS and SC-206 as well as this harmonization effort; however, a 
portion of AAtS and SC-206 “services” can be considered application-specific 
“business services” rather than reusable “software services”. 

3. Services and Middleware Sub-layer – the lower part of the Application layer 
focuses on reusable functions and “software services”. This layer includes most of 
the AGIE and OGC capabilities as well as software services and infrastructure 
functions in AAtS and SC-206. 

4. Network Layer – the Network layer is defined here to include all of the network 
layers in the ISO stack. This includes IP layer (network), TCP layer (transport), 
and various network control and management layers. It also includes Ethernet or 
an equivalent data link layer. All of these layers are usually combined seamlessly 
in a modern IP Router/Switch. 

5. Data link and Physical Layers – the layers below the Network layer carry out 
physical and bit-level transport. These are only of interest to harmonization in that 
air-ground data links have unique capabilities and limitations in these areas. These 
include: Ka/Ku-band satellites, L-band Inmarsat ACARS, and broadband 
VHF/HF/Iridium ACARS. Certain minimally harmonized SC-206 features pertain 
to these generally non-IP capabilities; others are out of scope for this effort. 

Figure 4 positions key harmonization standards and adjacent critical functions within the 
defined layers. 

6. AAtS and SC-206 - are positioned throughout the Application layer. There is a 
small component of each that pertains to end user applications (by standards body 
agreement) and a small component of SC-206 that pertains to non-IP 
communications has been considered in this harmonization effort. 

7. OGC – is shown supporting the Services and Middleware sub-layer, with 
emphasis on Services. This includes functions both harmonized with AGIE (as 
messaging) and standalone without AGIE. 

8. AGIE – is shown occupying a portion of the Services and Middleware sub-layer. 
Originally this was termed a transport sub-layer; this is not fully accurate but does 
in some sense describe the primary AGIE messaging capabilities. AGIE is shown 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 15 
 

both working with OGC and in a standalone capacity. AGIE is further delineated 
into: 

a. AGIE messaging – the overall AGIE functionality. 
b. AGIE service layer – an AGIE sub-layer that performs message 

management, decision making and housekeeping. 
c. AMQP transport – an AGIE sub-layer that performs the actual data 

transport between AGIE servers and clients. AMQP interfaces directly 
with the network and IP layers, primarily using TCP/IP. 

 

5.2 MIAM and ACARS Considerations 

Non-IP transports positioned below the Application layer (although not shown in Figure 
4) that have been considered in this effort include: 

1. MIAM – ARINC 841 Media Independent Aircraft Messaging is a key Airbus and 
SITA capability being rolled out for Airbus A-350 timeframe. 

2. ACARS – Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System is critical 
because the only real aircraft data communication system today for safety and 
non-safety critical applications for FAA and most of the globe is ACARS. 
ACARS is limited in performance but globally available and certifiable for some 
safety related uses with operational mitigation. 

Note: VHF,VDLm2 – VHF Data Link mode 2 (VDLm2) is a physical medium (but 
really also a data link layer) and is the primary global data communications link 
for aircraft. Inmarsat “classical satcom” falls in the same category with a very 
large penetration rate among airlines. ACARS works well over any of these 
links. Media Independent Aircraft Messaging (MIAM) is an early subset of 
AGIE functionality to be implemented 2-5 years before AGIE. It does not 
perform client-server functions; instead it works point-to-point from an onboard 
MIAM server to a single ground-side MIAM server. 

ACARS, on the other hand, is supported by nearly every ANSP globally and 
installed on nearly every commercial airplane produced in the last decade. 
Upgrades to VDLM2 have increased VHF ACARS efficiency. Inmarsat and 
Iridium are both going for safety certification with IP-based offerings, although 
those offerings still attach to most applications on most aircraft via legacy non-
IP/non-Ethernet aviation interfaces. This provides a limited but widespread 
ACARS-over-IP capability. 

MIAM has some very important benefits for consideration. 

1. MIAM is emerging in the very near-term 

2. MIAM compression greatly enhances ACARS/VHF and satcom bandwidth 



OGC 14-073r1 

16 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

3. MIAM guarantees ATC performance under all MIAM loads 

4. MIAM increases message size to 50KB from 3.3KB. 

5. MIAM is defined to integrate directly into AGIE in future AGIE deployments 

6. MIAM allows redirecting information exchange from aviation data links to IP 
based commercial data links by means of a MIAM convergence algorithm. 

The MIAM concept also includes an update to ARINC 620 which is termed “ACARS-B” 
or “ground ACARS”. This is significant as it allows use of larger (possibly XML based) 
messages in common, industry defined (ARINC 620) message formats. This will be key 
to rolling out AAtS and SC-206 for interoperability and sharing across multiple 
information providers, information consumers, and data link / data management service 
providers. AIXM, WXXM, and FIXM and air-ground derived subsets, for example, may 
be considered for future ARINC 620 formats. 

MIAM allows AGIE to use a non-IP data link with MIAM-over-ACARS. This capability 
has been agreed to by multiple AEEC committees but is not included as part of the initial 
standard. (MIAM) defines an ACARS convergence algorithm that allows native IP 
devices to communicate over the ACARS data link. These algorithms allow efficient and 
controlled access to the limited ACARS data link. AGIE and MIAM sub-committees 
have coordinated how this can/will be accomplished in the near-term. This allows MIAM 
to become a proxy between AGIE server (AMQP broker) and ACARS. However, it 
requires an adaptation to the AMQP implementation to transport messages over ACARS 
between specified AMQP brokers. While this feature has value and has been approved, 
no implementation details are captured in the current version of the standard. 

6 System Architecture and Topology 
This section provides a system architecture view for each of the standards, as well as a 
view for the harmonized system architecture. AAtS and SC-206 have very similar system 
architectures and may potentially be deployed similarly, although data sourcing varies 
considerably from one to the other. AGIE and OGC provide software services that can 
support AAtS and SC-206 functionality but also support non-AAtS related applications. 
AGIE-based systems provide message handling functions and services that are applicable 
to portions of both AAtS and SC-206 but also to other aviation domains such as cabin, 
maintenance, non-AAtS related flight operations, software parts delivery, and in-flight 
entertainment (IFE) head-end messaging. OGC standards enable interoperable systems 
that manage and process geospatial information across many domains, such as 
aeronautical, weather, flight and terrain data. The focus in the sections below is on 
aspects of the standards relevant to AAtS applications. Other applications are shown only 
for context. First the standalone system architectures are presented, and then various 
harmonized perspectives are layered over the standalone system views.  

AAtS and SC-206 system architectures may be compared quite directly as follows: 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 17 
 

 Information Sourcing: 
o Primary ground information source (and consumer of downlink 

information) is the NAS via SWIM for AAtS. There is no specifically 
defined primary information source (and consumer of downlink 
information) for SC206. 

o Private/public sector data is a non-SWIM source of information for SC-
206 but not a part of the nominal AAtS architecture. 

o AAtS architecture is directed at enterprise-level implementations whereas 
the SC-206 architecture takes into account local non-enterprise-level 
system implementations as well. 

o Overall, SC-206 recognizes global and non-SWIM ground infrastructure 
components beyond the NAS SWIM to which AAtS architecture confines 
itself. 

 AAtS and SC-206 both include a ground-side server component for filtering and 
processing. The SC-206 component is GDLPF while for AAtS it is DMS. SC-206 
describes concepts for a government funded component option as well as a 
commercial entity similar to DMS. 

 Both AAtS and SC-206 are data link agnostic but contain functions for data link 
services. The focus in terms of harmonization is support for commercial data links 
(IP plus ACARS). 

 AAtS and SC-206 both cover onboard aircraft systems. SC-206 concepts describe 
installed and mobile devices, while AAtS covers onboard functionality. Human-
machine interfaces and associated end user applications are considered beyond the 
scope of both standards. 

 Differences in application scope supported by each standard (AIS, MET & FIS vs. 
only AIS and MET) have no impact from a system architecture perspective. 

6.1 AAtS System Architecture 

AAtS has defined a system architecture made up of six top level components, two of 
which are NAS/SWIM components and four of which are commercial components 
unique to AAtS. 

 

Figure 5 - AAtS System Architecture View (Source: FAA AAtS IGD) 

NAS Data Service Provider is a NAS component that provides information for weather, 
aeronautical data and ATM data. In the case of bi-directional data flow this component 
also ingests data sent from the aircraft (such as turbulence data and PIREPS). The NAS 
SOA Service Provider component transports the NAS data from internal NAS services 
using SWIM Core Services to other SWIM nodes via SWIM SOA service interfaces. 
This information is also provided to external non-NAS consumers (or providers in bi-



OGC 14-073r1 

18 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

directional flow) via the Network External Secure Gateway (NESG) through pre-defined 
SWIM SOA-based services. 

In the context of AAtS, Data Management Service Provider (DMS) components also 
connect with the NAS SOA Service Provider via the NESG. AAtS considers that DMS 
and other external AAtS components will be provided as commercial non-FAA-funded 
services. The DMS queries / filters NAS data, and sends the appropriate data to aircraft 
and airline systems based on operator configured logic. The Aircraft Operator / Aircraft 
System is a peer component to the DMS and is the primary client (downlink or uplink) 
for exchanging data with the DMS. The DLSP is the air-ground data link service used to 
transport data between the DMS and the aircraft. While shown on par with the other 
components, it actually implements lower level transport functions. The External Access 
to DMS Provider is a set of functions used by the operator to configure, manage and 
control the AAtS system for its intended use. 

6.2 SC-206 System Architecture 

The SC-206 system architecture depicts a number of entities but the two key components 
are the Ground Data Link Processing Function (GDLPF) and the Onboard Data Link 
Processing Function (ODLPF). Most SC-206 information is considered to flow from 
ground sources to the aircraft; however, there is some air-to-ground information flow as 
well. Conceptually, the SC-206 architecture also includes provisions for air-to-air data 
flow but the harmonization effort has not focused on this.

In the SC-206 system architecture, information originates from an information provider, 
whether on the ground or in the air. Data flow, filtering and general management are 
handled by the principal system components (GDLPF/ODLPF). Information source types 
covered in this architecture include: 

 Enterprise Information Source: A ground-based program, commercial entity, or 
system that represents the system endpoint environment for enterprise-level data 
sourcing and dissemination. This environment may contain a variety of data and 
node abstractions representing the ground entities that are providing source 
information services. Access to such environments is typically through secure 
gateways. Examples of Enterprise Information Source(s) include: 

o The FAA’s NAS SWIM infrastructure; 
o SESAR’s SWIM infrastructure; 
o National Weather Service (NWS) infrastructure/ground entity;  
o Large approved commercial data warehouses and processing centers. 

 Local Data Service: This is an abstraction for scenarios where information is 
originated and transmitted with low latency in close proximity to an event. 
Potential future examples include: 

o Digitized ASOS transmissions; 
o Streamed near-real time RVR status; 
o Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS) digital transmissions; and 
o Wake vortex data transmissions. 

 Other Data Service: This is an abstraction for data and information sourcing not 
covered by the above examples. It might include such things as: 

o State AIP dissemination infrastructure. 

Most of these sources are considered to be commercial non-SWIM non-NAS data sources 
(or consumers) that are not funded by FAA. 

The primary ground-side component in the SC-206 architecture is the GDLPF. It 
processes information from available information sources and sends appropriate data to 
the aircraft. Both governmental and commercial GDLPF functions are considered within 
the architecture. This allows commonality, for example, across commercial FAA DMS’ 
and ANSP-provided SESAR components. 

Information can be transported to/from the aircraft by way of various physical data links. 
The aircraft hosts an ODLPF function that stages all of the data for the aircraft systems 
and processes, then stores and forwards it to/from the onboard systems as shown in 
Figure 7. Of note: portable systems are shown on the ground as “Off-A/C Equipage” and 
onboard as “portable devices”.

DO-340) 

6.3 AGIE System Architecture 

AGIE primarily supports message delivery between aircraft and ground systems; 
however, it also supports ground-ground messaging so that airlines can stage large files to 
globally distributed locations. AGIE also supports onboard messaging between different 
applications on the same aircraft without routing via air-ground data link, in order to 
reduce air-ground data link costs. 

The principal AGIE components are AGIE servers and AGIE clients. The AGIE 
architecture consists of one or more fixed ground-side servers that connect dynamically 
with AGIE onboard servers. The connections are dynamic as accessibility and addressing 
change continually: aircraft move geographically, and access varies with the availability 
of air-ground data links. AGIE clients are software interfaces implemented by or on 
behalf of end user applications so that they can exchange data with the local  (host) AGIE 
server. Communication between two applications generally follows the path (see Figure 
8): 

source application à source client à source host  
à (optional intermediate storage and processing server)  
à destination host à destination client à destination application. 

AGIE servers are logical components and may be hosted as a single server or as functions 
distributed across multiple physical components. One set of functions required on a 
ground AGIE server is termed “Primary Server”. This performs system configuration and 
control and is the access point for the admin client and application. Each AGIE 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 21 
 

component consists of two functional layers. The service layer provides messaging and 
infrastructure services to applications, while the AMQP layer provides lower-level 
transport services. 

A basic AGIE topology would consist of a single ground server hosting all ground-side 
functions and a single onboard server on each aircraft. A more complex topology might 
add multiple globally distributed ground-side servers sharing AGIE functions, providing 
higher availability, lower latency, and reduced cost. The simplest possible AGIE 
topology might consist of a single ground-side server and only onboard clients. While 
less efficient than server-server links, it could be of value in mixed or GA fleets where 
some aircraft carry AGIE onboard servers but others only support mobile onboard clients. 
This architecture might be suitable for aircraft with passenger in-flight entertainment 
(IFE) based air-ground data links but no substantial onboard computing resources beyond 
tablet-based EFB’s. 

 

Figure 8 - AGIE Topology with Multiple Servers 

The most sophisticated AGIE topology would be one that employs multiple isolated sub-
networks or partitions. These partitions would allow admins to configure secure, separate 
domains with limited and well-controlled interaction. This might be useful for ATM 
applications, where there are onboard passenger and cabin services needing to be isolated 
from the flight deck and avionics systems in order to maintain security necessary for 
regulatory approval.  Sub-network isolation could be physical or logical or both 
depending on security and regulatory considerations. Physical separation could involve 
separate hardware and software servers and clients, separate air-ground data links or 



OGC 14-073r1 

22 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

channels within a data link (or separate air-ground control VLANs c.f. ARINC 792). 
Logical separation could involve software functions, limited access between clients and 
servers and/or servers and servers, AGIE node visibility limits, message type limitations, 
data link access restrictions, or methods for public association. 

Typical aircraft environments or domains are defined in ARINC 664 Part 5, including: 
Aircraft Control Domain (ACD), Airline Information Services Domain (AISD), 
Passenger In-flight Entertainment and Services Domain (PIESD) and Passenger Owned 
Device Services Domain (PODSD). ACD typically consists of safety approved avionics; 
AISD consists typically of EFB’s and other flight operations equipment that may or may 
not be safety critical (such as most new IP-enabled flight operations devices). PIESD 
typically comprises a full passenger entertainment system and may include seat-based 
cabin services as well as air-ground connectivity. The bulk of IP-enabled air-ground 
communications is in fact managed by or provides services to PIESD. Each domain has 
unique rules, and security requirements and considerations. Cross-domain functionality 
such as represented by AGIE will typically support applications in more than one 
domain. In the example below, security rules require AGIE to support each domain 
separately in order to maintain “provable domain separation”.

6.4 OGC System Architecture 

OGC standards provide support for a wide range of use cases involving geospatial 
information, and thus have multi-domain applicability, e.g. Aviation, Defense & 
Intelligence, Emergency Response & Disaster Management, Energy & Utilities, Land & 
Infrastructure, Meteorology, etc. Since both the data types and the client applications 
usually vary from domain to domain, however, the standards are typically implemented 
in systems that serve specific domains. 

OGC standards generally fall into one of two groups: geospatial information encodings 
on one side, and service interfaces on the other. The former specify how geospatial 
information is to be modeled and encoded for exchanging between systems, while the 
latter specify how relevant information can be discovered, processed, and disseminated in 
a conformant system. With respect to the Aviation domain, OGC service standards 
support: 

 Discovery of information and services that meet an application’s or user’s needs; 
 Access to and dissemination of geospatial information: 

o as feature (vector) and/or coverage (raster) data; 
o filtered, projected and transformed by client request; 
o portrayed using pre-configured or client-specific styles and symbology, 

provided as pre-created map tiles or rendered on-the-fly; 
o delivered upon request or whenever relevant information is available; 

 Execution of common processing tasks, such as computing the geometry of 
aeronautical features and creating customized maps for inclusion in pre-flight 
information bulletins; 

 Securing service access to ensure integrity and confidentiality of information. 

Within a distributed system, OGC standards are applied as interfaces between system 
endpoints to enable the exchange of information in a way that enhances both functional 
and information interoperability. In an aviation system, for example, interfaces to SWIM 
systems and other data providers could be based on OGC standards such as the OGC 
Web Map Service, Web Feature Service, or Web Coverage Service) for convenient and 
reliable information access. OGC service interfaces support rich functionality to query 
and process geospatial information (for example: aeronautical, weather, flight, and terrain 
information), so that standards-based clients can receive the information they need when 
they need it without the need to support multiple vendor or technology-specific 
application programming interfaces (API’s). 

6.5 Harmonized System Architecture Mapping 
6.5.1 SC-206 to AAtS Mapping 

The AAtS architecture and the architecture defined by RTCA SC-206 are very similar: 
their concepts and functions often map directly to one another.

6.5.2 AGIE to SC-206 System Architecture Mapping 

Mapping to the AGIE system architecture is complicated by the many options available 
for AGIE deployment. For the purposes of this report, a typical AGIE installation has 
been assumed, with a few variations based on prominent options (Figure 10).  

Near-Term: In the near-term it is assumed that NAS systems will not employ AGIE as a 
messaging system due to SWIM contracts and FAA program constraints.  Under this 
assumption, the ground-side configuration is very simple with only a single ground AGIE 
server for an entire airline (though only one aircraft is shown). Ground-side AGIE clients 
are implemented on the GDLPF and inside of the MET and AIS data sources, as well as 
on ground-based Class 1 or 2 EFB’s. While what is depicted is a single AGIE Ground 
server in the baseline system, an AGIE server could be employed to handle SC-206 
functions in/for the GDLPF in addition to the other airline AGIE ground servers. In 
addition to the basic SC-206 ground-side components, AOC/FOC and other airline 
operations are depicted as sharing information using the same ground-side AGIE server1. 
The aircraft-side is also depicted as a single AGIE server with AGIE clients on the 
airplane systems (FMF, etc.) and portable devices (EFBs, etc.). 

Depicted in blue lines is an example of a partitioned AGIE system with an onboard AGIE 
server and client in the cabin area, and an In Flight Entertainment (IFE) system such as 
from Panasonic managing its own data-link for passenger information services. The red-
line connection to the cabin client would be deactivated in this scenario. In a partitioned 
system the onboard server would be limited in its server-server connectivity, as well as in 
its client visibility. In such a case the onboard cabin server would be connected to a cabin 
ground AGIE server connected in turn to ground AGIE cabin domain clients. The ground 
client red-line would again be deactivated in this flow. 

AGIE would route traffic between the onboard server(s) and ground server(s) using all IP 
data links available based on admin configuration of priorities, costs and regulations. 
Even though connection arrows are shown as bi-directional, association between air and-
ground could only be initiated by the aircraft equipment.  

Note that portable devices are depicted on both the aircraft and the ground on the 
assumption that they are continually being carried back and forth but clients only 
associate with a single host server at a time. Onboard-only clients never associate with 
ground servers and ground-only clients never associate with an onboard server while 
mobile clients may switch their association. 

                                                

1 The AGIE Ground Server could also be deployed in a commercial GDLPF in a manner similar to the government 
GDLPF. This emphasizes that multiple deployment options are possible.

Figure 10 - AGIE to SC-206 System Architecture Map 

Long-Term: In the long-term, if AGIE is successful and SWIM contracts are modified to 
recognize AGIE, many ground-side information sources and consumers could become 
AGIE-aware. One could conceive of additional elements on the NAS side that connect to 
AGIE ground clients. Depicted in Figure 10 is a possible future state (black connectivity 
and gray bubbles) with a NAS ground-side AGIE server and associated ground-side 
AGIE clients connected to it in an isolated NAS AGIE sub-network dedicated to NAS 
ground-side information messaging. The value to NAS would be the opportunity to 
leverage a larger commercial ecosystem of AGIE-ready data sources and consumers.  

6.5.3 OGC Mapping 

The nature of the capabilities that OGC services provide allow for multiple tiered and 
concurrent levels of various functions. Since the standards focus on interfaces and high-
level information exchange formats rather than platforms or internal implementation 
details, they can be implemented as interactions between components arranged in many 
system configurations and topologies. The addition of interoperable messaging 
capabilities such provided by AGIE can result in an even wider variety of possible 
implementation topologies to satisfy different implementation requirements. Examples of 
multiple interfaces include: 

 Multiple filtering levels – OGC services can be used at a variety of points for 
filtering, such as in multiple stages of data provisioning chains, allowing 
increasingly selective data subsets to be staged towards end user applications in 
order to balance bandwidth requirements with rapid access. Example scenario: 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 27 
 

o The DMS makes an information request to OGC-enabled SWIM services 
which return a geo-filtered response dependent upon the DMS client 
region and domain needs. This response is then stored internally for 
servicing multiple airborne clients 

o The aircraft makes an information request to the DMS. The DMS responds 
using its internal data cache with a further geo-filtered response unique to 
the needs of the requesting aircraft. This response may then be stored 
onboard for reuse. 

o Various onboard systems make information requests based on their 
particular requirement (e.g., weather, AIM, location based, etc.) to fulfill 
operational needs. 

o Smaller datasets are rendered into maps specifically styled for each 
application via onboard portrayal services, while larger datasets can be 
requested as relatively small map images from ground-based portrayal 
services using the same map request interface 

Note: the above example assumes that each “stage” will store or cache the received 
information in some manner for reuse and redistribution with further relevant filtering 
possible 

 Distributed discovery – OGC interfaces for registering, finding, and binding to 
services and their content offerings can be implemented wherever services are 
being made available dynamically to clients. Service and content discovery can 
follow a star pattern, where for example a catalog service implemented as part of 
a DMS cascades search requests on to catalog service interfaces implemented by 
each of the components that supply data to it.  Discovery can also follow a similar 
pipeline pattern to that of multilevel filtering, where the NAS, DMS, and onboard 
servers each provide an OGC catalog interface that supports searches for services 
and content staged to and available at that time from that component. 

 Processing workflows – components implementing OGC services and encodings 
can be linked into distributed workflows  to cover a significant range of the 
service functionality needed to work effectively with any geospatially 
characterized information, including search / discovery of datasets by location, 
provision / selection / transformation of feature data in numerous forms and 
formats, custom map image styling / portrayal, transactions such as inserting and 
updating feature data, and processing tasks such as data integration, routing, or 
imagery analysis.  

How these services map internally and against the other services is described below.

6.5.3.1 OGC to SC-206 System Architecture Mapping 

Without assuming a specific implementation architecture, OGC standards can be mapped 
into specific subsets of the SC-206 architecture. This means that specific functionality of 
components built for this architecture can be realized using OGC standards. It does not 
remove the need for custom code to process information appropriately within an SC-206 
component since that is not now covered by OGC specifications2.  

OGC standards could be implemented as service interfaces of the GDLPF and ODLPF, 
and also as features of internal modules of these system entities (see Table 2 and Table 
3).

2 The situation could be improved if a technical specification were created defining the functionality to be realized for a 
specific component (component interfaces plus processing between interfaces). In the OGC Testbed 9, for example, 
two independent but interoperable prototypical implementations of a DMS/GDLPF were developed that realized a large 
portion of DMS/GDLPF functionality. Such a specification would support the development of standards-based, 
interoperable commercial-off-the-shelf DMS/GDLPF components and reduce the need for proprietary custom software.

There already is a significant amount of OGC support for discovering, managing and 
distributing aeronautical and weather data, but other types of information could also be 
supported, such as flight and terrain information.  

NOTE: unless only an image representation of geospatial information is of interest, there are some 
constraints regarding data encodings. AIXM and WXXM are encodings based on GML and other 
OGC standards that are used for data exchange in SWIM environments. In multiple system 
implementations and demonstrations OGC services have been proven to work with these encodings. 
The OGC Web Feature Service (OGC WFS) for example utilizes AIXM and WXXM as data 
encodings when used to access aeronautical and weather information3. 

OGC standards and technology have also demonstrated significant support for security 
and data transformation/mediation functions. When incorporated in the GDLPF and 
ODLPF, OGC standards could support a major subset of the information processing 
requirements. They provide interfaces for accessing and inserting information (e.g. 
aeronautical and weather), which could then be invoked by client software in aircraft 
systems and portable devices. Figure 11 depicts in more detail how OGC standards can 
be mapped to data exchange interfaces at GDLPF and ODLPF as well as elsewhere in a 
harmonized architecture. Client software – for example on mobile devices – could also 
use OGC service interfaces to retrieve and insert information. Client software would not 
have to implement OGC standards and GDLPF and ODLPF could support other 
interfaces and data formats. However, if GDLPF and ODLPF were already to utilize 
OGC standards within the harmonized architecture, there would be significant benefit in 
directly leveraging this functionality within client software as well. Likewise, 

                                                

3 The OGC WFS standard requires that a conformant server work with feature data modeled as a GML application 
schema and served in one or more compatible encodings.

implementation of GDLPF would be simplified if information sources also implemented 
OGC standards for encodings and service interfaces. 

 

 

Figure 11 - OGC to SC-206 System Architecture Map 

6.5.3.2 OGC to AGIE Mapping 

OGC services are defined as transport protocol independent so that they may leverage 
any transport protocol for which a suitable protocol binding has been defined. A protocol 
binding defines how system endpoints can be addressed, and also how the messages and 
message exchange patterns defined in the standard (e.g. datagram, request-response, and 
publish/subscribe) are realized with a given protocol. OGC services bindings are 
commonly defined for HTTP and SOAP. SOAP is a messaging protocol that is itself 
transport protocol independent, and thus can be used on top of specific transport 
protocols (like HTTP and AMQP) as long as a SOAP binding is in turn defined for it. 
Within the harmonized architecture developed here, OGC services are envisioned to 
leverage AGIE message bindings. There is some overlap between SOAP and AGIE 
message handling functionality, so OGC services could either be bound directly to AGIE 
for all message handling functions, or via existing OGC SOAP bindings such that SOAP-
handled messages would be transported in turn via AMQP.  

 

7 Recommended High-level System Architecture 

A new harmonized high-level system architecture has been developed from the standards 
analysis and mapping presented above. It is recommended that the new architecture 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 31 
 

become central to AAtS IGD V4.0 and form the basis for initial global interoperability 
discussions. 

The new architecture is the result of expanding the AAtS and OGC harmonization scope 
(as defined in Phase 1 OGC documents) to include any/all relevant industry and aviation 
standards as well as air-ground architectures that share operational data, data formats, 
architectural elements, or computing and networking resources (e.g. ground or onboard 
computing and networking resources and air-ground data links). The initial OGC-led 
harmonization work was “up leveled” to a higher level of abstraction and widened within 
the scope described above to include non-AAtS and non-NAS unique services at a global 
level. 

As a first step in portraying development of the new architecture, the US FAA/NAS 
AAtS architecture (Figure 14) has been redrawn (Figure 15) with more generic and re-
usable components as a baseline to which new components, sub-components and 
connections derived from the industry standards harmonization work in Phase 1 are then 
added (Figure 16). The scope of the architecture is expanded further by considering a 
global scenario in which a US domestic aircraft flies internationally (Figure 18). This 
progression is presented in system-wide topology diagrams that depict the data and 
information flows and critical interactions between system components. The 
communications protocol layers that support the architecture are presented in Figure 17 to 
show how and where industry standard services and solutions fit into an emerging 
aviation network environment where components interact through open protocols rather 
than within a “black box”. 

The evolution of a recommended architecture is intended to convey how basic AAtS 
FAA concepts can be realized in a larger context, as well as to recognize what industry 
sees as key technical and business interactions and emphasize the need for international 
coordination. Ideally this will empower industry partners and global regulators to engage 
in discussions leading to a deeper understanding of the architecture and an international 
consensus that supports integrated AAtS capabilities for international flights of US and 
foreign carriers. 

7.1 Standalone FAA/NAS AAtS Architecture 

This section summarizes the key elements of the top-level FAA NAS-centric AAtS 
architecture as defined in AAtS IGD v3.0. Below is a new form of depiction that is the 
basis of expanding to a global harmonized context. 

Figure 12 is drawn directly from the FAA AAtS IGD v3.0 document. It depicts the high 
level FAA/NAS-centric AAtS architecture from an AAtS-centric and standalone point of 
view, including the following system components: 

NAS Data Service Provider – represents FAA NAS services that provide (and for 
downlink consume) AAtS information. The focus for AAtS is on “advisory” or “non-
trajectory controlling” information for weather, aeronautical and ATM services. It 
is shown in green indicating it is managed and funded by FAA. 



OGC 14-073r1 

32 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

NAS SOA Service Provider – represents FAA managed and provided functionality. 
SWIM is shown as “SWIM Core Services”. Also shown is the Network External 
Secure Gateway (NESG) which is the secure access and data/information exchange 
interface/PoP to all non-FAA/government partners for exchanging data/information 
within the SWIM and bi-directional AAtS scope. These elements are also managed 
and funded by FAA. It is important to note that while NESG is shown only 
connecting to the DMS Provider, it does connect to aircraft operators and other 
ground systems that require access to SWIM, in addition to the AAtS usage shown in 
this diagram. 

 

 

Figure 12 - AAtS IGD v3.0 Architecture 

DMS Provider - represents the key ground-based component and business concept 
introduced by the AAtS architecture. The DMS provider is manager of the DMS 
system. The DMS system is the interface between the SWIM SOA systems (via 
NESG) and aircraft (via air-ground datalink). The DMS also connects to airline 
operator portals for managing DMS configuration. DMS is a non-FAA funded and 
managed component supported from aircraft operations funding sources. 

Aircraft Operator – represents the airline or other aircraft operations that are 
responsible for flying/operating the aircraft. The only element shown is Aircraft 
Systems. Aircraft Systems contain all of the onboard elements of AAtS and the 
onboard systems required to exchange AAtS data/information via air-ground data 
links. It also includes the flight crew! It does not include built-in or mobile display 
systems or top-level flight operations applications. Mobile devices (iPad or tablet 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 33 
 

enabled EFBs) used for operational purposes by flight crew as well as aircraft fixed 
devices are included within this component. 

DLSP – Represents the air-ground data link service provider. The key element here 
is the air-ground data link service, which consists of the air-ground data link, 
onboard data link equipment and functions, and ground-side data link equipment, 
functions and gateways. 

External Access to DMS – represents the airline portal (likely as an AOC or FOC) 
that is used to configure, manage, monitor and control DMS operations. This 
component manages information and data exchange between NAS/SWIM and the 
aircraft systems/flight crew. 

 

 

Figure 13 – Standalone FAA/NAS AAtS Architecture 

Figure 13 is a streamlined depiction of the FAA standalone AAtS architecture shown in 
Figure 14. AAtS IGD v3.0 provides much more details than required for this report, but 
should be consulted for the detailed functionality and meaning of each component. Some 
component names have been modified as well for clarity. In this and the diagrams 
following, only technical definitions and components are explicitly considered. Service 
providers and other business actors are implied but not shown in diagrams. Diagram 
elements shown are as follows: 

NAS – represents “NAS Data Service Provider and NAS services”. Attached are 
shown other government sources and FAA ATC components. The NESG is simply 
named “SWIM GW” or “SWIM Gateway”. All NAS internal connections are shown 
as “NAS defined” and not-IP based. SWIM-to-industry links are shown as 
“Regulatory defined”, for SWIM they are IP based with ground rules for security that 
provide access, security, point-of-presence, and other key attributes. 



OGC 14-073r1 

34 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

DMS – represents the same DMS, however an internal component named “AAtS” is 
shown to allow growing the DMS functionality in the following diagrams and 
discussions. 

AOC – represents the airline or aircraft operators interface to AAtS for DMS 
management (External Access to DMS). It is assumed to be the airline AOC or FOC 
or equivalent for GA operations. It is shown as an AAtS DMS Manager here and is 
included as a sub-component of the AOC. 

Mobile – represents mobile devices. These are implied and discussed in AAtS IGD 
v3.0 but are not shown in their diagrams. Mobile devices are shown attached to either 
airplane or ground (AOC) and migrate over time. This is important to understanding 
operational use of and security considerations for AAtS as envisioned by FAA. 

Data Link Environment – represents the multiple data link service options 
provided by data link service providers. The environment is shown to allow 
comprehension that there may be more than one data link and service per aircraft and 
certainly more than one for any DMS. 

Onboard AAtS – is represented as two separate components as defined below. They 
represent the IGD’s “Aircraft Systems”. 

 eEnabled Aircraft – represents an aircraft that is configured to be AAtS 
enabled and for which onboard fixed AAtS functionality exists. This 
allows full AAtS business value and all operationally defined AAtS data 
exchanges. Some of these require onboard systems to perform localized 
information exchange, storage, filtering and redistribution. The Onboard 
AAtS is depicted to include: (1) software services and (2) onboard 
applications. Software services include re-usable onboard AAtS 
infrastructure functions while AAtS applications provide AAtS (and 
possibly SC-206) uniquely defined functionality. It is key for software 
services to be re-usable for more than just AAtS. Also depicted are pilot, 
displays, avionics, and onboard hosted mobile devices. These are 
introduced as part of the AAtS standalone architecture but are not part of 
IGD architecture as they are not considered part of the management space 
of the AAtS organization (same for SC-206). 

 Aircraft with Mobile AAtS Only – represents an aircraft that does not 
support any fixed AAtS functionality. AAtS functions are limited to those 
applicable to mobile devices only accessed by a pilot directly from a data 
link (likely managed for passenger connectivity reasons. 

Connections – are represented as follows. 

1. NAS: Internal NAS connections defined by NAS and non-standard 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 35 
 

2. RegDef: External NAS (NESG) connections defined by NAS regulation 
and defined as IP with constraints 

3. IP:  

a. Ground side IP connections which may be Internet or private IP 
networks. 

b. Internal aircraft connections which are IP over Ethernet or IP over 
wireless. 

4. Data link: Air-ground data links using RF methods, but sharing data via 
IP at the network level. Though non-IP protocols may be used they are not 
considered baseline capabilities in this discussion and architecture. 

Responsibilities – are represented as follows. 

1. FAA is shown as gray 

2. DMS is shown as green 

3. Aircraft operators are shown as blue 

4. Commercial services are shown as yellow 

5. Other ANSPs and non-FAA SWIM’s are shown as mauve 

6. Unknown or TBD is shown as white 

7.2 Industry Harmonized FAA/NAS AAtS Architecture  

This section now expands on the standalone FAA/NAS AAtS architecture to include an 
industry standards based solutions perspective. It describes a broader scope that includes 
AAtS functionality in a “real-world” environment of today’s solutions and systems that 
are likely to share resources and data/information with AAtS functions, systems or sub-
system components. The scope is still FAA/NAS-centric, representing the environment 
for a US domestic operator flying US domestic flights. 



OGC 14-073r1 

36 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

 

Figure 14 – FAA AAtS Harmonized Architecture 

Figure 14 depicts the standalone FAA/NAS architecture harmonized with industry 
standards and industry/commercial solutions that exist or are emerging. Key changes are 
described below. 

Commercial Information Sources – represents commercial sources of information 
in addition to just SWIM/NAS information (sources implies sinks/consumers as 
well). These are commercial entities attached to the DMS and AOC via IP links that 
provide similar, enhanced or other data for flight operations. This information may 
overlap and/or augment SWIM NAS information. Further it may be processed like 
the DMS will but by a separated commercial vendor. It is shown with AI, ATM and 
weather products. 

Mobile device – is represented connected to both AOC and DMS in this architecture. 
That is the DMS may perform data exchange with mobile devices via AOC (airline 
enterprise connectivity) or via DMS Internet access directly. This is especially likely 
for smaller airlines and GA operations that don’t have a complex, globally reaching 
enterprise environment. 

DMS – contains a new sub-component Other Services. These other services provide 
additional business value beyond and above AAtS defined services and may be in 
any operationally relevant domain. FAA mentions the likely need of this capability to 
make the DMS providers’ business cases close. 

AOC – contains several new sub-components. Other information provides for non-
NAS information to be exchanged with the aircraft from commercial sources but in 
AAtS domain. Dispatch is a key AOC/FOC sub-component that is discussed in IGD 
but not shown in diagram. The concept of collaborative decision making is now 
depicted on this diagram with ATC, pilot and dispatcher. Other (non-AAtS) domains 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 37 
 

are shown in AOC for completeness for DMS, airline operations and resource 
sharing purposes. Shown are: weather, maintenance, flight operations and 
passenger in-flight entertainment functions. 

Other Domain Information Sources – is represented as a new component that 
brings in key players from non-AAtS domains for information exchange. Depicted as 
examples are other information and equipment suppliers, software suppliers and 
airframers/OEMs. 

eEnabled Aircraft – is represented with additional sub-components. An onboard 
message manager (MM) is shown to manage one or multiple externally (non-AAtS) 
managed onboard datalink services. Two are shown to depict MM in multiple 
domains (i.e. ACD and AISD separated from PIESD MM). Also shown are cabin, 
maintenance and IFE functions and IFE passenger (PAX) components. These are 
important aspects of the AAtS context as they drive the business benefits as well as 
security and onboard networking and resource architectures. 

Aircraft Mobile AAtS – also includes sub-components of a non-AAtS managed 
onboard data link service and IFE and Passenger connectivity. 

 

Figure 15 – AAtS Layers 

AAtS Layered Standard and Solutions – industry standards and solutions are migrating 
(albeit only lately in aviation) to cooperating solutions. The old fully vertical product 
(black box) is giving way to industry solutions that provide infrastructure-style functions 
and services for aviation applications to build on. This allows re-use of equipment, 
software, certifications/approvals and security features. Examples of this are: ARINC-



OGC 14-073r1 

38 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

830 AGIE, ARINC-791 Ka/Ku-band solutions, EFB, NIS security, and data link network 
services. 

Figure 15 shows an example of some of the industry standards and solutions evaluated by 
this harmonization effort and provides a general perspective on where these functions, 
services or layer-specific solutions might fit in the vertical stack of computation and data 
exchange protocols. Also represented are existing and emerging non-native-IP solutions 
that are applicable to the AAtS harmonized context. The intent is to provide a framework 
for industry standards developers and aviation solution providers to map their products 
and components into the AAtS harmonized architecture. This is essential for realizing a 
cohesive architecture that encompasses application needs in multiple aviation domains. 

7.3 Globally Harmonized AAtS Architecture  

This section expands on the industry harmonized FAA/NAS AAtS architecture to include 
a global perspective. It describes a broader scope that includes AAtS functionality in a 
worldwide environment with international flights requiring sharing of and data linking 
via international partners, both commercial and ANSP/regulatory. 

 

Figure 16 – FAA/NAS AAtS Architecture in Global or International Context 

Figure 16 shows the industry harmonized FAA AAtS architecture in a global context, as 
might be leveraged by a US domestic aircraft flying internationally and needing to 
exchange global information. It is the recommended architecture for AAtS IGD v4.0. 

Only two additional components are added to the industry harmonized FAA/NAS 
architecture: Other ANSP and Other SWIM. These are shown as being accessed and 



OGC 14-073r1 

Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 39 
 

exchanging information either directly with another SWIM or with multiple DMS access 
points. Also represented are multiple DMS providers and DMS’s. 

Other SWIM – represents international SWIM solutions beyond just FAA/NAS 
SWIM. These are SWIM or network-centric SOA based solutions for non-US 
domestic and non-NAS information exchange. It is envisioned that these external 
SWIM’s will provide information for flight operations that extend beyond the present 
NAS scope and domain. 

Other ANSP - represents international ANSP solutions beyond just FAA/NAS 
SWIM and other international SWIM’s. These are non-SWIM or non-network-
centric, non-SOA based solutions for non-US domestic and non-NAS information 
exchange. It is envisioned that these external ANSPs will at least in the near-future 
be non-SWIM compliant. International operations will still require international data 
exchange before global SWIM solutions become viable, though, given FAA’s intent 
to lead AAtS capabilities in a global context and provide for collaborative decision 
making via SWIM by 2018. 

Connectivity – there are several ways inter-SWIM (e.g. inter-SWIM and SWIM-to-
ANSP) information exchanges may be accomplished. Only two are described in this 
document they are (1) ground-based SWIM-to-SWIM exchange, and (2) DMS-to-
multiple-SWIM exchange. Other options such multiple aircraft-to-SWIM stacks were 
considered but determined to be inadvisable or impractical. 

 SWIM-to-SWIM information exchange – is the preferred option with 
maximum benefits and few drawbacks from a DMS, aircraft operator, 
equipment provider, and airframer perspective. It is not, however, considered 
attainable in the reasonably near term for global international operations, since 
it would require rolling out and coordinating global SWIM capabilities across 
the entire world. In this approach all information would be sourced, vetted, 
validated and managed by individual SWIM’s in a cohesive global SWIM 
SOA information space. A DMS, aircraft, or AOC would just connect to its 
local SWIM and have access to all global operational information. 

 DMS-to-multiple-SWIM information exchange – is the second best but 
most feasible option. Each DMS would determine the regions of the globe it 
must support and connect directly to the SWIM’s or ANSP’s or commercial 
services for those areas. Each DMS in this case would have a considerably 
more complex role brokering between multiple SWIM instances, but each 
aircraft and airline AOC would only need to implement a single connection to 
its selected DMS. While this does not provide a seamless global information 
fabric per se, it does allow the complexity to be managed by the DMS 
provider and focuses on the DMS providers’ business cases and solutions, 
which could more easily be tailored to the operators they support. One 
consideration in terms of sharing information between FAA AAtS/NAS-
SWIM and (for example) Euro-SWIM might be differing rules for what data 



OGC 14-073r1 

40 Copyright © 2014 Open Geospatial Consortium 
 

are to be contained in SWIM. This might drive different DMS functions and 
requirements depending on the location of the supported airline operators and 
airline operations. SWIM-SWIM exchanges would be more likely to assume 
similar data catalogs for each SWIM. 

 

8 Conclusions and Recommendations 
The focus of this project has been to bring new perspectives in architecture, standards 
implementation, and functional scope to the FAA’s AAtS concept, identify gaps and 
conflicts, then work towards both updates for the relevant standards and an updated AAtS 
architecture in order to achieve a more harmonized and interoperable solution for air-
ground information exchange.  

This report presents the results of this work and makes specific recommendations for 
consideration and adjudication by policy makers, government, and industry to ensure a 
fully operational and harmonized AAtS architecture. Additionally, a recommended high-
level AAtS system architecture has been included to provide guidance for update of the 
AAtS IGD (e.g. v4.0). 

The true measure of success for this work will be its ability to drive stakeholder 
consideration, public policy, standards formulation, and requirement baselines that lead 
towards a fully functional and fully scoped harmonized AAtS architecture. The 
harmonization efforts reported here have already resulted in both operational standards 
and documents that are more closely aligned and have minimal direct conflict on key 
attributes and requirements. Members of the harmonization effort engaged and actively 
participated in the development and cross-pollination of standards work products. 
RTCA’s DO-349 and ARINC’s AGIE 830 specification were materially changed through 
these efforts which would not have occurred without them. Some alignment still needs to 
be achieved, as documented in this report, for example some AGIE alignment with OGC 
standards and subsequent mapping of both to AAtS/SC-206 functions still requires 
further work. This work would benefit immensely from the implementation experience of 
prototype development. 

At a minimum, however, the efforts reported here have led to a better understanding of 
the relationships between AAtS, SC-206, AGIE and OGC and no roadblock to common 
usage of these standards has been identified. As a result of this work and the resulting 
harmonized architecture, aircraft operators implementing AAtS will be able to leverage 
prevailing industry standards to deploy and participate in AAtS more easily, less 
expensively, and with lower risk.  

8.1 Conclusions 

An in-depth analysis of existing AAtS documentation was performed as part of this 
harmonization effort including the AAtS Implementation Guidance Document (IGD) v3

and the AAtS Bi-Directional ConOps version 1.0. The analysis resulted in a set of 
detailed and specific recommendations and comments by industry intended to assist in 
the maturation of the AAtS concepts and guidance provided by the FAA. This analysis 
together with the results of work in this project as a whole, has led to the following 
conclusions: 

1. A harmonized architecture based on AAtS with SC-206, AGIE and OGC 
standards is achievable and provides a framework for deploying AAtS in a multi-
domain solution. 

2. Harmonization across these three standards in the AAtS architecture allows the 
features of each standard to be implemented together in a consistent system.  

3. The AAtS architecture as defined in IGD v3.0 is too constraining to fully reflect 
the capabilities and benefits of the harmonized architecture. 

8.2 Recommendations 

Another result of the project activities reported here was a set of recommendations for 
further work to improve AAtS-related standards, documents and concepts. While the 
standards from which the recommended system architecture was developed are more 
harmonized now than they would have been otherwise, there remains considerable work 
to undertake. Recommendations for further work include:  

1. Recommend revision of the AAtS IGD v3.0 based on the team review comments 
and recommendations as well as the recommended system architecture presented 
in this report. As discussed previously, the team has performed a detailed industry 
based review of the guidance found in the AAtS IGD V3. Updated 
implementation guidance will provide value to all stakeholders involved in 
deploying an AAtS solution. The industry representatives within the team 
recommend the adoption and incorporation of team input that includes the 
following concepts: 

 Non-SWIM data sourcing inclusion in the architecture of AAtS 
 A role for safety critical applications within the AAtS trade space 
 Updates to the AAtS architecture to reflect the larger environment, 

facilitate more recognizable industry business value, and support more 
achievable global interoperability 

2. Recommend development and testing of a prototype implementation of the 
harmonized architecture – a prototype is necessary to show industry value as well 
as technical readiness in a harmonized AAtS solution that leverages industry 
standards as well as to spur industry adoption. Prototyping efforts often lead as 
well to industry practices that motivate additional standards development. 

3. Recommend follow-on harmonization work covering additional industry 
standards – while the work performed under this effort was worthwhile and has 
resulted in significant progress towards achieving interoperable solutions, it 
cannot be considered complete or comprehensive across the industry or even the 
complete AAtS architecture. Within the constraints of a realistic budget, it is 
recommended that further work investigate harmonization issues with ARINC
