i.     Abstract




This OGC standard is a profile of the OGC GML Application Schema - Coverages version 1.0 [OC 09-146r2]. That document was renamed "OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS)" for clarification in version 1.1. This standard specifies the usage of the GRIB2 data format for the encoding of OGC coverages. The GRIB2 specification is maintained by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and is the standard encoding for the exchange and storage of general regularly distributed information expressed in binary form.

iii.   Preface




Coverages represent digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena. OGC Abstract Topic 6 [OGC 07-011] - which is identical to ISO 19123 - defines an abstract model of coverages. Due to the generality of the ISO 19123 model, implementations of the model are not always interoperable. The OGC CIS establishes a concise, interoperable coverage model based on ISO 19123. Coverage instances represented according to the CIS version 1.1 [OGC 09-146r3] may be encoded in GML (based on the Geography Markup Language (GML) version 3.2 [OGC 07-036]) or other suitable ASCII or binary formats.




This CIS profile specifies the usage of the GRIB2 data format for the encoding of OGC coverages. The profile is based on the authoritative format specification available in the WMO Manual on Codes.

1. Scope



This OGC GML Application Schema – Coverages - GRIB2 Coverage Encoding Profile - henceforth abbreviated as "CIS for GRIB2" - specifies an encoding of coverages in the GRIB2 data exchange format.




The GRIB edition 2 (GRIB2) format specification [GRIB2] is designed for the exchange and storage of general regularly distributed information in binary form. GRIB2 is primarily used to represent the outputs of numerical weather prediction models, but is in no way restricted to this domain. GRIB2 was preceded by GRIB edition 0 and GRIB edition 1. The differences between both of these formats, however, are of such structural magnitude that they can be seen as different formats. For this reason, GRIB editions 0 and 1 are outside the scope of this CIS for GRIB2 standard.




A GRIB2 file is composed of one or more GRIB2 messages, which are composed of several sections providing metadata and one or more 2D arrays of values. The values can be mapped from image space to corresponding points in model space. The 2d array of values can have a rectangular spatial shape. However other, non-regular coordinate systems can be used. Additionally, grid points are not necessarily representative of rectangular areas. Some coordinate systems used in GRIB2 represent their data using triangular grid cells (cf. GRIB2 format specification [GRIB2]).




In the near future it is to be expected that a new GRIB edition (GRIB edition 3) is approved by WMO. When the standard has been finalized and agreed upon, an appropriate encoding profile will be created which allows exchange of data encoded in GRIB3 as Coverages.




The only coverage types supported by this standard are cis:GridCoverage, cis:RectifiedGridCoverage, cis:ReferenceableGridCoverage, and any coverage type derived from these two types.




Following the notation of the abstract coverage definition as specified in the CIS [OGC 09-146r2], the rangeType is limited according to the GRIB2 specification.








2. Conformance



This standard defines the following requirements and conformance class:




	
grib2-coverage, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS_grib2-coverages/1.0/req/grib2-coverage, with a single pertaining conformance class, grib2-coverage, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS_grib2-coverages/1.0/conf/grib2-coverage.







Standardization targets are coverage instance documents encoded in GRIB2.




Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site [1].




All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.

6. GRIB2 coverage representation requirements class



Requirements class grib2-coverage establishes how coverages are represented in the GRIB2 encoding format. The requirements class further specifies how coverages can be requested, such as from a WCS instance by defining the parameter for GRIB2 features compression. The identifying URL of grib2-coverage is given by http://www.opengis.net/spec/wcs/grib2/1.0/req/grib2-coverage.




6.1. General


The GRIB2 format allows not only the use of controlled vocabulary which are published by the WMO, but also variables defined only locally. The following admonition from the WMO’s Manual on Codes should be reiterated at this juncture:




“…​ the use of Local tables in messages intended for non-local or international exchange is strongly discouraged.”




In this sense, it is possible to encode GRIB2 messages using locally defined variables, but the likelihood that users will be able to interpret these messages is much lower than when the tables published by the WMO are used. If locally defined variables are used to exchange data, however, the tables required for reading the data should be supplied to users in an appropriate fashion.



	Requirement 1 
	http://www.opengis.net/spec/wcs/grib2/1.0/req/grib2-coverage/grib2-specification




A GRIB2 encoded coverage shall follow the GRIB2 specification [GRIB2].



	Requirement 2 
	/req/grib2-coverage/type




A GRIB2 encoded coverage shall be a concrete subclass of type cis:AbstractCoverage.






6.2. Domain

	Requirement 3 
	/req/grib2-coverage/crs




If the coverage instance under test is encoded in a multipart message and its first part consists of a GML document which is a concrete subclass of cis:AbstractCoverage, the coordinate reference system identified by the value of the srsName attribute of the gml:Envelope element of the gml:domainSet element of a GRIB2 encoded coverage shall be the same as the coordinate reference system used in the GRIB2. 




Note: The value of the srsName attribute of the Envelope element shall be inherited by all directly expressed geometries (see GML 3.2 [OGC 07-036] clause 9.10), i.e. for all range set values encoded in GRIB2.



	Requirement 4 
	/req/grib2-coverage/pixel-is-area




The domain of a GRIB2 encoded coverage shall respect the coverage’s raster space as defined in the GRIB2 specification [GRIB2], i.e. the grid point position described in code table 3.8 [2] of the GRIB2’s grid definition section.




Note: The definition of grids in GML 3.2 [OGC 07-036] clause 19.2.2 which CIS is based on reads: "When a grid point is used to represent a sample space (e.g. image pixel), the grid point represents the center of the sample space (see ISO 19123:2005, 8.2.2).”




Note: This requirement specifies that the gml:domainSet element shall respect the raster type i.e. it shall include the half pixel border in case of PixelIsArea (see also Figure 1) but not in case of PixelIsPoint. In other words, in case of PixelIsArea the gml:domainSet element is decreased by the half of both gml:offsetVector elements in the gml:lowerCorner coordinate compared to the case of PixelIsPoint. The gml:origin element stays the same independently of the raster space.




6.2.1. Examples


The following XML fragments show the domainSet and the domainSet elements describing the domain of sample coverages respecting the axis ordering of the used CRS:




	
Default axis order (northing, easting) using PixelIsArea:

<gml:upperCorner>70.5625 336.5625</gml:upperCorner>
</gml:Envelope>
</gml:boundedBy>

<gml:offsetVector srsName="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/3857">
0.0625 0.0625
</gml:offsetVector>
</gml:RectifiedGrid>
</gml:domainSet>






	
Default axis order (northing, easting) using PixelIsPoint:








<gml:boundedBy>
<gml:Envelope srsName="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326"

<gml:lowerCorner>29.4375 62.4375</gml:lowerCorner>
<gml:upperCorner>70.5625 336.5625</gml:upperCorner>
</gml:Envelope>
</gml:boundedBy>
<gml:domainSet>

... (same as above)

</gml:domainSet>






The simple figure below provides an explanation of the relation between raster or image space and model space in the case of PixelIsArea using the values from the examples above.

6.3. GRIB2 parameters


6.3.1. Request


The following GRIB2 parameters are defined for requesting GRIB2 encoded coverages, for example via WCS GetCoverage requests.




Note: It is always possible for a given coverage instance to determine its current parameter values, i.e., the parameter values used at creation. Thus, a GRIB2 encoded coverage is self-describing.



	Requirement 5 
	/req/grib2-coverage/parameters-xml




The structure of an XML request requesting a GRIB encoded coverage instance shall be extended as defined in Table 2 and the respective XML Schema being part of this standard.



	Requirement 6 
	/req/grib2-coverage/parameters-kvp




In a GET/KVP GetCoverage request, GRIB2-specific parameters shall adhere to the syntax and semantics defined in Table 2. 




Note: This prefix is used as namespace replacement in order to minimize the risk of reusing already defined KVP parameters.

	Validate the GRIB2 parameters present in the request if a KVP request was used to obtain the coverage instance under test.



Test passes if a KVP request was used to obtain the coverage instance under test and the GRIB2 parameters are valid according to Table 2 and the coverage instance is encoded as requested.

	Test type
	





A.10. Compression

	Test identifier
	/conf/grib2-coverage/compression

	Requirement
	/req/grib2-coverage/compression

	Dependency
	
	Test purpose
	The response to a successful request for a GRIB2 encoded coverage containing a compression GRIB2 parameter shall consist of a GRIB2 encoded coverage using the specified compression.

	Test method
	Check the GRIB2 parameters present in the request used to obtain the coverage instance under test for the presence of the compression parameter. If found and the parameter is valid, verify that the coverage instance is encoded using the requested compression.



Test passes if the compression parameter is present and the coverage instance is encoded as requested or if a HTTP 404 error code with the exceptionCode value CompressionNotSupported is returned.

	Test type
	





A.11. Exceptions

	Test identifier
	/conf/grib2-coverage/exceptions

	Requirement
	/req/grib2-coverage/exceptions

	Dependency
	
	Test purpose
	When a server or service encounters an error described in column "meaning of exception code" in Table 3, it shall return the corresponding exception report message with the contents of the locator parameter value as specified in the right column of Table 3.

	Test method
	Validate possible exception responses obtained instead of coverage instances when requesting GRIB2 encoded coverages using unsupported and invalid compression parameters.



Test passes if exceptions are using the relevant exceptionCode.

	Test type
