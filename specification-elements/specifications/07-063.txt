i. Preface 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international industry consortium of more 

than 320 companies, government agencies, and universities participating in a consensus 

process to develop publicly available geo-processing specifications. 

This profile started as an initiative funded by the British National Space Agency (BNSC) 

to define conventions for the Earth Observation (EO) community to use OGC Web 

Services.  The objective is to tightly define how OGC Web Service specifications can be 

applied by data providers to ensure that the inventory level visualisation of EO data is 

carried out in a truly interoperable way. 

ii. Document terms and definitions 

This document uses the specification terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 05-008], 

which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Rules for the structure and drafting of 

International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used 

to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this specification.

Introduction 

The WMS configuration proposed in this profile is intended to support the interactive 

visualization and evaluation of Earth Observation (EO) data products.  The profile sets 

out to describe a consistent Web Map Server (WMS) configuration that can be supported 

by many data providers (satellite operators, data distributors …), most of whom have 

existing (and relatively complex) facilities for the management of these data.  In addition, 

this profile is intended to compliment the OGC Catalogue Services Application Profile 

for EO products by showing how WMS servers may be used to evaluate products 

identified through catalogue discovery prior to their ordering.   

 

The target audience for this document includes Web map users, client developers, service 

implementers, and system testers.  The candidate specification encompasses two 

interrelated views that reflect different viewpoints on a Web map service.  Each 

viewpoint focuses on different areas of concern: 

 Enterprise – describes the general capabilities of the service in light of functional 
and nonfunctional requirements (for WMS users and system testers); 

 Information – defines the kinds of information handled by the catalogue and the 

policies to be enforced (for WMS users, developers and testers).

6 Overview and Context 

6.1 Background 

The acquisition of EO data is subject to a range of factors which effect the degree to 

which a product is fit for purpose.  For optical EO these factors include cloud cover, 

snow cover, atmospheric aerosols, low illumination angles, sun glint off the ocean or ice 

surface and suspended sediment in the water column.  For imaging radar the usefulness of 

products can be affected by wind speed, presence of surfactants and soil moisture.  It is 

therefore important to potential users that they can evaluate EO products prior to ordering 

and (where applicable) purchase. 

A number of WMS features make them a good choice for EO data providers wanting to 

open up their product inventories for evaluation: 

 open Web service specifications are widely and simply supported using common 
place Web browsers; 

 Web maps provide a geocoded view of data frequently acquired as ungeocoded 
scan lines; 

 the WMS interface supports roam and zoom functionality not available with a 
simple image thumbnail; 

 use of high levels of image compression reduces bandwidth requirements relative 
to WCS whilst allowing effective visual inspection; 

 the serving of products via highly compressed images ensures that the original 
data is protected from unauthorised use. 

Unfortunately, practical application of WMS technology is hindered by two issues: 

1. inconsistent interpretation of the WMS specification in the context of EO data; 

2. server instances are typically configured to return just a single representation 
using a sub-set of the dataset.  Some or even most, of the dataset is not made 

available for evaluation. 

To illustrate the first point, consider the use of WMS „layers‟.  A layer is defined as the 

basic unit of geographic information that may be requested as a map from a server.  A 

literal interpretation would be that each individual EO data granule (dataset) should be 

handled as a WMS layer.  With large inventories of EO products (>10,000) this results in 

bloated responses to GetCapability requests.  An alternative interpretation is that a WMS 

layer should represent a collection of datasets sharing the same product specification (i.e. 

a dataset series).  In this context, individual datasets can be retrieved and presented using 

their acquisition time.   

Whilst both interpretations can be justified, the resulting WMS server configurations are 

incompatible, seriously hindering the client to server and community wide 

interoperability.

6.2 Challenges 

6.2.1 Discovery 

EO data products are usually derived from an instrument onboard a satellite1 containing 

one or more sensors which typically acquire tens of thousands of products during their 

lifetime.  For a user, discovering an appropriate scene via a WMS can be challenging as 

even a well constrained search may return a number of overlapping scenes which obscure 

each other. 

6.2.2 Evaluation 

Using WMS technology to present EO datasets for evaluation is not straightforward.  

Data are frequently acquired by sensors simultaneously in several wavebands and/or 

polarizations of electromagnetic radiation (see Figure 6-1).  Higher level products may 

also contain coverage of bio/geophysical parameters derived from the original sample 

datasets.  Additional background and quality information are commonly stored as 

bitmasks which are critically important to evaluate the extent of usable data within a 

product coverage.  As a consequence, EO products often contain far more information 

than can easily be presented in a single, static RGB view. 
 

 
Figure 6-1: Example stack of data coverages in the sample dimension of an EO product. 

Note: Only a fraction of the sample information can be visualized using a static RGB image. 

                                                 

1 The same applies to Remote Sensing instruments used on airborne platforms

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Profile OGC 07-063 

The situation is even worse for the spatial metadata held in a parallel stack of bitmasks 

(see Figure 6-2) because the bitmask information cannot be added to a static RGB image 

without obscuring data and other bitmask information. 

 

Figure 6-2: Example spatial metadata (bitmask) stack from an EO instrument. 

Meeting the twin challenges of true interoperability and the full evaluation of the spatial 

elements of EO products (interactive browse), requires the definition of a consistent, 

constrained, interpretation of the WMS specification.  This task is carried out in Section 

7.

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Profile OGC 07-063 

7 Constraints and Conventions of WMS Usage for EO Products 

7.1 Approach 

The definition of a consistent, constrained, interpretation of the WMS specification has 

two aspects: 

1. a WMS metadata model of the spatial data and metadata structure of EO datasets; 

2. a defined set of WMS server responses to GetMap requests.   

These aspects are, respectively, addressed in sub-sections 7.2 and 7.3. 

Mandatory constructs and behaviour are defined to provide a simple WMS profile that 

will allow for basic (default) representation of EO products in an interoperable way.  

Additional, optional, elements of the metadata model and WMS server behaviour are 

defined to cater for the full interactive browse and evaluation of EO products.  

7.2 Metadata Model 

The metadata model provides the basic framework, the skeleton, of a WMS instance.  

Defining a WMS metadata model for EO products is therefore a prerequisite for an 

application profile that is unambiguous whilst allowing interactive viewing of all of the 

spatial information within EO products.  Figure 7-1 provides a view of how the normal 

arrangement of EO products can be mirrored using appropriate WMS metadata elements 

and attributes.  

 
Figure 7-1: UML class diagrams showing how the organisation of EO spatial information 

maps to the proposed WMS service metadata model.   

 Note the use of multiplicity on the class associations.

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Profile OGC 07-063 

The handling of service metadata for EO products defined here is in line with Annex C 

(Handling multi-dimensional data) of the WMS 1.3 implementation specification (OGC 

06-042).  The overview for the WMS 1.3 handling of multi-dimensional data concludes: 

“The server may declare a single name for the layer and enumerate available times and 
wavelength bands in its service metadata. A client then adds additional parameters to 

the GetMap request to request a specific time and band.” 

7.2.1 Mandatory service metadata 

For EO datasets a LAYER service metadata element shall be used to represent each 

dataset series / dataset type.  For instance, all products of type „MERIS instrument, Level 

1b, Reduced Resolution‟ would be described as a dataset series and represented by a 

single LAYER element in the service metadata of a WMS instance.   

EO WMS instances shall support default maps of a given dataset series.  The default 

image map shall be defined as the mandatory dataset series LAYER e.g.: 

<Layer> 

<Name>"MER_RR__2P"</Name> 

… 

</Layer> 

The service metadata shall define a TIME dimension for each LAYER element, e.g.: 

<Dimension name="time" units="ISO8601"> 

2002-05-01/2006-09-17/PT100.6M 

</Dimension> 

The use of the mandatory TIME dimension to retrieve maps from individual EO products 

is defined in sub-section 7.3.1. 

The use of other service metadata (sample dimensions and nested layers) in the dataset 

series LAYER is optional and should be used to support interactive browse of EO 

products. 

7.2.2 Coverage outline service metadata 

To support the discovery of EO products an optional layer may be used to provide 

outlines of EO product bounding boxes (see Figure 7-2 for example).  If such a layer is 

used then it shall be nested within the dataset series LAYER.  When used, a sub-layer of 

products outlines shall be queryable to distinguish it from other nested sub-layers e.g.: 

<Layer queryable="1"> 

<Name>"MER_RR__2P"</Name> 

… 

</Layer> 

Note that the product outlines layer, when used, shall support a GetFeatureInfo request in 

order to return information on any EO products who‟s bounding box encloses the 

geographic location selected by the user.  The outlines LAYER element shall also contain 

a STYLE element listing the following 10 predefined colours: 

<Styles=white,yellow,orange,red,magenta,blue,cyan,green,brown,black>

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Profile OGC 07-063 

 

Figure 7-2: Screen shot illustrating the use of an ‘outline’ layer to avoid the obscuration caused by 

overlapping images of EO products. 

7.2.3 Band coverage service metadata 

Band coverage datasets refer to a series of coverage datasets that have common type of 

measurement such as wavelength or polarisation.   

If an EO WMS instance supports the interactive selection and viewing of band coverage 

datasets within a given dataset series then a WMS sample dimension shall be defined in 

the service metadata of the associated LAYER element.  For instance, consider a WMS 

instance that supports interactive browsing of a series of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture 

Radar datasets.  The sample dimension within the LAYER element of the dataset series 

might be defined as: 

<Dimension name="polarization_(intensity)" units="" multipleValues=”1”> 

HH, VV, HV, VH 

</Dimension> 

Similarly, datasets from a passive sensor that detects upwelling radiance in a number of 

wavebands might be defined as: 

<Dimension name="wavelength" units="nano metres" unitSymbol="nm" 

multipleValues=”1”> 

412.5, 442.5, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665 

</Dimension> 

7.2.4 Geophysical parameter service metadata 

Geophysical parameter datasets differ from band datasets in that each coverage has a 

distinct unit of measure.  Geophysical parameter datasets are typically displayed in 

pseudo-colour with a colour key relating parameter values to image colour (see Figure 

7.3).

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Profile OGC 07-063 

 

 
Figure 7-3: Example geophysical parameter map, in pseudo-colour with associated colour legend.   

To support interactive browse, the service metadata shall define each of geophysical 

parameter as a LAYER nested in the main dataset series (data-type) LAYER.  Geophysical 

parameter layers shall be distinguished by the presence of an associated style containing a 

LegendURL element whose value shall link to a graphical colour key. 

7.2.5 Spatial metadataset (bitmask) service metadata 

Subtle variations in values across coverage datasets can be presented as greyscale or 

colour image maps in a number of ways (see Section 7.3.2), often through Red Green 

Blue (RGB) colour combination.  Bitmasks, however, represent spatial metadata flags 

that are either „on‟ or „off‟.  As such, it is more appropriate to present bitmasks in the 

spatial metadataset stack of an EO product in single colour maps that hide the underlying 

map of coverage datasets as shown in Figure 7-4 below.  For consistency, a predefined 

set of colours need to be defined for use to generate bitmask maps. 

Figure 7-4: Application of four bitmasks to an EO dataset coverage false colour composite map.  

Note that four contrasting colours have been chosen to represent the bitmasks. 

Sample dimensions cannot be used to represent the bitmask stack as the assignment / 

reassignment of colours to sample dimensions is not supported in the WMS 1.3

Candidate OpenGIS® WMS 1.3 Application Profile OGC 07-063 

implementation specification.  To provide the required degree of flexibility, each bitmask 

shall be represented as a nested LAYER element (see Figure 7-1).  Each bitmask LAYER 

shall in turn contain a STYLE element listing the following 10 predefined colours: 

<Styles=white,yellow,orange,red,magenta,blue,cyan,green,brown,black> 

7.3 GetMap Request/Response 

Where the service metadata model provides the skeleton for this WMS profile, the 

definition of the GetMap request/response adds the functional muscle that ultimately 

delivers the rendered image maps back to a user‟s client application.  The default 

behaviour needed to support consistent WMS handling for EO products is defined in sub-

section 7.3.1.  The behaviour needed to support interactive browse and evaluation of EO 

products is defined in sub-sections 7.3.2, 7.3.3 and 7.3.4. 

7.3.1 Presentation of default coverage maps 

This sub-section covers the client – server handling of the mandatory service elements 

without reference to specific coverage dataset or spatial metadataset elements.  Sub-

section 7.2.1 defined the use of LAYER elements to identify dataset series with the TIME 

dimension used to identify individual EO products.  An example GetMap request is given 

below with the principle parts of the request shown in bold.  

http://eoltd.co.uk/mapserver.cgi?VERSION=1.3.0 

 &REQUEST=GetMap&CRS=CRS:84  

 &BBOX=78.105,24.913,94.794,36.358  

 &WIDTH=560&HEIGHT=350  

 &LAYERS=MER_RR__2P&STYLES=&FORMAT=image/png 

 &TIME=2002-07-30/2002-07-31/P1D 

When no coverage dataset sample dimensions or bitmask sub-layers are defined in the 

GetMap request then the WMS server shall respond by returning a default map of the 

requested EO product(s), as shown in Figure 7-5 below.

7.3.2 Presentation of band coverage maps 

The type of rendering of band datasets carried out by the WMS server for shall depend on 

the number of sample dimension values requested.  Only one or three sample dimension 

values may be specified per GetMap request.  If any other number of sample dimension 

values is requested then the server shall issue a service exception (code = 

InvalidDimensionValue). 

A GetMap request for a single dataset in the sample dimension shall be served by either a 

greyscale image as illustrated in Figure 7-6.

dimension dataset with a SAR intensity map returned as a greyscale image. 

A GetMap request for three sample dimension datasets shall be served by a false colour 

composite with each of the datasets contrast stretched (see Figure 7-7 for examples).

7.3.3 Presentation of geopysical parameter coverage maps 

A GetMap request for a geophysical parameter LAYER nested in the sample dimension 

shall be served as a pseudo colour image with a colour legend (see Figure 7-3 for 

example). 

7.3.4 Presentation of metadataset coverage (bitmask) maps 

As noted in Section 7.2.5, the spatial metadataset (bitmask) stacks are defined using 

layers nested within each dataset series layer.  This nesting should be reflected in the 

name of each nested bitmask layer by using the parent layer name to prefix the nested 

bitmask layer names.  For instance, the bitmask CLOUD within the dataset series 

MER_RR__2P would have the layer name MER_RR__2P_CLOUD.   

An example GetMap request is given below: 

http://eoltd.co.uk/mapserver.cgi?VERSION=1.3.0 

 &REQUEST=GetMap&CRS=CRS:84  

 &BBOX=78.105,24.913,94.794,36.358  

 &WIDTH=560&HEIGHT=350  

 &LAYERS=MER_RR__2P, 

 MER_RR__2P_CLOUD, 

 MER_RR__2P_ABSOA_DUST, 

 MER_RR__2P_ICE_HAZE, 

 MER_RR__2P_SUSPECT 

 &STYLES=,CYAN,ORANGE,MAGENTA,GREEN 

 &FORMAT=image/png  

 &TIME=2005-10-05 07:25:00 

Note that the parent dataset series layer is listed with the bitmask layers and that the 

corresponding styles list has a blank (default) entry for the parent dataset series layer.
