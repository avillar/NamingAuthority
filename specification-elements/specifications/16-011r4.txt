i. Abstract 
Volume 8 of the CDB standard defines the conceptual model and the methodologies that 
allow the description, and transformation or conversion, of geometric properties within a 
set of spatial reference frames supported by the CDB standard. The CDB Spatial 
Reference Model (SRM) supports an unambiguous specification of the positions, 
directions, and distances associated with spatial information. This document also defines 
algorithms for precise transformation of positions, directions and distances among 
different spatial reference frames.

1. Scope 

The handling of spatial data requires a good deal of rigor to accurately describe the 
position of points in space.  Furthermore, it requires the ability to define directions and 
distances.  Generally, this is accomplished through the use of coordinate systems. 

A coordinate system (also called a spatial reference system) is a means of assigning 
coordinates to a location and establishing relationships between sets of such coordinates. 



6 
Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

Specifying a coordinate reference system enables the interpretation of a set of coordinates 
as a representation of a position in a real world space. 

In the CDB standard, these terms can be used interchangeably. However, for consistency 
with previous versions of the CDB standard, the term spatial reference system (SRS) is 
used. 

There is often the requirement to represent position in several different spatial reference 
systems.  Each spatial reference system provides a particular way of defining positions 
within its domain.  This level of abstraction also permits spatial reference systems to be 
decomposed into a series of, or even a hierarchy of reference, each relative to another 
reference system.  This mechanism permits objects to be independently defined 
(positioned, oriented, and scaled) with respect to a local SRS and then be later 
incorporated into other reference systems.  The reference systems can be abstract 
mathematical constructs or they can be bound to real world objects (e.g., a flap located 
defined in a flap reference system which in turn is bound to an aircraft wing reference 
system).

6. CDB Approach 

One of the primary objectives of the CDB standard is to provide the means to represent 
the entire earth.  As such, a CDB compliant data store must handle spatial data with a 
good deal of rigor to accurately describe the position of points in space and must do so at 
the level of fidelity commensurate with the precision that is now possible in modern 
simulators. 

The size, content, fidelity and precision of synthetic environments now warrant a 
different approach, an approach that entirely avoids the “problem with projections” and 
other approximations used in the past.  To this end, the CDB standard mandates the use a 
geographic coordinate system (GCS). A GCS uses a three-dimensional spherical 
surface to define locations on the earth. Since no projections are involved, full geometric 
coherence is assured without compromise and all four key spatial properties can be 
achieved simultaneously: 

(1) Preservation of distance 
(2) Preservation of direction 
(3) Preservation of area 
(4) Preservation of shape 

6.1 CDB Spatial Reference Systems 
The CDB standard is based on a surface geodetic coordinate system, i.e., points on the 
earth surface are specified as geographic latitude -longitude and elevation coordinates. 
More specifically, geodetic coordinates (sometimes called geographic coordinates) are 
angular coordinates (longitude and latitude), closely related to spherical polar 
coordinates, and are defined relative to a particular Earth geodetic datum. For the CDB, 
this is the WGS 84 datum. The WGS 84 datum surface is an oblate spheroid (ellipsoid) 
with major (equatorial) radius a = 6378137 m at the equator and flattening f = 
1/298.257223563.[6] The polar semi-minor axis b then equals a times (1−f), or 
6356752.3142 m.

Copyright © 2018 Open Geospatial Consortium 

The CDB data store embeds modeled point features (e.g., the representation of 3-D 
objects, moving and/or static) within a Cartesian Coordinate System1.  Its use is generally 
constrained to objects that are small in comparison to the earth.  As shown below, a 
modeled point feature can be referenced anywhere on the earth by providing the model’s 
orientation (the AO1 attribute specified in Chapter 5 of Volume 1: OGC CDB Core 
Standard: Model and Physical Database Structure) and the model’s origin using a set of 
latitude/longitude/elevation coordinates.  Note that the model’s z-axis implicitly points 
upward with respect to the earth surface. 

 
Figure 1: Cartesian Model positioned to WGS-84 Coordinates 

The earth shape is described by the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid.  The CDB standard also 
defines three related set of Spatial Reference Systems (and associated coordinate 
systems) for use in conjunction with the surface geodetic coordinate system; they are: 

(1) Earth-centered Cartesian (Geocentric) 
(2) Generic Cartesian 
(3) Local Vertical (LVCS) 

7. The Three Systems 

The following sections detail the normative aspects of the three Spatial Reference 
Systems (SRS) supported in the CDB model. We start with a general discussion of the 
Geographical Coordinate System before addressing the Spatial Reference Systems. 

                                                
1 . A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point 
uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to 
the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length

7.1 Geographic Coordinate System (Geodetic) 
A geographic coordinate system (also called the geodetic coordinate system) is one in 
which the coordinates are expressed as latitude, longitude, and altitude relative to the 
reference ellipsoid. Geographical latitude f and longitude l are the angles of the normal 
on the reference ellipsoid along the point to the equator and zero meridian. The angles are 
normally given as degrees, minutes and seconds.  Altitude is the distance above and 
normal to the reference ellipsoid in meters.  The WGS 84 ellipsoid represents the actual 
geoid within an accuracy of 100 meters.  The prime meridian and the equator are the 
reference planes used to define latitude and longitude. 

In other terms, the geographic latitude – there are many other defined latitudes – of a 
point is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line normal to the reference 
ellipsoid’s surface.  The geographic longitude of a point is the angle between a reference 
plane, Greenwich, and a plane passing through the point, both planes being perpendicular 
to the equatorial plane.  The geographic height at a point is the distance from the 
reference ellipsoid to the point in a direction normal to the reference ellipsoid.

Notes 

(1) The CS surface is the oblate ellipsoid (or sphere) 
surface excluding the pole points. 

(2) The geodetic 3D CS induces this CS on the 3rd 
coordinate surface at any point for which h = 0. 

(3) If a = b, the geodetic latitude f  coincides with the 
spherical latitude q. 

(4) For WGS-84 a= 6,378,137 m and b = 6,356,752 m.  
The inverse flattening ratio f-1 is 298.257223563. 

 

7.1.1 Earth-Centered SRS (aka Rectangular Geocentric SRS) 
The earth-centered SRS defines a three-dimensional Euclidian space with respect to the 
geometric center of the reference ellipsoid, the center of the earth.  The reference datum 
of the Earth-centered SRS is based on the WGS-84 ellipsoid reference model.  In this 
SRS, the z-axis is pointing at the North Pole, the x-axis is pointing at the intersection of 
the equator and the Greenwich meridian, the prime meridian, and the y-axis is pointing at 
the intersection of the equator and 90o east longitude.  The associated coordinate system 
is called the World Coordinate System and its units are meters.  The world coordinate 
system is used to specify the 3D position of objects with respect to the earth-centered 
SRS.  This coordinate system is used as an intermediate system to convert geodetic 
coordinates to LVCS and vice versa 

7.1.2 General Cartesian SRS 
The Cartesian spatial reference frame defines a three-dimensional Euclidian space with 
respect to an arbitrary origin.  The reference datum specifying the origin and the 
orientation of the SRS is arbitrary, i.e. the reference datum can be specified within a 
geocentric SRS, a LVCS SRS or any other SRS.  The SRS is right-handed and 
orthonormal.  In this SRS system, the z-axis is pointing up and both the x-axis and y-axis 
lie in the horizontal plane.  The associated coordinate system is called the General 
Cartesian Coordinate System; coordinates are specified in meters.  This coordinate 
system is used for the representation of 3-D objects, moving and/or static.  Its use is 
generally constrained to objects that are small in comparison to the earth2. 

7.1.3 Local Vertical SRS 
The Local Vertical SRS (LVCS) spatial reference frame defines a three-dimensional 
Euclidian space.  It is a SRF similar to the Geocentric SRF except that the origin of the 
SRF is translated and rotated to a point on the surface of the WGS-84 ellipsoid.  At that 
point, the x-y plane is tangent to the surface of the earth and the z-axis is normal to the 
ellipsoid.  The associated coordinate system is called the local vertical coordinate system; 
the coordinates are specified in meters.  In this coordinate system, the z-axis is pointing

up, the y-axis is pointing north and the x-axis is pointing east.  Its use is generally 
constrained to a surface that is small in comparison to the earth3. 

7.2 Geodetic to Geocentric transformation4 
The following equations are used to transform geodetic information to geocentric information 
according to the following: 

(1) If <j, l, h> represents the geodetic coordinates to be transformed, 
where j is the latitude, l is the longitude, and h is the WGS84 height 
above the reference ellipsoid; and 

 

(2) If <x, y, z> represents the geocentric coordinates; then using the 
WGS84 ellipsoid equatorial radius, a, of 6,378,137.0m and the 
WGS84 ellipsoid polar radius, b, of 6,356,752.314245m, the flattening 
f, the eccentricity e and the radius of curvature as a function of latitude 
N(j) are given by equation eq. A-1: 

 

 

 

 

(eq. A-1) 

 

 

From these equations, we define the transformation of each geodetic coordinate as: 

 

 

 

 

(eq. A-2)

7.3 Geocentric to Geodetic Transformation 
Geocentric coordinates cannot be transformed to the geodetic coordinate system directly.  
Instead, a successive approximation approach is used to compute the new coordinates.  
The following describes the algorithm to convert geocentric coordinates <x, y, z> to 
geodetic coordinates <j, l, h>, where j is the latitude, l is the longitude, and h is the 
WGS84 height above the reference ellipsoid.  First, using the WGS84 ellipsoid equatorial 
radius, a = 6,378,137.0 m and the WGS84 ellipsoid polar radius, b = 6,356,752.314245 
m, the flattening f and the eccentricity e of the ellipsoid are given by equation A-3: 

 

 

 
(eq. A-3) 

 

We first compute the longitude l with equation A-4: 

 

 (eq. A-4) 

 

We then compute a first approximation of the latitude assuming a spherical earth model 
with equation A-5: 

 

 (eq. A-5) 

 

Then, we iteratively compute the radius of curvature as a function of latitude N(j) and, as 
a result we iteratively converge to a new, more accurate latitude j’ with equation A-6:

For each iteration, jj is replaced with j’, until the difference between the two values is 
less than a preset allowable error.  The resulting latitude error will be less than ee.  Finally, 
we compute the height above the reference ellipsoid h with equation A-7 

 

 (eq. A-7) 

 

7.4 Geodetic to LVCS Coordinate Transformation 
The transformation of a geodetic coordinate into an LVCS coordinate is decomposed into 
two parts: 

1. Apply a coordinate transformation to each coordinate of an object 
from the geodetic coordinate system to the rectangular geocentric 
coordinate system. 

2. Then apply a second transformation to go from the geocentric 
coordinate system to LVCS. 

 
The first transformation, from geodetic to rectangular geocentric is described in section 
Error! Reference source not found..  The transformation is applied to the origin of the 
object.  The result of this transformation is the origin x0 of the object in the geocentric 
coordinate system.  Then for each coordinate x of the object, we apply the geodetic to 
geocentric transformation to coordinate x and we then compute the translation vector t 
between x and x0 in the geocentric coordinate system with equation A-8 

 (eq. A-8) 

  

The second transformation, from geocentric to LVCS is presented here as an algorithm to 
transform all coordinates of an object from the geodetic coordinate system to LVCS.  The 
transformation from geodetic to LVCS first requires the assembly of a 3x3 rotation 
matrix M with equation A-9:

Where: j0 and l0 = the latitude and longitude of the origin of the object. 

Finally, the rotation matrix M is applied to the translation vector t to obtain each 
coordinate xL in the local vertical coordinate system with equation A-10:

The DIS coordinate system is used on a HLA network and is represented on the 
following figure. 

 

 
Figure 2: DIS Entity5 Coordinate System 

The two coordinate systems differ in the axis conventions (Z is up in the CDB while Z is 
down in DIS).  Furthermore, the position of the origin also differs; DIS requires that the 
origin of its coordinate system be located at the center of the entity’s bounding box 
excluding its articulated and attached parts6.  The CDB standard uses a different 
convention. 

The transformation from the CDB coordinate system to the DIS coordinate system 
involves one translation followed by two rotations.  The translation represents the offset 
to the DIS origin as defined in chapter 6.  Assume that P0 represents the coordinate of the 
DIS origin. 

 (eq. A-11) 

 

The two rotations are relatively simple.  First, rotate 180° about the X-axis.  This rotation 
will position the Z-axis in its correct position.  Equation A-12 represents this rotation. 

 

                                                
5  DIS refers to a 3D model as an entity. 

6  This definition can be found on page 3 of IEEE Std 1278.1-1995.  Note that the CDB provides the means to store 
the DIS origin within the coordinate system space of the model.

 (eq. A-12) 

 

Second, rotate -90° about this new Z-axis.  This last rotation completes the 
transformation and is represented by equation A-13. 

 

 (eq. A-13) 

 

Now, if we combine equations A-11, A-12 and A-13, we can transform a point P 
expressed in the CDB coordinate system into point P’ in the DIS coordinate system.  
Equation A-14 presents the complete transformation. 

 (eq. A-14) 

 

The combined matrix gives equation A-15 and the resulting individual terms are 
presented in A-16.

 (eq. A-16) 

 

If a single transformation matrix M is preferred then Matrix Mzx and point P0 are 
combined to obtain the set of equations A-17.

(eq. A-17) 

 

To convert from the DIS coordinate system back to the CDB coordinate system, the 
inverse transformation is applied.  Knowing that unscaled rotation matrices (the upper 3 x 
3 portion of M) have the property that their inverse is their transpose, we obtain the set of 
equations A-18.
