		Use one of the following categories:
F  (Critical correction)

B  (Addition of feature), 
C  (Functional modification of feature)
D  (Editorial modification)


Detailed explanations of the above categories can
be found in the TC Policies and Procedures.

		



		

		



		Reason for change:
(


		A GML 3.2 binding of the O&M schemas is required for applications that wish to use the current version of GML 3.2. It is also necessary to underpin an orderly revision process for O&M, in which implementation specifics are handled separately from functional changes.

How to create CRs using this form:


Comprehensive information and tips about how to create CRs can be found at: https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=10678.  Below is a brief summary:


Fill out the above form. The symbols above marked ( contain pop-up help information about the field that they are closest to.


Obtain the latest version for the release of the specification to which the change is proposed. Use the MS Word "revision marks" feature (also known as "track changes") when making the changes. All Open GIS specifications can be downloaded from the OGC server under http://www.opengeospatial.org/specs/ 


If a Word version of the document is not available, please contact the TCC or his designee.


With "track changes" disabled, paste the entire CR form (use CTRL-A to select it) into the specification just in front of the clause containing the first piece of changed text.  Delete those parts of the specification that are not relevant to the change request.

			 Base type for Observations. 
            Observation is an act ("event"), whose result is an estimate of the value of a property of the feature of interest. 
            The observed property may be any property associated with the type of the feature of interest.

			    The following properties are inherited from AbstractFeatureType:
				
				
			
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
					 
						 
							 The samplingTime is the time that the result applies to the feature-of-interest. 
					This is the time usually required for geospatial analysis of the result.
						
					
					 
						 
							 The resultTime is the time when the procedure associated with the observation act was applied. 
					For some observations this is identical to samplingTime, in which case the resultTime may be omitted. 
					
					Example: 	Where a measurement is made on a specimen in a laboratory, the samplingTime should record the time the specimen was retrieved from its host, while the resultTime should record the time the laboratory procedure was applied. 
					Example: 	Where sensor observation results are post-processed, the resultTime is the post-processing time, while the samplingTime preserves the time of initial interaction with the world. 
					Example: 	Simulations are often used to estimate the values for phenomena in the future or past. The samplingTime is the real-world time that the result applies to, while the resultTime is the time that the simulation process was executed.
						
					
					 
						 
							 The procedure is the description of a process used to generate the result. 
							It must be suitable for the observed property. 
							NOTE: 	At this level we do not distinguish between sensor-observations, 
							estimations made by an observer, or algorithms, simulations, computations and complex processing chains.
						
					
					 
					 
						 
							 Property-type or phenomenon for which the observation result provides an estimate of its value. 
							for example "wavelength", "grass-species", "power", "intensity in the waveband x-y", etc. 
							It must be a property associated with the type of the feature of interest. 
							This feature-property that provides the (semantic) type of the observation. 
							The description of the phenomenon may be quite specific and constrained. 

							The description of the property-type may be presented using various alternative encodings. 
							If shown inline, the swe:Phenomenon schema is required. 
							If provided using another encoding (e.g. OWL or SWEET) then the description must be in a remote repository and xlink reference used.
						
					
					 
						 
							 The featureOfInterest is a feature of any type (ISO 19109, ISO 19101), which is a representation of the observation target, being the real-world object regarding which the observation is made. 
							such as a specimen, station, tract, mountain, pixel, etc. 
							The spatial properties (location) of this feature of interest are typically of most interest for spatial analysis of the observation result.
						
					
					 
						 
							 An Observation parameter is a general event-specific parameter. 
							This will typically be used to record environmental parameters, or event-specific sampling parameters that are not tightly bound to either the feature-of-interest or the procedure. 
							NOTE: 	Parameters that are tightly bound to the procedure should be recorded as part of the procedure description. For example, the SensorML model associates parameters with specific process elements or stages. 
							NOTE: 	The semantics of the parameter must be provided as part of its value. 
							
							In some applications it is convenient to use a generic or standard procedure, or feature-of-interest, rather than define an event-specific process or feature. 
							In this context, event-specific parameters are bound to the Observation act.
						
					
					 
						 
							 The result contains the value generated by the procedure. 
							The type of the observation result must be consistent with the observed property, and the scale or scope for the value must be consistent with the quantity or category type. 
							Application profiles may choose to constrain the type of the result.
						
					
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Observation is an act ("event"), whose result is an estimate of the value of a property of the feature of interest. 
            The observed property may be any property associated with the type of the feature of interest.
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 
		
		 
	
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 Collection of arbitrary observations
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
				
			
		
	
	
	 
		 
			 Collection of arbitrary observations
		
	
	
	
	 
		 
			 This property type allows the Observation/procedure property to  either 
		* contain a SensorML Process, 
		* contain a description of a process described using another model, wrapped inside a om:Process element
		* point to a Process either elsewhere in the document or identified by a URI
		
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 Top of  SensorML Process hierarchy
					
				
				 
					 
						 This element is xs:anyType so may contain a description of a process provided in any well-formed XML. 
				If the process description is namespace qualified, then the namespace must be identified in the instance document.
