v. Future work 

A description of Web Map Context is necessary within the Section 4.3, OGC Web 
Services for the NSG.  Ideally this material would be placed in to a new sub-section, 
4.3.3. 

It would be useful to include a discussion of how DoD Information Technology 
Standards and Profile Registry are represented within this profile.  This work would 
provide use cases and DoDAF views and should fit into Section 4.1.1. 

The initial sponsors of this document have requested that this work include a mapping of 
NSG Data Sources, or NGA Products, to OWS services and profiles.  This information 
should be included in Section 4.1.2. 

This document was originally intended to provide a section describing the Creating 
Features from Observations, Section 4.5.4.  Resource limitations prevented this work 
from being done.  The relevant NGA excerpt and applicable OGC specifications are 
shown below.  This work should be provided as resource become available. 

Information Management.  Today, the best NSG information is not always 
generated, visible or accessible to customers.  This is a result of information 
management processes that occur independently, serve limited customer sets, and 
are not routinely understood by or available to customers.  The NSG will evolve 
from a product-oriented environment to a knowledge-centric enterprise, 
with an information management architecture to support the new paradigm.  
An integrated information environment and a service-oriented architecture, with 
data-centric, networked capabilities, will provide assured customer access to 
GEOINT data, products, and services.  It will provide discovery, acquisition,

Foreword 

The National Center for Geospatial Intelligence Standards (NCGIS) of the National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is participating in the Open Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC) Interoperability Program Open Web Services activity, Phase 4 
(OWS-4). NGA/NCGIS is undertaking this activity in support of one of the 
modernization goals for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG). This 
goal is to increase NGA’s capabilities to leverage existing market driven Standards–
based Commercial Off-The-Shelf (SCOTS) solutions for fulfilling analyst’s needs in 
undertaking their missions. Part of NCGIS’ mission is to ensure that commercial industry 
addresses NGA interoperable technology requirements.   

The NCGIS, through efforts such as the OGC’s Interoperability Program, works to ensure 
standards and standards-based commercial software developments are accelerated. The 
goal is for these standards and software elements, addressing NSG requirements, to be 
ready for implementation when the GeoScout contractor begins that phase of 
modernization of NGA’s information technology (IT) infrastructure.  As a part of the 
OWS-4 effort, OGC has developed this OGC Web Services Architectural Profile for the 
NSG to encourage industry vendors to develop, test and validate interface specifications. 
These interface specifications are anticipated to lead to commercial products suitable for 
use by NGA, its customers, and the broader federal geospatial community.

Executive summary 

The purpose of this document is to generally describe how the various OGC 
specifications may be used to address the needs of a large enterprise system.  It highlights 
the key elements of the OWS-4 effort as they relate to web service architecture 
implementation at NGA and in the NSG.  The goal is that this document will enable 
organization that interface with the NSG to understand how to produce and consume data 
and services in an interoperable environment.   

The document includes description of all applicable OGC specification, the relationship 
of theses specifications to NSG concepts, the relationship of these specifications to each 
other and architectural concepts related to the application of these specifications.   
Foundational concepts such as net-centric and service oriented architecture are presented.  
This is followed by a discussion of service models, information models, OWS-4 results 
and other OGC topics which are applicable to the NSG.  

The technologies discussed as part of this profile include: 

• OGC Service Framework 
• OGC Web Services (WMS, WFS, WCS) 
• Catalog (CS-W) 
• Geospatial Digital Rights Management (GeoDRM) 
• Sensor Web Enablement (SPS, SOS, SAS, WNS, SensorML, TransducerML) 
• Geo-Processing Workflow 
• Geo-Decision Support Services (GeoDSS) 
• Compliance Testing 

 

It is expected that the vendor community’s support for these specifications will continue 
to increase, and this document will act as a guide for the NGS, NSG connected 
organizations and the broader federal geospatial community.  This document is intended 
to complement other documents such as the Spatial Data Infrastructure 1.0 (SDI) in that it 
provides a comprehensive description of OGC specifications, a context of how they apply 
to the NSG domain and a description of how the specifications can be assembled to meet 
the needs of an enterprise. 

OWS Implementation Profile includes the following elements:

1 Scope 

OGC specifications capture general purpose capabilities independent of any particular 
operational environment.  For many organizations, however, these general capabilities 
are not sufficient.  Additional documentation is required to provide developers the 
guidance they need to apply OGC specifications and design patterns within their specific 
operational context.  OGC Implementation Profiles provide that guidance.       

This OGC Document defines an Implementation Profile of the OGC Web Services for 
use by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in the National System for 
Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). 

This document is developed as part of the OGC Web Services, Phase 4 (OWS-4) 
Interoperability Initiative. 

This document will be offered for consideration as a Best Practice Document by the OGC 
Specification Program.

Figure 1 shows some of the major OWS-4 work areas and how they relate to each other 
in an operational context.  These work areas are: 

• 

• 

Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) - addresses the creation of sensor networks including 
services for tasking, processing and notification.  The objective of SWE is to make 
measurements from any sensor readily available for exploitation. 

Geo-Processing Workflow (GPW) - addresses the interoperable processing of 
geospatial data.  This includes traditional cartographic data as well as other positional 
data types such as sensor measurements and observations.  Since most information 
has a location element, GPW represents the suite of services and data standards for 
integrating and processing almost any data source.

• 

Geospatial Decision Support Services (GeoDSS) - addresses the tools and 
applications used to implement the decision support process. 

Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Building Information Model (BIM) - The data 
sets used to design, build and maintain a building have strong similarities to 
geospatial data.  An on-going CAD/GIS effort is working to integrate these two 
communities into an interoperable information framework.  This will greatly expand 
the information available to the decision support analyst.    

Subsequent sections of this document will explore these efforts and show their 
application to NSG objectives. 

5.2 Foundation concepts 

5.2.1 Requirements on OGC technologies  

This section focuses on identifying key requirements on OGC technologies. Before 
listing these requirements, it is important to note that OGC technologies are not limited to 
the specifications formalized by the consortium; they also include working 
implementations of such specifications. As such, in order to support the geospatial 
information value chain, OGC technologies must:  

- Be agile so as to be able to adapt to changing business rules and operational 
requirements;   

- Support the easy and seamless introduction of new technologies and the evolution of 
existing ones;  

- Provide for robustness and consistent error handling and recovery to support mission-
critical systems development;  

- Accommodate authentication, security and privacy features and support asset 
protection;  

- Be platform independent (e.g., DCP, hardware, OS, programming language, encodings, 
etc);  

- Support implementations of N-tiered, component architectures;  

- Support standard interfaces and metadata while accommodating the use of other 
complementary standards and specifications in environments where OpenGIS 
specifications are implemented;  
 
- Support interoperability by specifying interface definitions, service descriptions and 
protocols for software collaboration and negotiation;  
 
- OGC and ISO TC211 have an agreement to sustain the technical alignment of their 
respective developments.  OGC also maintains contact with a number of other standards

OGC 07-009r3 

organizations (W3C, IETF, OMG, AMIC and others), generally offering expertise related 
to spatial issues and receiving expertise necessary to ensure that OGC's standards 
framework is consistent with other IT standards frameworks. 
 
- Accommodate independently developed implementations of a service and many 
independently provided instantiations of different types of services;  
 
- Accommodate a wide range of data policies (e.g., data access and data use policies);  
 
- Be vendor and data neutral;  
 
- Be data content format independent.  
 
5.2.2 Services, interfaces and operations 

Key definitions for the Service Framework are:  

- A Service as a distinct part of the functionality that is provided by an entity through 
interfaces,  

- An Interface as a named set of operations that characterize the behavior of an entity,  

- An Operation as a specification of a transformation or query that an object may be 
called to execute. Each operation has a name and a list of parameters.  

 

 

Figure 2 - Service definition relationships 

A service may be expressed at various levels of granularity. A coarse-grained 
collaboration may be refined to produce a service that has a finer granularity. This is

OGC 07-009r3 

accomplished by expanding one or more operations from a high level collaboration into 
distinct lower level services, one for each operation.  

An instance of a service may be associated with a specific instance of a dataset, or it may 
be a service that can be used to operate on multiple, unspecified datasets. The first case is 
referred to as a tightly coupled data and service. The second case is referred to as 
loosely coupled service. Service operations can be associated with data classes (data 
type) or with instances (data set).  

5.2.3 OWS service framework 

The OWS Service Framework (OSF) identifies services, interfaces and exchange 
protocols that can be utilized by any application. OpenGIS Services are implementations 
of services that conform to OpenGIS Implementation Specifications. Compliant 
applications, called OpenGIS Applications, can then "plug into" the framework to join 
the operational environment.  

By building applications to common interfaces, each application can be built without a-
priori or run-time dependencies on other applications or services. Applications and 
services can be added, modified, or replaced without impacting other applications. In 
addition, operational workflows can be changed on-the-fly, allowing rapid response to 
time-critical situations. This loosely coupled, standards-based approach to development 
results in very agile systems—systems that can be flexibly adapted to changing 
requirements and technologies

5.2.4 Publish-find-bind 

The OWS Service Framework is based on the publish/find/bind pattern shown in Figure 
4.  This pattern enables dynamic binding between service providers and requestors.  
Dynamic binding is an essential capability for distributed environments where 
operational needs, sites and applications are frequently changing.

Figure 4 - Publish/Find/Bind Pattern 

In Figure 4, there are three essential roles:  

- Service provider: publishes services to a broker (registry) and delivers services to 
service requestors.  

- Service requestor: performs service discovery operations on the service broker to find 
the service providers it needs and then accesses service providers for provision of the 
desired service.  

- Service broker: helps service providers and service requestors to find each other by 
acting as a registry or clearinghouse of services.  

As shown, there are three essential kinds of operations performed by services:  

- Publish: used to advertise data and services to a broker (such as registry, catalog or 
clearinghouse). A service provider contacts the service broker to publish (or unpublish) a 
service. A service provider typically publishes to the broker metadata describing its 
capabilities and network address.  

- Find: used by service requestors to locate specific service types or instances. Service 
requestors describe the kinds of services they’re looking for to the broker and the broker 
responds by delivering the results that match the request. Service requestors typically use 
metadata published to the broker to find service providers of interest.  

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  9
 



OGC 07-009r3 

- Bind: used when a service requestor and a service provider negotiate, as appropriate, so 
the requestor can access and invoke services of the provider. A service requestor typically 
uses service metadata provided by the broker to bind to a service provider. The service 
requestor can either use a proxy generator to generate the code that can bind to the 
service, or can use the service description to manually implement the binding before 
accessing that service.  Figure 4 also shows that services can be chained with various 
degrees of transparency to achieve larger tasks required by a service  

5.2.5 Multi-platform implementation approach  

Ensure discovery, access, dissemination and management of all GEOINT data stores 
through a web-enabled service-oriented-architecture. [Excerpt from NSG Statement of 
Strategic Intent] 

A Distributed Computing Platform (DCP) is the collection of protocols, services and 
conventions that applications use to invoke remote operations.  There have been many 
popular DCPs over the years including CORBA, DCOM and DCE.  Each of these 
platforms have their strengths and weaknesses.  Web Services must also be viewed as a 
DCP.  Like the others, the web services model has its’ strengths and weaknesses.  There 
are applications for which web services are not appropriate.  We can also expect that, 
with the development of new distributed computing technologies, web services will 
eventually become obsolete.  Developers of interoperability standards must be prepared 
to deal with this continuous change in DCP implementing technology as well as the 
simultaneous fielding of multiple DCP implementations.  The OGC addresses this 
problem by separating the business logic (conceptual specification) from the DCP 
specific implementation guidance (implementation specification).   

In practice, COTS vendors have been able to use this model to develop applications that 
expose themselves over several DCPs simultaneously.  They have also been able to 
rapidly add support for new DCPs since no changes to the application logic is required.

OGC 07-009r3 

 

Figure 5 – Services Interoperability Stack 

HTTP as Distributed Computing Platform  
OGC has defined a suite of Web Service interfaces that have explicit bindings for HTTP. 
Specifically, there are two HTTP bindings for invoking operations of a service (i.e., 
Sending a message): GET and POST. Thus the Online Resource for each operation 
supported by a service instance is an HTTP Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Only the 
parameters comprising the service request itself are mandated by OGC Web Service 
Specifications for HTTP.  

SOAP as an OGC Web Services Enabler  
SOAP is an XML-based remote procedure call protocol that allows messages to be 
exchanged between different services.  SOAP is used for the bind operation described 
above.  Development of SOAP bindings for the existing OGC Web Service specifications 
is underway. 

5.2.6 Multi-tiered architecture 

Multi-tier architecture also known as n-tier architecture or sometimes n-tier computing 
refers to the number of logical levels or layers that the various components of an 
application occupy. Typical tiers include components for user presentation (GUI), 
presentation logic, business or application logic, data access, and data storage. Tiers can 
be physically located anywhere, including on a single computing platform (even in a 
single monolithic application).  In single-platform applications the interaction between 
tiers is tightly coupled by the language the application is written in and/or the architecture 
of the host operating system. In net-centric, enterprise, Internet-based and Web-Service 
applications logical tiers are distributed physically across networks.  In such distributed 
n-tier architectures interoperability between tiers is much more loosely coupled. 
Distributing tiers across several computing platforms presents several interoperability 
challenges managing interactions from tier to tier. Error handling, data exchange, and

OGC 07-009r3 

flow control are examples of transactions that can be more difficult as each tier may run 
on different operating systems, be written in multiple software languages, and 
communicate using several protocols.  Technology-specific enterprise frameworks have 
been developed to address some of these challenges.  Examples of these enterprise 
frameworks include J2EE or .NET, which address interoperability challenges of 
distributed computing by constraining options more narrowly around specific enterprise 
technologies. For example, J2EE is built around java-based technologies and .NET 
around Microsoft Windows.  

The goal of OGC-based architectures is to provide interoperability beyond the technology 
viewpoint. This goal is accomplished by defining higher-level interface specifications 
that are independent of individual technical implementations. This approach helps meet 
the NSG’s common vision for Geospatial Intelligence (see: Geospatial Intelligence 
Standards: Enabling a Common Vision 
http://www.nga.mil/NGASiteContent/StaticFiles/OCR/ncgis-eb.pdf). Distributed n-tier 
architectures have to address interoperability across tiers independent of technology if 
goals such as technology risk reduction, improved choice and competition in the 
marketplace, reduced technology costs, and the ability to rapidly insert new technology 
are to be achieved, (Ibid p.13).  

In an earlier OpenGIS® best practices paper (OpenGIS® web services architecture 
description OGC 05-042r2), OGC has set out a web services architecture around OGC 
interfaces. This n-tier architecture shown in figure TBD defines three services types (or 
components) loosely arranged in four tiers, from Clients to Application Services to 
Processing Services to Information Management Services (but un-needed tiers can be 
bypassed.) 

This Service Oriented Architecture is based on the fundamental roles of service provider 
and service consumer within a distributed computing system. This pattern emphasizes 
that desired computing can be realized by combining multiple services, for each of which 
only the service types (e.g., interfaces and abilities) and server data holdings (e.g. 
content) need be known. It focuses component definition on providing and/or consuming 
a defined service.

Figure 6 - Service tiers in OWS Architecture 

 

As shown n the OWS Architecture service components are organized into multiple tiers. 

1. All components provide services, to clients and/or other components, and each 
component is usually called a service (with multiple implementations) or a server 
(each implementation). 

2. Services (or components) are loosely arranged in four tiers, from Clients to 
Application Services to Processing Services to Information Management 
Services, but un-needed tiers can be bypassed. 

3. Services can use other services within the same tier, and this is common in the 
Processing Services tier. 

4. Each tier of services has a general purpose, which is independent of geographic 
data and services. 

5. Each tier of services includes multiple specific types of services, many of which 
are tailored to geographic data and services. 

 

Information Management Services Tier 

The Information Management Services tier contains services designed to store and 
provide access to data, with each server normally handling multiple separate datasets. In 
addition, metadata describing multiple datasets can be stored and searched. Access is 
usually to retrieve a client-specified subset of a stored dataset, or to retrieve selected 
metadata for all datasets whose metadata meets client-specified query constraints. (OGC 
05-042r2 p 14.) 

 

Examples of Information Management Services include:

 Processing Services Tier 

The Processing Services tier contains services designed to process data, sometimes both 
feature and image (coverage) data. The services in the Processing Services tier are used 
by clients and by services in the Application Services tier. These services can use other 
services in the Processing Services and Information Management Services tiers. (OGC 
05-042r2 p 15-16.) There are many examples of Processing Services and exhaustive list 
is impossible to construct as news processing services are always being proposed and 
developed. Below are several examples.  

SLD enabled Web Map Service (WMS): Dynamically produces spatially referenced 
maps from geographic feature and/or coverage data, returning client-specified 
pictorial renderings of maps in an image format (not actual feature data or coverage 
data) 

Web Terrain Service (WTS): Dynamically produces client-specified perspective 
views from geographic feature and/or coverage data, returning client-specified 
pictorial renderings of data in an image or graphics format

Web 3D Service (W3DS): Dynamically produces client-specified perspective views 
from geographic feature data, returning perspectives of feature data in a graphical 
format 

Web Coordinate Transformation Service (WCTS): Transforms the coordinates of 
feature or coverage data from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another, 
including “transformations”, “conversions”, rectification, and orthorectification 

Web Image Classification Service (WICS): Performs classification of digital images, 
using client-selected supervised or unsupervised image classification method 

Feature Portrayal Service (FPS): Dynamically produces client-specified pictorial 
renderings in an image or graphics format of features and feature collections usually 
dynamically retrieved from a Web Feature Server (WFS) 

Coverage Portrayal Service (CPS): Dynamically produces client-specified pictorial 
renderings in an image or graphics format of a coverage subset dynamically retrieved 
from a Web Coverage Service (WCS) 

Topology Quality Assessment Service (TQAS): Execute logical domain constraints 
(semantic structure) consistency rules on features within a Web Services 
environment. 

Web Processing Service (WPS):  Provide services dynamic access across a network 
to pre-programmed calculations and/or computation models that operate on spatially 
referenced data. The calculation can be extremely simple or highly complex, with 
any number of data inputs and output Process P1 produces results R1-RN from input 
I1-Ii 

Application Services Tier 

The Application Services tier contains services designed to support Clients, especially 
thin client software such as web browsers. That is, these Application Services are 
designed for use by clients instead of each client directly performing these often-needed 
support functions. In “thicker” clients this tier is often contained within the application 
logic of the client and as a consequence concrete implementation specifications for most 
of these services have not yet been developed. The following, however are examples of a 
few of the types of services found in the application services tier. 

• Web portal services: Services that allow a user to interact with multiple 
application services for different data types and purposes 

• WMS application services: Services that allow a user to interact with a (WMS) to 
find, style, and get data of interest 

• Gazetteer application services: Services that allow a user to interact with a 
Gazetteer service 

• Geographic data discovery services: Services that allow a user to locate and 
browse metadata about geographic data, interacting with a catalog 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  15
 



OGC 07-009r3 

• Geographic data extraction services: Services that allow a user to extract and edit 
feature data, interacting with images and feature data 

• Geographic data management services: Services that allow a user to manage 
geospatial data input and retirement, interacting with Information Management 
Services 

• Access control services: Services that control access to other servers, for privacy, 
intellectual property, and other reasons 

 

Tying it all together: Service Interfaces 

Components within and across tiers rely on service interface specifications to define the 
operations that characterize the behavior of the entity.  OGC web service interfaces use 
open standards and are relatively simple. In addition to being well-specified, 
interoperable, and tested; the OGC-specified service interfaces are coarse-grained, 
providing only a few static operations per service. Several of these key service interfaces 
are included in the SDI 1.0 and are providing the foundation for NGA’s interoperable 
net-centric environment.  

5.2.7 Service oriented architecture 

Build a responsive GEOINT IT infrastructure to promote transparency and information 
sharing in a multi-intelligence environment across the DoD and IC.  Ensure discovery, 
access, dissemination and management of all GEOINT data stores through a web-enabled 
service-oriented-architecture. [Excerpt from NSG Statement of Strategic Intent] 

Complementing the Real Time Infrastructure and executing on it will be an extensive 
suite of mission and corporate applications designed as interoperable elements of a 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The SOA will draw upon services provided by 
other entities, entities both externally and within the NSG. It will also make available its 
defined services to those entities for incorporation in their respective mission activities. 
Developing an SOA as a subset to the overall enterprise architecture will serve as a key 
enabler for identifying and maximizing horizontal fusion opportunities and leverage 
economies of scale.  It will allow for leveraging common line-of-business opportunities 
as well as creating efficiencies for overall IT services. To fully leverage the benefits of 
SOA, business managers must make it an integral part of IT management processes, 
including application development outsourcing, investment management and enterprise 
architecture. Web services, a key element of an SOA, promises to improve reuse of 
code and to enable easier composition of new application functions by drawing on 
established subsets of functionality available as services. By wrapping established 
applications in an interface, they can be turned into Web services whose functionality can 
then be leveraged by new applications and other users. The specific instantiations of the 
SOA are generally key IT elements supporting the other components of the OA and as 
such will be addressed as those components are added in future iterations of the ITSP.

OGC 07-009r3 

Web services are self-describing, self-contained, modular units of software that define 
business functionality.  Web services are consumable software services that typically 
include some combination of business logic and data.  Web services can be aggregated to 
establish a larger workflow or business transaction.  Inherently, the architectural 
components of web services support messaging, service descriptions, registries, and 
loosely coupled interoperability.  

It’s important to understand that SOA is a design pattern, not a specific technology.  The 
particular technologies used and governance rules vary depending on the operating 
environment.   

For example, the common practice of web-enabling the interfaces of existing 
applications can work well for a relatively small, centrally managed enterprise.  For 
an environment like the GIG, however, such an approach will result in an 
overwhelming number of similar but incompatible services.  Service consumers will 
have to code their clients for a limited selection of services, thus perpetuating the 
stovepipe model.  This problem is further aggravated by the configuration management 
and security policies that govern DoD and IC systems.  Once accredited, these systems 
cannot be modified.  Therefore, DoD and IC systems can only use services that were 
known to the developer at the time the software was developed. 

The OGC and ISO TC-211 have addressed this problem by creating a taxonomy of 
service interface types and rules for specializing those types as shown below.  This 
approach provides developers with a finite number of well defined and tested interfaces 
to support.  Service providers, in turn, are expected to implement their business logic 
behind one or more of those interfaces.  As a result, the large scale many-to-many 
interactions that SOA promises become possible. 

ISO 19119 Geographic services taxonomy: 
• Geographic human interaction services 
• Geographic model/information management services 
• Geographic workflow/task management services 
• Geographic processing services 

o Geographic processing services – spatial 
o Geographic processing services – thematic 
o Geographic processing services – temporal 
o Geographic processing services – metadata 

• Geographic communication services 
• Geographic system management services 

 

Implementing technology, or Distributed Computing Platform (DCP), is also dependent 
on the operating environment.  For example, GeoConnections Canada is a SOA 
implementation which integrates geospatial services across all of Canada.  Due to the 
very loose coupling among the services and the budget constraints of the participating 
organizations, GeoConnections has opted for a simple HTTP get/put DCP.  All service 
invocations are encoded using a URL with a set of key/value pairs representing the 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  17
 



OGC 07-009r3 

operation name and parameters.   This approach has proven to be easy to implement and 
is easily adaptable to changes in the supporting technology. 

For NGA and the GIG environment, a more complex approach is needed.  While 
services in this environment are still loosely coupled, there are additional security, 
performance and reliability requirements.  These requirements lead us to a SOAP based 
DCP.  Effective July 2006, all future revisions of existing and new OWS interface 
specifications must include an optional SOAP messaging binding and the binding must 
be expressed in WSDL.  While it is true that some OGC specifications do not currently 
have approved SOAP bindings, the separation of binding from service definition makes 
the development of SOAP bindings relatively straight forward.  In fact, implementations 
of the draft OGC SOAP interfaces are available from some SCOTS vendors. 

Applicable OGC Specifications: 

• OGC Topic 12 which is also ISO 19119, Geographic Information Services. (02-
112) 

5.2.8 Information 

Technology comes and goes but data lives forever. 

The most valuable part of any IT enterprise is the data that has been accumulated.  This 
value, however, depends on that data being sufficient, available, comprehensible and of 
acceptable quality.  In other words: 

• The data structures must be sufficiently rich to capture all of the information that 
users might need, 

• There must be an easy way to find and access the data, 

• Once accessed, the users’ tools have to be able to process (understand) the data. 

• Data being of acceptable quality may include a certain positional accuracy, a 
certain currency, a certain fitness for use. 

Data sufficiency poses a problem, how do you know what information to include if you 
don’t know who or how that data will be used?  The OGC and ISO address this issue by 
approaching data definition from the producer perspective as opposed to the consumer.  
The question becomes not “what information do I need” but “what information can I 
provide”.  Data models are defined in terms of our ability to collect data regardless of 
how it my ultimately be used. 

A producer focus can produce data models that are very complex.  To manage this 
complexity, the OGC and ISO have developed a set of rules for creating Application 
Profiles of more complex data models.  Application Profiles are tailored data models 
specific to a particular domain.  To date application profiles have been created for several 
NGA data types.  These are:

Another consequence of the producer focus is that data models should not make any 
assumptions about how they will be used.  In particular, data content is separated from 
the representation of that content.  This runs counter to traditional geospatial products 
such as VPF.  However, it is in line with current DoD data policy as documented in the 
DoD Data Strategy.  It is also in line with the planned update of Common Warfighting

5.3.1 OGC Web Map Service Overview 

A Web Map Service (WMS) produces maps of spatially referenced data dynamically 
from geographic information. This International Standard defines a "map" to be a 
portrayal of geographic information as a digital image file suitable for display on a 
computer screen. A map is not the data itself. WMS-produced maps are generally 
rendered in a pictorial format such as PNG, GIF or JPEG, or occasionally as vector-based 
graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics 
Metafile (WebCGM) formats. 

This International Standard defines three operations: one returns service-level metadata; 
another returns a map whose geographic and dimensional parameters are well-defined; 
and an optional third operation returns information about particular features shown on a 
map. Web Map Service operations can be invoked using a standard web browser by 
submitting requests in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The content of 
such URLs depends on which operation is requested. In particular, when requesting a 
map the URL indicates what information is to be shown on the map, what portion of the 
Earth is to be mapped, the desired coordinate reference system, and the output image 
width and height. When two or more maps are produced with the same geographic 
parameters and output size, the results can be accurately overlaid to produce a composite 
map. The use of image formats that support transparent backgrounds (e.g., GIF or PNG) 
allows underlying maps to be visible. Furthermore, individual maps can be requested 
from different servers. The Web Map Service thus enables the creation of a network of 
distributed map servers from which clients can build customized maps. 

This International Standard applies to a Web Map Service that publishes its ability to 
produce maps rather than its ability to access specific data holdings. A basic WMS 
classifies its geographic information holdings into "Layers" and offers a finite number of 
predefined "Styles" in which to display those layers. This International Standard supports 
only named Layers and Styles, and does not include a mechanism for user defined 
symbolization of feature data.

5.3.2 OGC Styled Layer Descriptor Overview 

The ability for a human or machine client to define symbolization rules requires a styling 
language that the client and server can both understand. This styling language is called 
Symbology Encoding (SE OGC 04-095) and it can be used to portray the output of Web 
Map Servers, Web Feature Servers and Web Coverage Servers. 

Styling can be described using a user-defined XML encoding of a map’s appearance 
called a Styled-Layer Descriptor (SLD).  An SLD includes a StyledLayerDescriptor 
XML element that contains a sequence of styled-layer definitions. These styled-layer 
definitions may use named or user-defined layers and named or user-defined styling.  The 
structuring of SLD UserStyles into SE FeatureTypeStyles/CoverageStyles and Rules 
provides convenient packaging for this purpose, since rules identify each different kind of 
graphic symbolization that may be present in a map. Given the information in an SLD 
UserStyle, a map-viewer client could generate a legend entry for a layer. 

There are two basic ways to style a data set. The simplest one is to color all features the 
same way. For example, one can imagine a layer advertised by a WMS as “hydrography” 
consisting of lines (rivers and streams) and polygons (lakes, ponds, oceans, etc.). A user 
might want to tell the server to color the insides of all polygons in a light blue, and color 
the boundaries of all polygons and all lines in a darker blue. This type of styling requires 
no knowledge of the attributes or “feature types” of the underlying data, only a language 
with which to describe these styles. This requirement is addressed by the 
FeatureTypeStyle element in the SE document. 

A more complicated requirement is to style features of the data differently depending on 
some attribute. For example, in a roads data set, style highways with a three-pixel red 
line; style four-lane roads in a two-pixel black line; and style two-lane roads in a one-
pixel black line. Accomplishing this requires the user to be able to find out what attribute 
of the data set represents the road type. SLD profile of WMS defines the operation that 
fulfils this need, called DescribeLayer.  This operation returns the feature types of the 
layer or layers specified in the request, and the attributes can be discovered with the 
DescribeFeatureType operation of a WFS interface or the DescribeCoverageType of a 
WCS interface. 

Three approaches are defined to allow a client to take advantage of SLD symbology: 

a) The client interacts with the WMS using HTTP GET but the request can 
reference a remote SLD. 

b) The client uses the HTTP GET method but includes the SLD XML document in-
line with the GET request in an SLD_BODY CGI parameter (with appropriate 
character encoding). 

c) The client interacts with the WMS using HTTP POST with the GetMap request 
encoded in XML , as described in section 9.2.3 and including an embedded SLD.

OGC 07-009r3 

5.3.3 OGC Web Feature Service Overview 

The OpenGIS® Web Feature Service (WFS) Implementation Specification allows a 
client to retrieve and update geospatial data encoded in Geography Markup Language 
(GML) from multiple Web Feature Services. The specification defines interfaces for data 
access and manipulation operations on geographic features, using HTTP as the 
distributed computing platform. Via these interfaces, a Web user or service can combine, 
use and manage geodata -- the feature information behind a map image -- from different 
sources. 

The requirements for a Basic Web Feature Service are: 

• The interfaces must be defined in XML. 
• GML must be used to express features within the interface. 
• At a minimum a WFS must be able to present features using GML. 
• The predicate or filter language will be defined in XML and be derived from CQL 

as defined in the OpenGIS Catalog Interface Implementation Specification. 
• The datastore used to store geographic features should be opaque to client 

applications and their only view of the data should be through the WFS interface. 
• The use of a subset of XPath expressions for referencing 
 

In addition to the Basic WFS there is an XLink WFS and WFS Transactional.  An XLink 
WFS supports all the operations of a Basic WFS and in addition it implements the 
GetGmlObject operation for local and/or remote XLinks, and offers the option for the 
GetGmlObject operation to be performed during GetFeature operations.  The result is that 
a WFS could service a request to retrieve element instances by traversing XLinks that 
refer to their XML IDs. In addition, the client may specify whether nested XLinks 
embedded in returned element data should also be retrieved. 

 
Transactional WFS supports the Transactional operation. A transaction request is 
composed of operations that modify features; that is create, update, and delete operations 
on geographic features.  Optionally, a transaction WFS could implement the 
GetGmlObject and/or LockFeature 

 
5.3.4 OGC Web Coverage Service Overview 

The Web Coverage Service (WCS) supports electronic retrieval of geospatial data as 
"coverages" – that is, digital geospatial information representing space-varying 
phenomena. 

A WCS provides access to potentially detailed and rich sets of geospatial information, in 
forms that are useful for client-side rendering, multi-valued coverages, and input into 
scientific models and other clients. The WCS may be compared to the OGC Web Map 
Service (WMS) and the Web Feature Service (WFS); like them it allows clients to choose 
portions of a server's information holdings based on spatial constraints and other criteria. 
Unlike the WMS [OGC 04-024], which portrays spatial data to return static maps 
(rendered as pictures by the server), the Web Coverage Service provides available data 
together with their detailed descriptions; defines a rich syntax for requests against these 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  21
 



OGC 07-009r3 

data; and returns data with its original semantics (instead of pictures) which may be 
interpreted, extrapolated, etc. – and not just portrayed. 

Unlike WFS, which returns discrete geospatial features, the Web Coverage Service 
returns coverages representing space-varying phenomena that relate a spatio-temporal 
domain to a (possibly multidimensional) range of properties. 

A description of WCS and JPIP are provided in Section 5.5.3. 

5.3.5 Catalog 

•  Data Catalogs.  The regional data centers will each automatically maintain catalogs of 
the data and information they contain.  When data searches are conducted, the queries 
will be responded to by data center catalog services and provide the requesters with all 
relevant information in response to the query.  This information will include content 
parameters such as source and age of the data as well as management data such as when 
originally stored, last verified and last retrieved.  Content metadata will convey the 
confidence level of data in terms of reliability, currency and accuracy.       

A catalog is a database of information about geospatial resources (data, services, and 
related information objects) available to a group or community of users. A catalog 
typically stores descriptive information about the resource being described, and does not 
store the information resource itself. The interfaces on catalogs enable services that are 
collectively referred to as Catalog Services in OGC. We use the term “catalog” or 
“catalog services” to describe the set of service interfaces that support organization, 
discovery, and access of geospatial information. Catalog services help users or 
application software to find information that exists anywhere in a distributed computing 
environment. These resources function in this environment through interfaces that 
implement OpenGIS Specifications. Interaction with geospatial data collections via their 
metadata is done via catalog services.  Catalog services are required to support the 
discovery and binding to registered information resources within an information 
community. 

5.3.5.1 Catalog components 

The OpenGIS Catalog Service Interface Specification enables diverse but conformant 
applications to perform discovery, browse and query operations against distributed and 
potentially heterogeneous catalog servers. The Catalog Interface specification uses 
metadata and spatial location to identify and select data sources of interest, and provides 
for interoperability in catalog update, maintenance, and other librarian functions.  

22 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

The General Catalog Interface Model provides a set of abstract service interfaces that 
support the discovery, access, maintenance and organization of catalogs of geospatial 
information and related resources. The interfaces specified are intended to allow users or 
application software to find information that exists in multiple distributed computing 
environments, including the World Wide Web (WWW) environment. All behavior 
requiring sessions is expressed by a dynamic model of conversation state and state 
transitions. The model expresses the states and messages that trigger the changes in state.  

An Application Profile is predicated on the existence of one protocol binding in the base 
specification. In the case of the Catalog Services Specification, a profile could reference 
CORBA, Z39.50, or HTTP protocol bindings. In most, but not all, protocol bindings, 
there may be restrictions or refinements on implementation of the General Model agreed 
within an implementation community. 

Figure 7 - Catalog Reference Model Architecture, shows the Reference Architecture 
assumed for development of the OGC Catalog Interface. The architecture is a multi-tier 
arrangement of clients and servers. To provide a context, the architecture shows more 
than just catalog interfaces. The bold lines illustrate the scope of OGC Catalog and 
Features interfaces. 

The Application Client shown in Figure 7 - Catalog Reference Model Architecture 
interfaces with the Catalog Service using the OGC Catalog Interface. The Catalog 
Service may draw on one of three sources to respond to the Catalog Service request: a 
Metadata Repository local to the Catalog Service, a Resource service, or another Catalog 
Service. The interface to the local Metadata Repository is internal to the Catalog Service. 
The interface to the Resource service can be a private or OGC Interface. The interface 
between Catalog Services is the OGC Catalog Interface. In this case, a Catalog Service is 
acting as both a client and server. Data returned from an OGC Catalog Service query is 
processed by the requesting Catalog Service to return the data appropriate to the original 
Catalog request.

Resources in a catalog are discovered using a filter. Queries can be temporally 
constrained using the standard scalar operators found in the Filter specification 
(PropertyIsBetween, PropertyIsEqualTo, etc ...).  However, the Filter specification does

OGC 07-009r3 

not formally define temporal operators at the time; the operators like Inside, Overlaps, etc 
could be applied to temporal data to achieve this task. 

Here is an example of a temporal query finding records modified between two specific 
dates that uses scalar operators to constrain the "modified" property:

                  </ogc:UpperBoundary> 
               </ogc:PropertyIsBetween> 
            </ogc:Filter> 
         </Constraint> 
      </Query> 
   </GetRecords> 
5.3.5.2 Catalog as registry 

Catalogs may be used to store information published as a result of a registration process. 
Such catalogs may reference and describe services, data types or schemas, semantic 
definitions, vocabularies, namespaces, or other common resources.  The intrinsic features 
of a catalog service now include core registry functions, including: 

• Life cycle management of metadata items (i.e. administrative status) 

• Flexible classification of metadata items employing user-defined classification 
schemes (i.e. subject-based metadata) 

• Asserting arbitrary relationships among metadata items (i.e. links or cross-
references) 

• Access control 

• Change tracking (i.e. maintenance of audit trails) 

• The discovery of resources pertaining to geospatial services and data requires 
ready access to several forms of metadata: 

24 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

• Metadata that describes services, schemas, presentation rules, spatial reference 
systems, and other shared resources;  Reference OGC GEOINT Structure 
Implementation Profile Schema Processing (07-028) for an example of DDMS 
1.3 Metadata for GML. 

• Content metadata that characterizes data sets and imagery resources through 
controlled and uncontrolled vocabularies; 

• Links or associations between interdependent resources (or portions of resources); 

• Annotations—perhaps transient—that are attached to a resource for a specific 
purpose or community of users. 

A catalog that can accommodate all of these forms of metadata can be used to support a 
wide variety of discovery scenarios that involve multiple communities of practice.  

5.3.5.3 Service publishing 

A service catalog, or service registry, is a type of metadata catalog about service 
instances for use by software and human clients, published as a result of a registration 
process using pull (harvest) or push (registration API) techniques. A service catalog is 
thus an instance of an OGC Catalog with an administrative set of interfaces (e.g. add, 
update, delete) that permit registration of service metadata. Service catalogs can be global 
or private. Registration acts to publish the presence of a resource, providing for limited 
search and browsing and general “yellow pages” access. Formal Web Service Registries 
are implemented as catalogs of businesses, their services, and operations. Examples of 
public service catalog approaches include ebXMLi and UDDI, with interface bindings 
available in various programming environments. 

Any service-oriented architecture must support some fundamental interactions: 
registering service offers (publishing) and returning service offers upon request according 
to some criteria (finding). The service catalog provides interfaces for querying and 
managing a metadata repository. A catalog client is an application used to query the 
catalog or submit items to be registered.

Figure 8 - Catalog ebRIM Model 

A block diagram is presented that contains all the components of a catalog system: 
ebRIM model, CSW server, content repository and perhaps content manager. 

The ebRIM Profile of the catalog server for the web provides a rich classification schema 
and user defined collection of classification nodes.  This classification schema enables 
the creation of packages to logically organize objects such as heterogeneous collections 
of dataset descriptions, service offerings, application schemas, feature types, sensor 
description, and digital rights among others. 

The OGC registry information model (ogcRIM) is based on the ebXML registry 
information model (ebRIM, v 2.1). A catalog service can be viewed as a type of 
management system that fulfills a basic repository function in open, distributed systems. 
Its core capabilities include: 

• Provide persistent type information for use in service discovery; 
• Facilitate dynamic (i.e. late or run-time) binding to service instances; 
• Provide support for run-time type checking for safety;  
• Be linked to—or federated with—other catalogs. 

 

Every catalog instance implements an information model that provides a high-level 
schema that defines what types of objects are stored in the catalog and how they are 
organized. Prominent models within the web services realm include the UDDI data 
model as well as the ebXML registry information model (ebRIM). The APIs associated 
with both models support multiple query patterns: browse and drill-down (by category), 
or filtered queries against specified catalog objects. However, the ebRIM is more general

OGC 07-009r3 

and extensible—it draws on the ISO 11179 set of standards to provide comprehensive 
facilities for managing metadata. 

 

Figure 9 - Catalog Class Model 

Above is a general UML model of OGC catalog service interfaces, in the form of a class 
diagram. This model shows the Catalog Service class plus five other classes with which 
that class is associated. A Catalog Service is a realization of an OGC Service. Each 
instance of the Catalog Service class is associated with two or more of these other 
classes, depending on the abilities included in that service instance. Each of these other 
classes defines one or several related operations that can be included in a Catalog Service 
class instance. 

The OGC approach of using ebRIM as the metadata model for Catalogs provides an 
extensible approach for building registries of many types.  Registries in the NSG are 
needed for datasets, services, feature catalogues, dictionaries, reports, pictures, etc.  The 
ebRIM approach allows for the Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) to be extended to 
each of these additional registry types without major revision to the interface.  In the past 
OGC has developed CSW profiles for specific items, e.g., CSW Profile for ISO 
19115/19119 provides a CSW interface for datasets and services.  As NSG has 
requirements for registries beyond just geospatial datasets and services, the best approach 
is to use the CSW-ebRIM Profile.

5.3.6 Security and GeoDRM 

All organizations have unique information assets that can contribute to the common 
relevant operational picture and support unified action.  They also have unique 
information requirements.  Sharing information with appropriately cleared participants 
and integration of information from all sources are essential. [Excerpt from Vision 2020] 

Information assurance (IA) encompasses those capabilities that protect and defend 
information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, 
authentication, confidentiality and continued operation.  NSG information systems will 
operate in an increasingly complex and dynamic world as technologies, threats, and 
operational concepts evolve, and NSG organizations will operate with interconnected 
systems with multiple points of vulnerability. A risk assumed by anyone is a risk 
assumed by all.  Many adversaries are seeking avenues for asymmetric force projection 
against the United States and its allies, and their strategies include attempts to disable, 
disrupt, or discredit information generation and management capabilities.  These 
strategies may include passive monitoring of communications, active network attacks, 
direct attacks, exploitation of insiders, and attacks through industry information 
technology providers.  

The domain is a fundamental concept for traditional approaches to information assurance.  
All enforcement of an organizations’ security policy takes place within the domain.  
Systems and personnel within the domain are trusted, to a point.  Systems and personnel 
outside of the domain are not trusted.  Outside access to domain resources is only 
possible through a controlled interface (CI).  Access is restricted to only those principals 
who can be trusted to comply with the security policy.  

Use of OGC interfaces as part of the CI to a domain has been explored through several 
OGC initiatives, most notably the Critical Infrastructure Protection Initiative (CIPI).  
Under CIPI, OGC web services authenticated incoming users using DoD PKI certificates.  
A trusted path to the users' client was then established using an SSL session.  Behind the 
interface, an X.509 based infrastructure supported the Identification & Authentication 
(I&A), policy enforcement and access control functions necessary to enforce a fine-
grained discretionary access control security policy.

OGC 07-009r3 

Under this model users only see a standards based interface.  The actual data stores, 
network topology and even data structures are hidden behind the interface.        

Additional work in the area includes the development of GeoXACML, a geospatially 
enabled version of XACML. (OGC - 05-036).  Work on Security Assertions Markup 
Language (SAML) based PKI authentication has also been undertaken by OGC members, 
however progress through the OGC process requires the adoption of SOAP bindings.  
SAML makes use of statements which assert certain characteristics of a subject (claims), 
e.g. a subject's authentication, name and role. SAML can be used to encode qualified 
identity tokens and may be combined with XML-Signature. SAML is a very flexible 
XML based specification and can be used in a multitude of scenarios. One of the 
problems that it tries to solve is the Single Sign On problem and in this way it can be 
used for authentication in scenarios. Because it addresses Single Sign On, SAML is of 
course ideal for federation scenarios where users come from a different security domain 
than the one where the service provider is. 

Under a net-centric model, mission applications make use of resources from anywhere on 
the network.  Therefore, a significant portion of the processing will be done by services 
that the users’ organization does not own.  This sharing of resources requires that 
information travel extensively outside of the enclave.  The information assurance model 
has to change from one of just protecting resources within the enclave to protecting 
resources as they travel around the network.  The OGC is addressing this need by 
partnering with the developers of Digital Rights Management (DRM) standards. 

The objective of DRM is to assure that only licensed holders of digital content can use 
that content and to control the ways in which the content is used.  If we consider the 
license to be a security policy, the goals of DRM are complementary to those of 
Information Assurance.  DRM will not provide the level of assurance needed to protect at 
the classification level (secret, TS, etc.) but may be sufficient for releasability caveats. 
OGC focus is how to Geo-enable these technologies and the ramifications of service 
chaining/orchestration on digital rights.  By working with main-stream DRM efforts, the 
OGC has minimized the risk that their work is incompatible with the rest of the industry.

5.4 Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) for NSG 

5.4.1 Introduction 

A Sensor Web refers to web accessible sensor networks and archived sensor data that can 
be discovered and accessed using standard protocols and application program interfaces 
(APIs). In much the same way that the HTML and HTTP standards enabled the exchange 
of information on the Web, the Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) Sensor Web 
Enablement (SWE) initiative is focused on standards that enable the discovery, exchange, 
and processing of sensor observations, as well as the tasking of sensor systems. These 
protocols are designed to work with a broad range of sensor types, ranging from in-situ 
sensors to space-borne sensors.  The functionality that the OCG has included within SWE 
includes:  

• Discovery of sensors, observations, and processes – to easily discover all sensor 
assets (sensor systems, simulations, and data processes) that are available for 
meeting users needs in a timely fashion; this is particularly important for 
facilitating situational awareness in dynamic environments. 

• Determination of a sensor’s capabilities and an observation’s reliability – 
readily assess the capabilities of a sensor or simulation system, as well as provide 
sufficient lineage of an observation to determine its reliability for decision support 

• Access to parameters and processes that allow on-demand processing of 
observations – provide the means to sufficiently support on-demand geolocation 
and processing of sensor observations by generic software, without the need for a 
priori knowledge of the sensor system 

• Retrieval of real-time or time-series observations in standard encodings – to 
access and immediately utilize observations from newly discovered sensors 
within decision support tools, models, and simulations without needing to develop 
sensor-specific applications 

• Tasking of sensors and simulators to acquire observations of interest – to task 
a sensor or simulation system, and to provide collection requirements, using a 
common interface; this interface supports tasking as simple as controlling a web 
cam, as well as something as sophisticated as a military surveillance asset 

• Subscription to and publishing of alerts based on sensor or simulation 
observations -  a means by which a sensor system or simulation can publish alerts 
to be issued by sensors or sensor services based upon certain criteria, and allow a 
user to subscribe to and receive these alerts when criteria are met; such criteria 
could be a simple as a measured value exceeding a certain threshold or as 
complex as pattern recognition within a single or multiple observations

Figure 10 - Sensor Web Concept 

 
Within the SWE initiative, the enablement of such sensor webs is being pursued through 
the establishment of several encodings for describing sensors and sensor observations, 
and through several standard interface definitions for web services.  Sensor Web 
Enablement standards that have been built and prototyped by members of the OGC 
include the following OpenGIS Specifications: 

1. Sensor Model Language (SensorML) – standard models and XML Schema for 
describing the processes within sensor and observation processing systems; 
provides information needed for discovery, georeferencing, and processing of 
observations, as well as tasking sensors and simulations. 

2. Observations & Measurements (O&M) - The general models and XML 
encodings for observations and measurements made using sensors.  

3. Transducer Model Language (TML) –XML encoding for supporting real-time 
streaming observations and tasking commands to and from sensor systems. 

4. Sensor Observation Service (SOS) – An open interface for a service by which a 
client can obtain observations and sensor and platform descriptions from one or 
more sensors. 

5. Sensor Planning Service (SPS) – An open interface for a service by which a 
client can 1) determine the feasibility of collecting data from one or more sensors 
or models and 2) submit collection requests to these sensors and configurable 
processes.

OGC 07-009r3 

6. Sensor Alert Service (SAS) – An open interface for a web service for publishing 
of and subscribing to deliverable alerts from sensor or simulation systems. 

7. Web Notification Service (WNS) – An open interface for a service by which a 
client may conduct asynchronous dialogues, or message interchanges, with one or 
more other services.

Figure 11 - SWE Information Models 

 

The SWE standards infrastructure defined by these specifications constitutes a revolution 
in the discovery, assessment and control of live data sources and archived sensor data.  
The SWE architecture was designed to enable the creation of web-accessible sensor 
assets through common interfaces and encodings. Sensor assets may include the sensors 
themselves, observation archives, simulations, and observation processing algorithms. 
SWE not only enables interoperability among disparate networks of sensors and among 
disparate models and simulations, but it also enables increased interoperability between 
sensors and models, and between these and the decision support tools where the final 
application of observations occurs.

Integrate the collection and exploitation management of airborne, commercial, and 
advanced geospatial intelligence and satellite data. Accelerate the standardization of 
sensor data, metadata, compression formats and file identifiers. [Excerpt from NSG  
Statement of Strategic Intent] 

It has long been recognized that the current state of sensor networks are developed 
around different communities of sensor types and user types, with each community 
typically relying on its own stovepipe system for discovery, accessing observations, 
receiving alerts, and tasking sensor systems and models. Even within fairly coherent 
communities, each type of sensor tends to be accompanied by its on metadata semantics, 
its own data formats, and its own software.  

Within such stovepipe systems, the ability to discover and utilize a new sensor asset is 
typically hindered by incompatible encodings and services. Additionally, readily 
available information regarding the sensor system, the observation encodings, processing, 
and supporting services is typically lacking, scattered, or incomplete. Within these 
systems, adding support for a new sensor asset to an existing decision support tool or 
processing operation takes at best several days, and at worst many months or years, 
accompanied by high expense.  

5.4.2 Sensor Model Language (SensorML) [OGC 05-086r2] 

The measurement of phenomena that results in an observation consists of a series of 
processes, beginning with the processes of sampling and detecting and followed perhaps 
by processes of data manipulation. The division between measurement and “post-
processing” has become blurred with the introduction of more complex and intelligent 
sensors, as well as the application of more on-board processing of observations. The 
typical Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor is a prime example of a device that 
consists of basic detectors complemented by a series of complex processes that result in 
the observations of position, heading, and velocity.  

SensorML defines models and XML Schema for describing any process, including 
measurement by a sensor system, as well as post-measurement processing. SensorML 
supports a variety of needs within the sensor community, including:   

Discovery of sensor, sensor systems, and processes - SensorML is a means by 
which sensor systems or processes can make themselves known and discoverable. 
SensorML provides a rich collection of metadata that can be mined and used for 
discovery of sensor systems and observation processes.  

On-demand processing of Observations - Process chains for geolocation or higher-
level processing of observations can be described in SensorML, discovered and 
distributed over the web, and executed on-demand without a priori knowledge of the 
sensor or processor characteristics.

OGC 07-009r3 

 Lineage of Observations - SensorML can provide a complete and unambiguous 
description of the lineage of an observation. In other words, it can describe in detail 
the process by which an observation came to be, from acquisition by one or more 
detectors to processing and perhaps even interpretation by an analyst. Not only can 
this provide a confidence level with regard to an observation, in most cases, part or all 
of the process could be repeated, perhaps with some modifications to the process or by 
simulating the observation with a known signature source. 

Support for tasking, observation, and alert services - SensorML descriptions of 
sensor systems or simulations can be mined in support of establishing OGC Sensor 
Observation Services (SOS), Sensor Planning Services (SPS), and Sensor Alert 
Services (SAS). SensorML defines and builds on common data definitions that are 
used throughout the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework.  

 Plug-N-Play, auto-configuring, and autonomous sensor networks - SensorML 
enables the development of plug-n-play sensors, simulations, and processes, which 
seamlessly be added to Decision Support systems. The self-describing characteristic of 
SensorML-enabled sensors and processes also supports the development of auto-
configuring sensor networks, as well as the development of autonomous sensor 
networks in which sensors can publish alerts and tasks to which other sensors can 
subscribe and react. 

 Archiving of Sensor Parameters - Finally, SensorML provides a mechanism for 
archiving fundamental parameters and assumptions regarding sensors and processes, 
so that observations from these systems can still be reprocessed and improved long 
after the origin mission has ended. This is proving to be critical for long-range 
applications such as global change monitoring and modeling. 

Within SensorML, everything including detectors, actuators, filters, and operators are 
defined as process models. A ProcessModel defines the inputs, outputs, parameters, and 
method for that process, as well as a collection of metadata useful for discovery and 
human assistance.  The inputs, outputs, and parameters are all defined using SWE 
Common data types. Process metadata includes identifiers, classifiers, constraints (time, 
legal, and security), capabilities, characteristics, contacts, and references, in addition to 
inputs, outputs, parameters, and system location. 

These individual processes, as well as data sources, can the linked within a ProcessChain 
such that one can describe either the process by which an observation was derived (i.e. its 
lineage) or a process by which additional information can be derived from an existing 
observation. The SensorML System allows one to relate one or more processes to the 
“real world” by allowing one to specify relative locations and data interfaces.  

SensorML is currently an OGC Implementation Specification version 1.0, document 
number 05-086r2.

5.4.3 Observations and Measurements (O&M) [OGC 05-087r4] 

The O&M specification provides a standard XML-based package for returning 
observation results. Using a standard package in which to download observations from an 
SOS alleviates the need to support a wide range of sensor-specific and community-
specific data formats. The O&M Observation provides a standard that combines the 
flexibility and extensibility provided by XML with an efficient means to package large 
amounts of data as ASCII or binary blocks. 

As defined within the O&M specification, an Observation is an event with a result which 
has a value describing some phenomenon.  The observation is modeled as a Feature 
within the context of the ISO/OGC Feature Model.  An observation feature binds the 
result to the feature of interest, upon which it was made.  An observation uses a 
procedure to determine the value, which may involve a sensor or observer, analytical 
procedure, simulation or other numerical process.  This procedure would typically be 
described as a process within SensorML. The observation pattern and feature is primarily 
useful for capturing metadata associated with data capture. 

The O&M specification allows for extension of the Observation object to support various 
styles of providing observation result values. This is an area of current research to define 
styles that adequately and efficiently support both simple and complex results, as well as 
perhaps legacy formats and out-of-band data. 

As of December 2006, the O&M Specification OGC 05-87r4 has been approved for 
release as a Draft Implementation Specification with the intent to immediately begin the 
RFC process toward final approval as an OGC Technical Specification. 
 

5.4.4 SWE Common [OGC 05-086r2; OGC 05-087r2] 

There are several common core definitions used throughout the SWE framework that 
have been pulled from other SWE specifications, such as O&M and SensorML, and have 
been placed within the SWE Common namespace. These are currently not defined within 
a separate document, but rather are defined within SensorML or O&M specification 
documents. Future releases may separate SWE Common definitions into a separate 
document. The SWE Common data definitions are used throughout the SWE framework 
to provide a “common” means to specify expected or observed data components. The 
common definitions for data components, encoding, and phenomenon are currently used 
throughout every SWE component with the exception of TML.  This issue has been 
identified as area requiring future harmonization work with SensorML and will be 
address in future efforts. 

5.4.5 Transducer Model Language (TML) [OGC 06-010r5] 

Transducer Markup Language (TML) is a method and message format for describing 
information about transducers and transducer systems and capturing, exchanging, and 
archiving live, historical and future data received and produced by them.  A transducer is 
a superset of sensors and actuators.  TML provides a mechanism to efficiently and 

36 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

effectively capture, transport and archive transducer data, in a common form, regardless 
of the original source.  Having a common data language for transducers enables a TML 
process and control system to exchange command (control data) and status (sensor data) 
information with a transducer system incorporating TML technology.  TML utilizes 
XML for the capture and exchange of data. 

TML was designed with the express goal of facilitating the development of a “Common” 
Transducer Processing/Control machine while also facilitating interoperable machine-to-
machine communications.  For the purposes of data fusion and post analysis, it is 
paramount to preserve raw transducer data in as close a manner to the original form as 
possible.  Although data would be ideally preserved in its raw format, it is impossible in 
some cases to do so.  TML provides facilities to capture data at any stage, from raw 
production, to partially processed, to final data forms.  Greater benefits of TML are 
realized the closer to the source raw data one gets. 

Transducer Markup Language (TML) defines: 

• a set of models describing the hardware response characteristics of a transducer   

• an efficient method for transporting sensor data and preparing it for fusion 
through spatial and temporal associations 

Sensor data is often an artifact of the sensor’s internal processing rather than a true record 
of phenomena state. The effects of this processing on sensed phenomena are hardware-
based and can be characterized as functions.   

TML response models are formalized XML descriptions of these known hardware 
behaviors. The models can be used to reverse distorting effects and return artifact values 
to the phenomena realm. TML provides models for a transducer’s latency and integration 
times, noise figure, spatial and temporal geometries, frequency response, steady-state 
response and impulse response. 

Traditional XML wraps each data element in a semantically meaningful tag. The rich 
semantic capability of XML is in general better suited to data exchange rather than live 
delivery where variable bandwidth is a factor. TML addresses the live scenario. The 
TML cluster is a terse XML envelope designed for efficient transport of live multiplex 
sensor data.  It also provides a mechanism for temporal correlation to other transducer 
data. 

In March 2007, the TML specification document OGC 06-010r5 expected to be approved 
as an Implementation Specification.  
 

5.4.6 Sensor Observation Service (SOS) [OGC 06-009r2] 

The goal of SOS is to provide access to observations from sensors and sensor systems in 
a standard way that is consistent for all sensor systems including remote, in-situ, fixed, 
airborne, space-borne and other mobile sensors.  This is a challenging task because the 
users of sensor data have historically been divided into those who primarily deal with in-

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  37
 



OGC 07-009r3 

situ sensors and those who primarily deal with remote sensors. The terminology, 
perspective, and expectations of these two broad groups are different.  SOS leverages the 
Observation and Measurements (O&M) specification for modeling sensor observations 
and the SensorML specification for modeling sensors and sensor systems.   

An SOS organizes collections of related sensor system observations into Observation 
Offerings.  An Observation Offering is analogous to a “layer” in Web Map Service 
because each offering is intended to be a non-overlapping group of related observations.  
Each Observation Offering is constrained by a number of parameters including the 
following: 

• Specific sensor systems that report the observations, 

• Time period(s) for which observations may be requested (supports historical 
data),  

• Phenomena that are being sensed,  

• Geographical region that contains the sensors, and  

• Geographical region that is the subject of the sensor observations (may differ 
from the sensor region for remote sensors) 

The approach that has been taken in the development of SOS, and the SWE specifications 
on which it depends, is to carefully model sensors, sensor systems, and observations in 
such a way that the model covers all varieties of sensors and supports the requirements of 
all users of sensor data.  This is in contrast to the approach that was taken with the Web 
Feature Service (WFS).  WFS provides a generic definition of a geographic feature that is 
flexible enough to encompass any real-world entity.  The WFS uses GML application 
schemas to define the specific properties of each type of feature.  With this approach, 
interoperability requires organizations to agree on domain-specific GML application 
schemas.  Clients that access a WFS in a particular domain must have a-priori knowledge 
of the application schemas used in that domain.  The SOS approach defines a common 
model for all sensors, sensor systems and their observations.  This model is not domain-
specific and can be used without a-priori knowledge of domain-specific application 
schemas.  In May 2007, the SOS specification document OGC 06-009r2 is expected to be 
approved as an Implementation Specification. 
 

5.4.7 Sensor Alert Service (SAS) [OGC 06-028r3] 

The SAS can be compared with an event notification system. An SAS might therefore 
provide a wide variety of alerts related to sensors and sensor observations including, as 
examples, measured values above a threshold, detected motion or the presence of a 
recognizable feature, or perhaps sensor status (e.g. low battery, shutdown or startup).  

An SAS can advertise what alerts it can provide. A consumer (interested party) may 
subscribe to alerts disseminated by the SAS. If an event occurs the SAS will publish an 

38 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

alert and notify all clients subscribed to this event type through a messaging service, such 
as WNS.  

The SAS specifies an interface that allows measurement or processing systems to 
advertise and publish observational data or its describing metadata respectively. It is 
important to emphasize that the SAS itself acts rather like a registry than an event 
notification system. A messaging server (which can be on the same server as the SAS or 
separate) is indeed responsible for issuing alerts. 

Traditional OGC web services are not suitable for implementing this alert service. Instead 
of regular request/response protocols such as HTTP, the XMPP protocol is widely used, 
but it is important to emphasize that the SAS specification is agnostic regarding the alert 
protocol used. 

The SAS specification has been developed under an Interoperability Experiment. The 
current SAS specification document OGC 06-028r3 is published as a Draft 
Interoperability Program Report. 
 

5.4.8 Sensor Planning Service (SPS)  [OGC 05-089r3] 

The Sensor Planning Service (SPS) is intended to provide a standard interface to 
collection assets (i.e., sensors, and other information gathering assets) and to the support 
systems that surround them. Not only must different kinds of assets with differing 
capabilities be supported, but also different kinds of request processing systems, which 
may or may not provide access to the different stages of planning, scheduling, tasking, 
collection, processing, archiving, and distribution of requests and the resulting 
observation data and information that is the result of the requests. The SPS is designed to 
be flexible enough to handle such a wide variety of configurations. The SPS interface 
supports operations needed to determine the feasibility of a collection request, submit a 
collection request, determine the status of a collection request, cancel a collection request 
and change the parameters of a previously submitted request.  The SPS interface also 
exposes the operations necessary to discover the schema associated with the other 
operations.  The SPS is used in conjunction with the WNS and SOS.  When a user 
submits a collection request they must provide a notification target or WNS.  Once the 
collection has occurred a notification will be sent to the notification target.  The user 
would then use a SOS to retrieve the results.   

In May 2007, the SPS specification document OGC 05-089r3 is expected to be released 
as an Implementation Specification. 

5.4.9 Web Notification Service (WNS)  [OGC 06-095] 

As services become more complex, basic request-response mechanisms need to contend 
with delays/failures. For example, mid-term or long-term transactions demand functions 
to support asynchronous communications between a user and the corresponding service, 
or between two services, respectively. A Web Notification Service (WNS) is required to 
fulfill these needs within the SWE framework.  

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  39
 



OGC 07-009r3 

The WNS Model includes two different kinds of notifications. First, the “one-way-
communication” provides the user with information without expecting a response. 
Second, the “two-way-communication” provides the user with information and expects 
some kind of asynchronous response. This differentiation implies the differences between 
simple and sophisticated WNS. A simple WNS provides the capability to notify a user 
and/or service that a specific event occurred. In addition, the latter is able to receive a 
response from the user.  

The basis on which notifications will be sent is defined by the service and will be 
described in its capabilities. The “way-of-notification” palette may include:  

• e-mail 
• HTTP POST: in case of sophisticated clients that act as web services themselves 
• SMS  
• Instant Message  
• phone call  
• letter 
• fax  

 
Once a client registers itself, along with the method of notification desired, the client 
receives a unique RegistrationID that can then be provided as input to other services (e.g. 
SPS or SAS). 
 
The WNS specification document OGC 06-095 was approved for release as an OGC Best 
Practices Paper in December 2006. 
 
5.4.10 Sensor Web Registry  

A Sensor Web Registry is implemented using an OGC Catalog Service backed up by an 
ebRIM/ebXML engine. This service provides discovery capability throughout the whole 
sensor web infrastructure. Typical requests to this service are ‘GetRecords’ operations 
containing filtering parameters used to search a database for one or more matching 
objects of interest. These objects include SWE services (as well as other OGC services), 
sensor descriptions, process chains and dictionary entries such as phenomena or units, 
etc. 

In order to be able to insert objects to a Catalog, each object type must be defined by a 
schema and a CSW harvest profile. This profile shall define what information needs to be 
parsed out of the object XML and advertised as searchable content.  

The following table shows what data can be mined from different XML documents used 
through the SWE framework:

SWE components depend on and extend core elements defined by the OGC’s GML 
conceptual model and schema. All components of the SWE Information Model, including 
the top-most application layer, use these common components.  The swe:DataDefinition 
and swe:Data components, defined in the SWE Common schema, specify common ways 
in which data values are described, encoded and used as process inputs, parameters and 
observation results.  SensorML, O&M, SOS and SPS also use other GML elements such 
as gml:EngineeringCRS, gml:FeatureType and gml:Location.  

5.4.11 Applicability to NSG 

The SWE specifications are well suited for enabling efficient information collection, 
acquisition and management with in the NSG.  SPS can serve as a standard interface that 
facilitates the optimization of available collection resources against user defined 
collection tasks.  This is accomplished by having collection request submitted through a 
common SPS that can act as a central or distributed interface.  This common interface 
allows request to be submitted, managed and scheduled in a regular manner regardless of 
the underling platform or sensor system.   The service based interoperability provided by 
SPS supports fulfilling users’ temporal and spatial needs by synchronizing Multi-INT 
collection activities with DoD elements and other national security community 
components.  This common interface also supports the coordination of collection 
capability planning by providing a standard means to assess the feasibility of a request 
and submit a request.  A cascading SPS can be implemented to manage tasking and 
planning of multiple systems. 

42 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

SOS and SAS provide a common means by which different domains, service branches 
and agencies can provide notification of data availability and data access.  This enables 
the leveraging of GEOINT data collection across a wider community (operational forces, 
homeland security and other operations).  The SAS interface allows users to create 
standing queries in a platform independent way that can be federated across multiple 
systems.  SOS provides a specialized interface which enables access to sensor data once 
it becomes available.  These two interfaces used together constitute an interoperable data 
notification and data access tier that can facilitate inter-system data sharing and improve 
collection system responsiveness. 

SWE provides an efficient means to incorporated foreign, commercial or partner sensor 
data into the NSG.  Any system implementing the SWE standards can be accessed 
without the need for application customization. Provided that the necessary interfaces are 
provided by participating organizations, external data sources and sensors can be 
accessed using the same SWE interfaces.  This means that an organization could use the 
same interfaces to access external and internal sensor resources.  This would improve the 
efficiency of an organization by avoiding constrained vertical systems with ill defined 
and/or proprietary interfaces.  SWE’s focus on interoperability allows new sensors and 
sensor systems to be easily integrated into existing SWE compliant systems. 

The broad range of capabilities defined in SWE enables a degree of automation.  An in-
situ sensor observation with a reading above a predefined threshold could act as an event 
that initiates the tasking of a sensor that can assist in collecting more detailed data. This 
process could enable automated cross-queuing or machine-driven tasking through the use 
of SOS, SAS, SensorML chain and SPS.  SWE could also be used to enable other 
predictive, dynamic, integrated, and persistent sensor capabilities across the NSG, 

SWE's sensor model is sophisticated enough to support encoding of all the parameters 
necessary for characterizing complex imaging devices such as those on orbiting earth 
imaging platforms.  ISO and OGC have cooperated to develop two ISO standards that are 
relevant to the SWE effort: ISO 19130 Geographic Information – Sensor and Data Model 
for Imagery and Gridded Data and ISO 19101-2 Geographic Information – Reference 
Model – Imagery (OGC abstract Specification, Topic 7). OGC’s SWE specifications will 
be key parts of an integrated framework for discovering and interacting with Web-
accessible sensors and for assembling and utilizing sensor networks on the Web. 

5.5 GeoProcessing Workflow (GPW) for the NSG 

The OGC community has accumulated a significant body of knowledge in designing, 
building and operating Web Services. The full potential of Web Services as an integration 
framework will be achieved only when applications and business processes are able to 
integrate their complex interactions by using a standard process integration approach. The 
OASIS Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL-WS or BPEL) 
formally describes a business process that will take place across Web Services in such a 
way that any cooperating entity can perform one or more steps in the process the same 
way. OGC’s Geo-Processing Workflow (GPW) activities develop and demonstrate how 
to interconnect geoprocesses through publish-find-bind and the use of BPEL to meet 

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  43
 



OGC 07-009r3 

workflow requirements, resulting in the creation of valued-added enterprise systems that 
demonstrate the power of interoperability and service-oriented architectures. 

Earlier OWS activities started investigating geo-processing workflows, in particular the 
OWS-2 Common Architecture work used BPEL and WSDL to implement, test and 
demonstrate OGC Web Services for Image Handling and Decision Support; there, 
initiative participants were able to chain several services using the Oracle BPEL product. 
It was recognized in the subsequent initiative (OWS-3) that workflows were not fully 
engaged. Therefore, there was a desire to focus on workflows in OWS-4, and in 
particular coordinate with specific thematic topics.  Further, it was recognized that 
modifications to existing specifications as well as creation of new specifications might be 
needed to support robust and extensible service chaining. For example, many OGC 
services logically fit at the end of a service chain where operations such as getMap, and 
getFeature return the results of a geospatial process. Support for transactions, portrayal 
and additional processing services are needed to create more comprehensive and robust 
process chains. In OWS-4, transactional capability was added to the WCS and explored 
further with the WFS.  Support for temporal data was investigated in both the WCS and 
WFS. Finally new processing services were built by wrapping an existing image handling 
toolkit behind a Web Processing Service (WPS). 

As part of the workflow activities it was also necessary to develop GML application 
schemas for the NGA data products to be used in the OWS. 

5.5.1 GML application schemas 

Ease of Moving Data.  To support the need for greater timeliness, readiness and 
accessibility of data for analysts and customers, as well as to support collaboration, the 
NSG community will require a robust net-centric environment that capitalizes on the 
capabilities afforded by evolving e-business technologies.   Future technologies, greater 
network speed and flexibility, and improved network security will enhance analytic 
information generation and secure data sharing across security domains.  Community-
funded networks will link, and web services will act upon, GEOINT data that is 
organized for community-wide access and sharing, using community-vetted data 
models and standards.

OGC 07-009r3 

Discussion of applying OGC specifications to meet NSG objectives 

Application schemas based on OGC’s Geography Markup Language Version 3.2 
(GML3) were developed as part of OWS-4 to test the feasibility of GML3 to encode 
NGA data and serve as a standards-based vector data transfer format. This work built 
upon earlier OWS efforts that utilized GML2 application schemas and data instances.  

This section describes the development of GML3 and UML application schemas to 
support the NSG Feature Catalog (NSG FC), NGA’s Mission Specific Data (MSD) as 
well as NGA’s Aeronautical data content to support Vertical Obstructions (VOs), Stereo 
Airfield Collection (SAC) and Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) 
data. 

Note: The term NSG Feature Catalog (NSG FC) was originally used to denote the source 
of the information that fed into the application schema development process. The NSG 
FC contains much more information than is described in ISO 19110, and therefore the 
use of the term was not appropriate in the context of application schema development 
process. The term "GEOINT Structure Implementation Profile" (GSIP) will be used when 
referring to the inputs of the schema development process. The term  NSG FC will only 
be use when actual Feature Catalog is referenced. 

Mapping an ISO 19100 UML Application Schema to a GML Application Schema 
Various OWS activities have lead into the development and refinement of the XMI-based 
UML-to-GML-Application-Schema (UGAS) conversion tool "ShapeChange.” (see: 
http://www.ogcnetwork.net/ugas ). The tool has been updated several times through 
experience in OWS-2 and OWS-3 initiative. Most recently in OWS-4 the tool was 
upgraded to support GML 3.2 application schemas.  The process is described graphically 
in the figure 11 below.

For NSG application schemas can be created based on product profiles derived from the 
GSIP. The schemas developed thus far (as part of OWS4) include Local MSD prototype, 
and DAFIF. The product profiles are all strict subsets of the GSIP, which is based on the 
NSG FC as the common feature Catalog for NGA data (and the GKB).  A GML 3.2 
encoding of the entire NSG FC is also part of the OWS-4 deliverables. 

Schemas include metadata based on the requirements of the DDMS 1.3 and ISO TC/211-
19139. Schemas are capable of addressing the following requirements for:  

1. Attributes with complex data types -- the value of an attribute may be a complex 
multi-field data structure, including a list or array of values or structures. 

2. Both entities/classes and data types may reference other entities/classes through 
associations with cardinalities and optional ordering. 

3.  Entities/classes that have no geometry, although all entities/classes are associated 
in some way to an entity/class that does have geometry. 

4. Entities/classes that may have many geometries, including many uses of the same 
geometry, simultaneously. 

5. Temporal requirements.

OGC 07-009r3 

The following outlines the high-level status and decisions of the GSIP based application 
schema developments in OWS-4. . 

 NGA updated the OWS-3 scripts to create a Rose UML model from the GSIP or one of 
the derived product profiles.  A mapping was specified from the GSIP metamodel to the 
UML application schema taking the ISO 191xx rules and the GML application schema 
derivation into account.  

The GSIP identifies a whole series of feature level metadata. This will be captured within 
the schema as metadata not as feature attribution. 

The ShapeChange UGAS tool was updated as required to address all information 
encoded in the UML model and the target GML version of GML 3.2.1. 

A GML profile for GSIP was created and documented (as part of the Interoperability 
Program Reports). 

An initial version of GSIP as a UML application schema is available at 
http://www.nga.mil . 

A version of the GSIP including the Aero information is available. 

The goal is to go from the GSIP profiles to the GML application schemas in a fully 
automated way. This will likely occur in iterations over the OWS-4 period to identify 
issues and improve the process and the resulting schemas. 

Schema metadata to be published in the OWS-4 Catalogs for every schema needs 
additional work. In OWS-3 DDMS 1.2 metadata for application schemas and feature 
types was created. OWS-4 was based on DDMS 1.3 and include more resources, details 
about the resource descriptions are in the process of being specified. 

The following IPRs document the complete activity in detail: 

1. OWS-4 GSIP Schema processing IPR: Update of the OWS-3 IPR based on the 
mapping rules from the GSIP metamodel 

2. Local MSD Data Content Specification IPR: Target a data product specification 
as far as the MSD can provide the contents 

3. AIXM mapping IPR: Documentation of the AIXM mapping to DAFIF.

producers, at all required security levels.  Develop strategies and methods for addressing 
the exponential increase in data and information to ensure that all relevant data is

GEOINT ANALYTIC INFORMATION GENERATION MODEL IN 2015:  FUNCTIONS 
AND TECHNOLOGY LEVELS   
The analytic information generation process model in 2015 will include four information 
generation functions that will occur on three technology levels.    
• Information generation - 1) extraction, 2) fusion, 3) analysis and 4) production  
• These functions will occur across three levels of technology:  1) fully human 
information generation, 2) tool-assisted information generation, and 3) fully automated 
information generation. 
 

Workflow Management.   NSG components will use a set of interoperable workflow 
management, supply-chain management, and decision- support software applications to 
coordinate information generation, storage, and transport activities within the NSG and 
across the broader national security community.  Workflow management will ensure 
tasks are addressed to the proper locations.  Workflow management capabilities will 
facilitate analysts’ ability to more quickly acquire stored data and analysis support 
materials as well as request new collection.  Workflow management will also notify 
customers of the scheduling or executing of data collection or storage retrieval actions.  
Advanced automated security features will protect sensitive information while allowing 
appropriate selective access by any national security community member or customer.  

Applicable OGC Specifications and developments 

• WPS specification (05-007) 

• Web Coordinate Transformation Service (WCTS) (05-013) 

• Topology Quality Assessment (07-007r1) 

• Web Processing Service IPR (06-182) 

• WCS-T IPR (06-098) 

• OWS-4 Workflow IPR (06-187r1) 

The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) can be configured to offer any sort of GIS 
functionality to clients across a network, including access to pre-programmed 
calculations and/or computation models that operate on spatially referenced data. A WPS 
may offer calculations as simple as subtracting one set of spatially referenced numbers 
from another (e.g., determining the difference in influenza cases between two different 
seasons), or as complicated as a global climate change model. The data required by the 
WPS can be delivered across a network, or available at the server. (OGC 05-007r4) 

Note: The Web Processing Service (WPS) was originally named Geoprocessing Service 
(OGC document number 04-043)

OGC 07-009r3 

From the NSG perspective the WPS offers an option for “wrapping” legacy toolsets and 
applications such as GEOTRANS, a NGA application which converts geographic 
coordinates among a wide variety of coordinate systems, map projections, and datums.  
GEOTRANS could be ported to a WPS wrapped application which would provide a well 
documented, tested, standards-based web interface. This interface specification provides 
mechanisms to identify the spatially-referenced data required by the calculation, initiate 
the calculation, and manage the output from the calculation so that it can be accessed by 
the client. This WPS is targeted at processing both vector and raster data. 

In the most recent OWS initiative several WPS profiles were tested, including: a 
Generalization Processing Service, GML Feature Fusion Service, Binary Grid Processing 
Service (Observation Driven Processing Service), and a Feature Clipping Service.  Also, 
OWS4 demonstrated the wrapping of the open-source GRASS GIS and Image Processing 
package into the OGC WPS.  An alternative to wrapping a legacy application in the OGC 
WPS is to use the W3C WSDL/SOAP/UDDI/BPEL based approach. George Mason 
University performed this work and already created a SOAP-based chainable web service 
around GRASS to construct the value-added service chain. Modifications to the SOAP 
wrapping were necessary since the OGC WPS specification has some differences from 
W3C WSDL/SOAP/UDDI/BPEL web service standards. The GMU work, detailed in 
OWS-4 Workflow IPR (06-187r1), shows an example of both approaches.   

The data reduction example shown below in figure 12 was intend to meet a use case 
where a user requires a small sub-set of data due to limited bandwidth or processing 
limitations.  Data from the “Gold” database is generalized (thinned) and clipped to a 
specific area of interest before delivery to a user constrained by low bandwidth.  This 
process is automated through the use of a BPEL workflow.

remote analyst in the field that had to be quality checked with a topological quality 
assessment service before applying the feature transactions to the database. This 
workflow demonstrates the verification of a certain level of data quality requirements 
against a “value-added” data submission prior to its being accepted in to the “gold” 
database.  In this case the data extraction was verified for topological consistency through 
the Topology Quality Assessment Service (TQAS).  If errors were found the data could 
be cleaned up by NGA analysts working in the temporary “silver” database.  Once 
verified as clean the data could then be processed in to the gold database.

Figure 16 - TQAS Workflow 

Both these workflows are fully discussed in the OWS4 Workflow IPR (06-187r1) and are 
intended to show some simple examples of the types of processing and exploitation 
services applicable to NSG.  

The purpose of building the Topology Quality Assessment Service (TQAS) was to 
discover the extent to which it is possible to express, measure and record results of 
executing these logical consistency rules on features within a Web Services environment. 

TQAS has been implemented as a number of stateful web services each of which manage 
a distinct set of entities within the system, such as datastores or rules. In each case, the 
service has been exposed using a standardized SOAP binding with request/response 
messages in RPC/literal form. In addition, for the benefit of clearer demonstration, a thin, 
javascript, browser-based client was written to facilitate interaction with each of the 
service components. 

Each data store has two schema mappings associated with it – one input and one output. 
Output mapping is not needed if TQAS is being used only for checking rules without 
changing data. It is also possible to input from one store and output to a different store. 
TQAS also provides integrated support for externally defined ontologies which describe 
the structure of the data in a specific data store. This is achieved by interfacing with the 
open source Jena ontology library (see http://jena.sourceforge.net/), allowing ontologies 
in various formats such as RDF and OWL to be read into TQAS and used for rules 
authoring and rules-based reasoning.

OGC 07-009r3 

A rule is a logical expression which can be used to test the logical consistency of a 
feature. The rule is expressed using a rules language which is an XML encoding of first 
order logic, incorporating binary predicates ( Boolean operators) for scalar comparisons 
such as greater or less than and also testing spatial relationships such as containment or 
within distance. Rules are managed within TQAS by a dedicated web service – the TQAS 
RuleManager Service. This service allows rule expressions, along with suitable metadata, 
to be stored and their definitions retrieved and used within conformance checking and 
data reconciliation tasks.  

During OWS-4 the TQAS was demonstrated, the browser-based TQAS Client application 
was used to instruct the TQAS Server to access the schema of a remote WFS-T and select 
the relevant feature types and attributes for validation. Shared access to the MSD3 feature 
data was provided by a single WFS-T. These features were updated using a transactional 
WFS-T update client. Modifications included changes to the Runway and Aerodrome 
feature types which have a specific set of constraints mandated by the MGCP Semantic 
Information Model.  A rule conformance validation session was created using the TQAS 
client, nominating the WFS-T as the feature source and indicating a predefined set of 
aeronautical validation rules from the Multi-Global Co-production (MGCP) working 
group. The TQAS client was used to execute the conformance checking session on the 
TQAS server, to monitor progress of the session and display the conformance result via 
the browser.  The aeronautical rules from MGCP expressed abstractly in TQAS’s rules 
language were capable of applying this abstract knowledge to concrete feature data 
obtained via the WFS and return pertinent data quality information to the user updating 
the data in a fully location transparent way. 

5.5.3 Imagery handling 

Accelerate the standardization of sensor data, metadata, compression formats, and file 
identifiers.  Integrate airborne with NTM and other sources.  [Excerpt from NSG 
Statement of Strategic Intent] 

The number of remote imaging sensors being deployed is increasing each year.  The 
fidelity and resolution of the imagery being collected is also increasing dramatically.  
Managing the collection and dissemination of the ever-larger volumes of digital imagery 
can be daunting.  Sorting through the collected data to find information of interest to a 
particular need is time-consuming.  In a world where a single digital image can be 
multiple gigabytes in size, significant time delays can result as large files are exchanged 
across networks having various bandwidth capabilities.  Often an entire file must be 
downloaded when the user needs only a small portion (region of interest) from the 
imagery coverage. Enter the JPIP… [Excerpt from Geospatial Intelligence Standards; 
Enabling a Common Vision]

The OGC image handling services were first demonstrated in OWS1.2 (See: OGC 04-
052). Early efforts specified the requirements for both the image archive and catalog 
services. Later work refined development of the Web Coverage Service (WCS) and 
developed associated imaged processing services as part of image processing workflows.

The WCS is now part of SDI 1.0 as is the ISO JPEG 2000 (JP2) standard 
(http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000). The JP2 standard is a wavelet based encoding for 
imagery that provides the ability to include XML data for description of the image within 
the JPEG 2000 data file. The most recent OWS activity extended version 1.0 of the WCS 
specification to add support for returning coverage data formatted in the JP2 format, both 
as a static image and as a JPEG 200 Interactive Protocol (JPIP) stream, encoded using the 
GMLJP2 standard. 

The JP2 image format has several advantages over other file formats such as GeoTIFF, 
including: image data can be compressed to a high degree while still remaining visually 
lossless; arbitrary sub-scenes can be extracted from the entire image; image data can be 
extracted at various resolutions (scales). Furthermore, JP2 is well suited for the sort of 
large-scale imagery demands typically required to conduct NGA’s mission.  However, 
JP2 does not a natively support geo-referencing or other forms of geospatial metadata.  
For this reason, OGC worked to create a standard specification (GMLJP2) to describe the 
method of using GML within JP2 images for geographic imagery 

52 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 

http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000


OGC 07-009r3 

(http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gmljp2). The GMLJP2 specification defines 
the: 

1. Specification of the uses of GML within JPEG 2000 data files. 
2. Packaging mechanisms for including GML within JPEG 2000 data files. 
3. Specific GML application schemas to support the encoding of OGC coverages 

within JPEG 2000 data files. 
 

While JP2 encoding greatly compresses the size of imagery files, a single image used by 
a GeoINT analyst can still be several gigabytes in size.  These very large file sizes make 
it prohibitive to provide complete image files to the large numbers of users that are 
potentially made available through a net-centric distributed environment. NGA estimates 
that there are 100,000s of extended information users and operators that would benefit 
from access to this imagery, but that are constrained in terms of bandwidth and 
computing resources to exploit these images. (Geospatial Intelligence Standards: 
Enabling a Common Vision, November 2006, p.15) 

The JPIP portion of the JP2 standard (JPIP is part nine of the JPEG 2000 standard) 
addresses the bandwidth and computational constraint that affect delivery of JP2 data. 
(http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000/j2kpart9.html) 

JPIP can interactively access and deliver portions of a JP2 image in essentially arbitrary 
order, in response to real-time application requests. Typical user actions like zooming and 
panning are supported dynamically over the network without the need to download the 
entire image from the repository. The dynamic efficiency enabled by JPIP allows 
significant savings of bandwidth, reduces computer processing and storage requirements 
on both the server and client, and dramatically improves the timely access to the relevant 
portions of the collected data. While important to the strategic networks, deployment of 
JPIP will also give tremendous mileage to the bandwidth-constrained nature of the 
tactical, warfighting environments. (Geospatial Intelligence Standards p.15). 

The power of standards is often magnified when they are combined as building blocks in 
larger systems providing more complete capabilities.  Figure 18 below describes the use 
of JPIP in a WCS implementation delivering GMLJP2 imagery.

5.5.4 GeoSemantics and GEOINT knowledge base 

 

• The GEOINT Knowledge Base.  The GEOINT knowledge base will be a virtual 
repository, encompassing all GEOINT information maintained at the regional data 
centers, as well as providing transparent interface to databases maintained by the various 
NSG members and other partner data repositories.  The knowledge base will be key to 
supporting analytic information generation activities in a unified operating environment 
and furthers the integrated information environment.  There will be access to data across 
security and communication domains.  The GEOINT knowledge base will provide the 
foundational base for reference, positioning, comparison, and visualization, as well as the 
contextual base for in-depth analysis of intelligence issues.  GEOINT knowledge base 
content will include the tools and data frameworks required to use the knowledge base 
effectively.  These will include symbology frameworks, a data dictionary, thesauri, 
taxonomies, ontologies, conceptual models, a feature catalog, robust catalog services 
using comprehensive metadata, information views including templates and recipes 
for queries and view generation, and standard product templates.

5.5.4.2 Discussion of applying OGC specifications to meet NGA objectives 

OGC services, by enabling the Geospatial Web, have made an immense variety of 
localized and specialized geospatial information and concepts accessible with one or two 
mouse clicks. The farther that information and services travel from their origin, though, 
the less likely it is that remote users will also have access to the local context in which to 
find, evaluate, and interpret such resources. The success of syntactically interoperable 
Web services connections has created significant semantic gaps in what can be utilized. 
Both users and their client software may lack the tools to work with the diverse 
information which Geospatial Web standards have made nominally obtainable. 

Semantic technology seeks to make the meaning as accessible as the material, by 
enabling connections– which are both logical and (machine) actionable–between 
concepts which a user presently understands and those which may be new and foreign. 
The Geosemantics extends this capability to both content and concepts which are 
specifically spatial, temporal, and geographic in nature, giving both people and machines 
true access to a wider range of knowledge. The GEOINT Knowledge Base describes a 
goal in which a diverse range of information is joined together by a maximal variety of 
connections which computers can assist users to traverse, regardless of the physical 
location or originating community of a particular piece of information. 

Aspects of work with OGC specifications which support development of the Knowledge 
Base include: 

• Development / encoding of formal, connected, and machine-processable 
geospatial ontologies, including feature type descriptions; 

• Geospatial service capabilities formulated in the OWL-S and other semantic 
expression languages which reference those ontologies; 

• Geospatial service profiles which operate on requests for ontologically expressed 
service and content descriptions; 

• Semantic query language processing interfaces for WFS, FE and other OGC 
services which operate on combinations of the above ontologies, service 
information and queries; 

• Processes for discovering semantically expressed geospatial information and 
services; including use of the CS/W ebRIM metamodel to store ontologies and to 
express classifications and associations of geospatial resource descriptions and 
artifacts.

Figure 19 - Four roles and their relationships comprising a basic SSOA (Semantic Service-oriented

Applications of OGC services are generally focused around the concept of a service-
oriented architecture, in which service consumers bind dynamically to useful instances of 
standard services through a process of service discovery. This process is usually 
facilitated through a trading component, which may be represented by an OGC catalog. 

Semantic interoperability across the Knowledge Base introduces a new requirement, 
since merely discovering and binding to useful geospatial information resources may not 
be sufficient for effectively exploiting them. A broker function is often required, which is 
able to perform semantic translation from the knowledge context in which the resource 
was created, into the context of the GEOINT user who may be widely separated in both a 
physical and intellectual sense from that resource. This broker function may be 
implemented as a catalog ordering operation and/or through schema translation 
performed by a Web Feature Server. 

Multiple ontologies 

An essential aspect of the GEOINT Knowledge Base, as a distributed system serving 
multiple information communities, is the use of multiple ontologies or distinct 
representations of bodies of knowledge. There is no single harmonized and integrated 
ontology representing all human knowledge of the world (as yet). The Knowledge Base

must leverage OGC concepts, services and encodings to manage multiple ontologies 
which are distinct yet spatially, temporally, and conceptually overlapping.

Just as the communities they represent remain separate but overlapping, so these 
ontologies are expected to maintain separate identities but be linked (e.g. via subsumption 
or mapping) into a knowledge base (either physical or virtual) capable of providing 
answers to cross-domain queries. 

5.6 Geo-Decision Support Services (GeoDSS) for NSG  

5.6.1 Integrated information environment and OWS portal architecture 

Multiple levels of service will be available to answer the GEOINT portion of customer 
information needs.  NSG data holdings will be managed dynamically in a manner to 
facilitate content reuse and customization of GEOINT.  Customers will have universal 
access to these data holdings at the NSG level through a web-enabled standardized 
enterprise portal, providing a one- stop point of access.  GEOINT portal operations will 
be characterized by use of:  
•  Data standards, metadata tagging, and data at multiple levels of security and 
releasability,  
•  Tools that support data discovery and data mining,  
•  Shared, common services designed to operate as part of a larger national security 
community repository,  
•  Interfaces to other NSG, DoD, IC, commercial, and academic portals, and  
•  Enhanced bandwidth.  
 

•  An Integrated Information Environment.  Information management and sharing across

the NSG are disconnected among intelligence disciplines and national, theater, and 
tactical levels, and do not provide horizontal integration.  By 2015, the nation must have 
an integrated information environment, requiring comprehensive capabilities for 
information generation and management.  Initiatives critical to providing a fully 
integrated and agile approach for sharing collection and analytic resources and 
exchanging GEOINT across the enterprise must be given programmatic priority.  In 
addition to information generation and information management capabilities, a 
horizontally integrated information environment will require standards, 
interoperability, and data sharing.

5.6.1.2 Discussion of applying OGC specifications to meet NGA objectives 

The concept of a single portal is one that is falling out of favor as the industry’s 
experience with deploying Web services in large organizations, and even more so in 
multi-organization contexts, evolves. We are moving towards envisioning systems of 
systems, or dynamic information sharing architectures that allow individual agencies and 
departments to leave and join information networks as required by organizational and 
operational needs. That being said, the flexibility of a Web services-based architecture, 
and OGC’s expression of that architecture in its geospatial services, is well equipped to 
evolve along these lines.

Figure 21 - OWS Portal Reference Architecture 

With that theoretical background, we can still talk about a portal architecture as one 
instance of an infrastructure that may actually be more dynamic in nature than is initially 
envisioned. The backbone of a portal infrastructure, as it relates to decision support, is the 
ability to quickly and accurately discover geospatial services and data, allowing an 
analyst to make highly informed decisions. This requirement is supported by the OGC’s 
work on catalogs, which is fulfilled by the OpenGIS® Catalog Service Implementation 
Specification (CSW) along with the profiles of CSW mentioned above. The OGC catalog 
work specifies the way in which catalog servers can collect, or “harvest”, information 
about geospatial feature data, imagery and symbology, as well as map services. These 
information access standards are listed above. Catalog servers can share and aggregate 
this information using a catalog-to-catalog harvesting interface. Clients can exploit 
catalogs by using their query interface. 

A key layer of this information discovery work is security—access rights, authentication 
and encryption. This requirement has been taken up by the OGC in recent years. While it 
is still an emerging area of work, the theoretical foundation for robust digital rights 
management has been laid, and operational services are being prototyped. The relevant 
documents are listed above. 

5.6.2 Integrated client 

There will be a significant increase in available data and data types.  The greater 
volumes, varieties, and velocities of information in the future, when combined with 
nontraditional and asymmetric threats, will challenge our ability to extract relevant data 
to support leaders, policymakers, war fighters and other customers with timely, accurate, 
and current GEOINT.  For example, there will be more dwell capability by 2015.  This 
capability will be enhanced through use of new collection platforms and several emerging

OGC 07-009r3 

intelligence applications (e.g., full motion video, Surface Moving Indicator (SMTI)) and 
will require comprehensive capabilities to manage analytic information generation.  
There will also be more GEOINT-related SIGINT and HUMINT.  Effective use of new 
collection capabilities will require the establishment of comprehensive reference 
databases holding of a variety of information.  The NSG ability to handle this increase 
of information will depend on an integrated information environment with 
improved models for generating and managing information, improved horizontal 
integration, standards, and a converged architecture, as described below.  

The core purpose of an integrated client is to provide a unified environment that allows a 
user to visualize, analyze, and/or edit data from feature, imagery, video and sensor web 
data sources within a single client. Within the context of the OGC, this means that the 
integrated client allows a user to publish, discover, access, integrate and apply all types of 
spatial data (e.g., raster, vector, coverages and sensor observations) from a wide range of 
vendor “web services” through OGC standard interfaces. 

The speed and ease with which information can be integrated and bought to bear on a 
problem may be as important as the information available for analysis. In order to 
facilitate this process, OGC has done work on standardizing the way in which service 
access points are stored, or to use a term borrowed from Web browsers, “bookmarked”. 
This work started with Web Mapping services with the WMS Context standard. A WMS 
Context document is an XML file that describes one or more WMS services, their layer 
ordering, their styles, and optionally a geographic viewing extent. The functionality 
proved popular and it is being expanded in OWS Context to support all OGC’s data 
access and symbology standards. Context documents allow an analyst to save the state of 
their visualization efforts to quickly restart where they left off, or share the Context with 
a colleague. 

5.6.2.1 Applicable OGC specifications and developments 

• Web Map Context Documents Implementation Specification (WMS Context, 05-
005) 

• Web Map Context Documents Implementation Specification (05-005) 

• Geographic Objects Implementation Specification (GeoAPI, 03-064) 

5.6.2.2 Discussion of applying OGC specifications to meet NGA objectives 

GeoAPI aims to increase the speed and quality of Java and C++ client development work 
around OGC standards. OGC implementation specifications are built around the platform 
and language-neutral Web services stack of technologies. However, applications must be 
developed in a specific language, leaving many degrees of freedom—and room for 
error—in the software development process. GeoAPI addresses this concern by 
specifying a standard set of client interfaces for consuming OGC Web services, adding 
one more layer of quality assurance to the process.

OGC 07-009r3 

The functionality of an integrated client can be divided into the following five categories:  

• Service Discovery & Binding  
• Feature Production  
• Imagery Production/Exploitation  
• Sensor Web Planning/Exploitation  
• Project Persistence and Sharing  
 

For each integrated client, the implementation must harness specific technologies and 
adopt particular architectural approaches. Each technology/architecture pairing presents 
different reliability, availability, serviceability, usability, security, and performance 
characteristics. And as such, different technology/architecture pairings may be more or 
less suitable for various purposes across an enterprise.  

Service Discovery & Binding 

A service registry is a software component that supports the run-time discovery and 
evaluation of available service offerings. The Service Discovery & Binding functionality 
of the integrated client provides, as a minimum, a tool for finding data and services by 
querying service registries.  

There are a number of existing service registries in use, and as the number of available 
registries grows it will become increasingly difficult for users to find all the possible data 
of interest and choose the best data for the task at hand. The functionality provided by the 
integrated client is intended to assist the user in maintaining persistent knowledge of a set 
of service registries, executing queries against these registries, and creating service chains 
to provide discovered data to the client in the desired form.  

The Service Discovery & Binding functionality can be divided into the following 5 
functions:  

A) Registering a service to a Service Registry   

Once geospatial data is published in an OGC web service instance (W*S), its 
presence must be announced so that geospatial data analysts can find it. A geospatial 
data provider can do this by using an integrated client to register the service with a 
catalog. A URL endpoint pertaining to the service is sent the catalog service. When 
the catalog receives the request, it then queries the W*S service for its capabilities.  

B) Querying a Service Registry for OGC Web Services.  

A geospatial analyst must be able to locate OGC Web Services. The analyst can use 
an integrated client to query a Catalog Service – Web (CS-W) for available services 
based on location and other parameters. The CS-W returns an XML document 
containing capability metadata for the available services. The client should present 
these results in such a way that the analyst could select a specific service and view its 
capabilities.  

62 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

C) Querying a Service Registry for data layers.  

Service registries not only contain information on the services registered, they also 
contain metadata on the data layers contained by each service. A geospatial analyst 
can query a registry using an integrated client to discover not only services but also 
data layers. The client retrieves metadata for these layers from the service registry so 
that the analyst can filter the results in order to find available data that meets time-of-
collection and data quality requirements.  

D) Assembling Service Chains to provide data layers for the client.  

Integrated clients, no matter how complex, will never be able to render every 
possible data source. Therefore, additional services may be required to generate an 
appropriate data layer. The client can be used to discovery additional data 
transformation and portrayal services that can be chained together to produce a data 
layer that can be supported.  

E) Managing a collection of Service Registries.  

Instead of querying a specific CS-W, an integrated client could potentially query 
multiple CS-W services simultaneously. This has the potential of increasing the 
breadth of the search, but there are ramifications for performing this operation. Since 
each query returns an XML document which may be quite large, bandwidth 
restrictions may make this operation impractical. There is also the potential for 
retrieving multiple duplicate entries and the complexity of organizing the results 
from multiple servers.  

Imagery Production/Exploitation 

The Imagery Exploitation functionality serves to provide retrieval and viewing of 
imagery. This includes querying for imagery based on geometry and attributes and 
creation of service chains to utilize additional services to render the imagery in a specific 
manner. The user will use this component to find and use imagery data, and then find and 
use imagery application services to operate on the imagery data. The Imagery Production 
functionality requires support of some or all of the following OGC interfaces: WMS, 
WCS, Coverage Portrayal Service (CPS), ICS, and IAS. It can be divided into the 
following 4 functions:  

A) Querying an Imagery Catalog.  

The client must have search tools to specify, find, and retrieve data. The client must 
also provide the user the means to view and interact with the data. The client must 
have tools to select and invoke imagery application services, and to invoke service 
chains (e.g. Image Catalog→Image Archive→Coordinate Transformation 
Service→Web Coverage Service). The client might access map data to depict their 
study area, view imagery footprints from an Image Catalog, select imagery coverage, 
etc. This also involves using Web Map Servers and Web Feature Servers.  

B) Retrieving Imagery from an Imagery Archive.  

Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  63
 



OGC 07-009r3 

The user wants a recent imagery over the disaster area. The user formulates a request 
based upon the well-known Imagery Metadata Model employed by the Image 
Catalog. The user employs the client to access an Image Catalog to find recent 
satellite, aerial and ground imagery of the area. (As described here, the client knows 
about the Image Catalog Service, but the client might also discover this service 
through a service registry that operates as a broker for several Image Catalogs.)  

The user finds the Image Metadata they want through the catalog search and now 
must access the appropriate Imagery Archive Service to fetch the imagery and 
imagery support data. The client formulates the request to the archive, stipulating 
where the data are to be delivered for the client to later exploit. This process might 
take some time, if for example the archive has to fetch the data from tape storage. The 
Imagery Archive Service completes its assignment by delivering the imagery data to 
the appropriate Web address. Optionally, the Imagery Archive Service might employ 
a Notification Service to alert the User about the availability of their requested data. 
The data is now available for exploiting, although it is still in its tiled archive format. 
(The archive service likely supports mosaicing, re-tiling, and re-sampling to deliver 
the imagery in a form that is ready for exploitation.)  

C) Assembling a Service Chain to retrieve raster data from a WCS and 
rendered according to client specified styles and parameters by a CPS.  

D) Local manipulation of imagery (translucency, edge detection, etc.)  

Feature Production 

The Feature Production functionality serves to provide retrieval and viewing of feature 
geometry and attributes, supporting complex querying for features based on geometry 
and attributes, cartographic portrayal of feature data, feature analysis, and feature editing 
capabilities. The Feature Production functionality requires support of one or more of the 
following OGC interfaces: WMS, WFS, FPS, SLD, Style Management Service, and 
Feature Fusion Service. It can be divided into the following 2 functions:  

A) Managing/editing features contained in a WFS-T.  

A Transactional Web Feature Server (WFS-T) allows users to retrieve and modify 
feature data. For example, a geospatial data producer employs recent imagery as a 
source for feature analysis and update. The integrated client employs an Image 
Catalog Service and Image Archive Service to access the imagery. Next, the user 
browses and queries Web Service Registries for feature metadata. The user employs 
this metadata to select the appropriate feature data for use in disaster response. 
Having discovered the appropriate feature data, the client then employs a 
Transactional Web Feature Service (WFS-T) to access the feature data. The client 
then uses feature extraction tools to update the data.  

B) Assembling a Service Chain.

OGC 07-009r3 

The client provides the means to view, filter, and interact with feature data rendered 
according to client-defined styles and client-specified parameters.  

Sensor Web Production 

A number of remote sensors, both in-situ and mobile, are in use today. The data from 
these sensors can be analyzed for their spatial and temporal patterns and visualized 
through maps either statically or via animation. A number of OGC services were created 
to provide a common framework for working with sensors that are connected to the 
Internet. The Sensor Web Exploitation functionality requires support of some or all of the 
following service types: SPS, SOS, WNS. It can be divided into the following 3 
functions:  

A) Retrieving sensor data from a SOS.  

Support for a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) allows users to retrieve data from a 
remote sensor. Sensors may be queried by location, time, and coordinate system. The 
SOS responds to a query with an XML document containing the sensor observation 
data.  

B) Managing a sensor plan through a Sensor Planning Service.  

The Sensor Planning Service (SPS) is used to generate and edit collection plans. Pre-
collection prediction capability is used to help develop the plans required for mobile 
sensors to provide the needed sensor coverage. This service accepts location 
information identifying the region/target of sensor coverage. The prediction capability 
considers the physical environment, communications environment, sensor, and 
platform to determine the relevant area, path, time, duration, and/or similar 
parameters, and acceptable deviations that the platform must take into account to 
correctly position the sensor. In a UAV scenario, the pre-collection prediction 
capability may determine the collection geometry, which may be represented in 2D or 
3D to help identify possible flight area/path, speed, and elevation in a way users can 
insure that the planned sensor flight provides the needed sensor coverage. Displaying 
similar information for a series of regions/targets can help the user identify a 
complete flight circuit appropriate for single sensor collection against multiple 
targets. This service allows a UAV collection plan to be generated and then saved. In 
addition to the flight plan details, corresponding sensor Collection Requests are also 
specified. This information is used to fly the UAV and task the air quality sensor to 
perform collections.  

C) Handling sensor plan notifications from a Web Notification Service.  

When a request is made through an SPS and it is not immediately known whether the 
requested action can be performed, a WNS is used to notify the user that the 
collection has been successful. The user is then free to utilize the SOS functionality to 
retrieve the data.

6 Compliance 

Key consumers in the geospatial industry are modernizing their enterprises based on the 
interoperability of OGC web services and, in particular, the Spatial Data Infrastructure 
(SDI) 1.0 (see http://www.nga.mil/NGASiteContent/StaticFiles/OCR/nga0518.pdf).  
NGA serves the role of functional manager for GEOINT.  SDI 1.0 includes the following 
implementation specifications: WMS, WFS-T, WCS, CS/W, GML, SLD and Context.  
OGC document 06-086 details the specifications and associated version of the SDI suite 
of specifications.  As the OGC web services technology stack has matured, the SDI 1.0 
group of interfaces has emerged representing a baseline of technology needed to 
implement a fully interoperable, end-to-end spatial data infrastructure.  The SDI 1.0 
infrastructure serves in NGA’s mission within the NSG to: 
 
• Firmly establish leadership in providing GEOINT through OGC Web Services 
• Firmly establish leadership in providing browser-based GEOINT analysis and 

visualization  
• Streamline development and deployment while reducing redundancy in data stores 

and web sites 
• Maintain consistency in provisioning and coordination with customers 
 
Major geospatial industry consumers require verifiable proof of compliance with OGC 
specifications.  This is a critical step towards the desirable outcome of interoperability 
that is possible through implementation of the SDI 1.0 web services, which are standards-
based and vendor neutral. 
 
Validating compliance with an OGC specification means verifying that a software 
product has implemented the specification correctly by testing the software interface for 
response and behavior that is outlined in the specification. Verifying compliance to the 
standard is necessary in order to achieve interoperability. As a result, geospatial 
application vendors desire to provide their potential costumers a means to verify 
adherence to OGC standards as a measurable discriminator for the interoperability of 
software products. Vendors can achieve this goal through OGC’s online Compliance Test 
Program, which is described in Section 5.2 below and at 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/testing.   
 
Major geospatial enterprises, like NGA, desire assurance that acquired software 
components will interoperate with their existing investments in geospatial data, 
geospatial systems, and OGC-compliant technology on their own internal networks with 
their own Implementation Profiles and their own specific data sets. Enterprises like NGA 
can expect that vendor products should go through the OGC Compliance Test Program 
and have been certified.  This is only the first step towards creating a truly interoperable 
geospatial enterprise.  NGA should also implement a program, methodology and tools 
which will test compliance with OGC web services inside of NGA networks and with 
unique NGA data and system requirements in mind.

NGA REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLIANCE TESTING OGC WEB SERVICES 

“One of NGA’s obligations as functional manager of 
GEOINT is to ensure that interoperability is achieved 
through standards testing and enforcement.” 

“Working under the guidance of the NGA Chief 
Architect, the NCGIS will establish this environment to 
accomplish two primary goals:  

Ascertain the degree to which architectural design, 
principles, guidelines, concepts and standards, if 
deployed, will satisfy NSG: 

•Functional capability objectives 

•User agency requirements 

•Interoperability criteria 

Validate, establish confidence in, and sustain the 
GEOINT functional manager’s architectural and 
standards guidance to the IC and NSG communities” 

From “Geospatial Intelligence Standards: 
Enabling a Common Vision, Nov 2006” 

 “Implement a compliance program to ensure 
compatibility of industry SCOTS to NSG mandated 
standards.” 

Action ID GC7.1 from Geospatial Standards 
Management Authority Strategic 
Implementation Plan 

 

6.1 Recommendations for NGA Web Services compliance test program  

The following is a list of recommendations for a successful NGA OGC Web Services 
Compliance Test Program 

• NGA should require that vendor products are certified through OGC’s compliance 
test program in order to be implemented on NGA programs 

• NGA should establish an instance of the OGC web services compliance test engine to 
be made available on NGA classified networks and inside of NGA test labs for 
compliance testing of software products developed or tailored for NGA programs and 
to verify that vendor products are configured correctly within those environments. 

o NGA should establish a central authority to coordinate and oversee use and 
results of testing with the OGC web services compliance test engine 

o This instance of the test engine should be made available to the NGA software 
development community on programs like ESP, GSP, SMARTS, and others 
where rapid web services development is required 

o This instance of the test engine should be made available to NGA’s test labs to 
be used prior to deployment of systems based on the OGC Web Services or 
SDI 1.0 specifications 

o This instance of the test engine should be made accessible through the NCGIS 
Standards Knowledge Base; documentation of all testing activities and results

OGC 07-009r3 

should be kept in the SKB; the SKB should also be used as an internal 
collaboration site for NGA development community (staff or contractors) to 
collaborate on any changes desired or made to the web services compliance 
engine 

o NGA should establish an approach to utilize the compliance engine in 
conjunction with interoperability testing events to move towards validating 
interoperability; NGA should require passing the compliance tests as a 
prerequisite for participating in an interoperability event. 

o NGA should consider enhancing the OGC compliance test engine to allow for 
testing web services without reliance on static test data.  This would provide a 
mechanism to test web services implementations serving NGA specific data 
(for example, GGMA data being served through OGC Web Services).  The 
current OGC web services compliance test engine relies on a static test data 
set, which may be limiting for the type of testing NGA will require.  The 
engine could be enhanced to allow for compliance testing against NGA 
specific data and implementation profiles of the services. 

o NGA should consider leading the community in development of an approach 
and technologies for client side OGC Web Services compliance testing.  The 
current OGC Compliance Test Program and associated tools are focused 
entirely on compliance testing server side components.  One element of the 
client side compliance testing may include NGA standing up Reference 
Implementations of server products (described in detail below) on their 
networks against which client tool compliance can begin to be validated. 

• NGA should establish an NGA OGC Web Services Compliance Test  Program Policy 
Document as an element of NGA’s SOA Governance Program  

o NGA should analyze current testing processes and revise where necessary to 
support web services testing in a SOA 

o The OGC Web Services Compliance Engine should be considered one testing 
tool among the other SOA validation tools used within the SOA Governance 
Program 

o NGA should consider utilizing the OGC Web Services Compliance Engine as 
the compliance test engine for testing all NGA Web Services (including non-
OGC web services);  additional test scripts would need to be developed for 
non-OGC web services using the documented Compliance Test Language 
(CTL) written for the OGC Web Services Compliance Engine; the engine is 
open source and can be extended with custom Java programming if necessary 

o NGA should ensure that compliance tests are developed for all of the 
implementation specifications in the SDI 1.0 suite.  As the SDI 1.0 suite 
evolves, it will be necessary for NGA to continue to work with the OGC 

68 Copyright © 2007 Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
 



OGC 07-009r3 

community to mature the state of the Compliance Test Program to include the 
current SDI 1.0 specifications. 

o NGA should nominate a single point of contact to coordinate with OGC to 
update the NGA instance of the compliance engine with any updates released 
by OGC 

o NGA should use the OGC point of contact to ensure no alterations are made to 
OGC approved web services compliance tests; if NGA staff encounter any 
problems with the OGC approved compliance test baseline, the point of 
contact should work with OGC to submit an appeal 

6.2 Compliance testing overview 

OGC Compliance Tests are developed via OGC initiatives typically funded by outside 
sponsors.  A participant is selected to develop a compliance test for a specific OGC 
implementation specification.  The participant first documents an Abstract Test Suite 
(ATS) to indicate what elements of the implementation specification will be tested.  The 
ATS is reviewed by the OGC Technical Committee (TC) community and feedback is 
incorporated into the ATS.  In addition, any ambiguities in the specification are indicated 
and change proposals against those implementation specifications are developed and 
worked through the OGC process as needed.  From the ATS, an Executable Test Suite 
(ETS) is developed.  The ETS runs within the OGC Compliance Test Engine.  The ETS 
is reviewed by the OGC TC and feedback or appeals from the TC are reviewed.  Any 
required changes are incorporated into the ETS.  Reference Implementations (RI) are 
open source implementations of an OGC Web Service which is 100% compliant with the 
associated compliance tests.  RIs are developed in tight conjunction with development of 
the ETS.  The RI development team collaborates closely with the ETS developer to 
ensure that the RI is fully compliant to the ETS.  At the point at which all feedback has 
been incorporated into the ETS and the RI is 100% compliant, the compliance package 
(including the ATS, ETS and RI) are submitted to the OGC Planning Committee (PC) for 
approval as official OGC compliance tests.  The following is a diagram of the previously 
described process.

Upon approval by the PC, compliance tests become part of the official OGC Compliance 
Test Program and are made available via the OGC website 
(http://cite.opengeospatial.org).  The purpose of the OGC Compliance Testing Program is 
to permit vendors and users to take advantage of the standards that OGC has created. The 
program provides a process for testing compliance of products to OpenGIS® 
Implementation Specifications. 

This goal of the compliance testing process is to determine that a product implementation 
of a particular Implementation Specification fulfills all mandatory elements as specified 
and that these elements are operable. Compliance testing may become more stringent 
over time, especially as a particular Implementation Specification matures.

A vender may use OGC's marks (trademarks or certification marks) to indicate to their 
customers that they have achieved compliance with OpenGIS Implementation 
Specifications after completing the following steps: 
 
• Submitting a Candidate Product to OGC’s Compliance Testing Program,  
• Successfully passing compliance testing,  
• Receiving a certificate stating such success,  
• Receiving a fully executed license from OGC to use the trademark, 
• Paying the trademark license fee, and 
• Providing a fully functional, licensed copy of the tested software to OGC. 
 
Compliance testing, in its present phase does not ensure, or even test, interoperability of 
software products. However, as the specifications mature the likelihood of 
interoperability will be higher.

SDI 1.0 identifies a set of interoperable OGC specifications.  For NSG implementation 
purposes the SDI 1.0 will not mandate specification version numbers, the DISR (DoD 
Information Technology Standards and Profile Registry) will identify the specific 
versions mandated for use within the DoD.  There are several criteria for determining 
which specifications are in the SDI.  The criteria include maturity of the implementations 
along with dependencies between the specifications.  Future SDI suites will be identified 
by studying successful implementations and through interoperability test efforts.

As recommended in Section 5.1 above, NGA should require that vendor products be 
certified through OGC’s Compliance Test Program in order to be implemented on NGA 
programs.  This is a first step towards ensuring interoperability when those vendor 
products are implemented.  Beyond that, NGA should adopt the OGC compliance testing 
tools (described in the following section) within the NGA enterprise for additional NGA 
system, implementation, and data specific compliance and interoperability testing. 
Passing a compliance test shows that an implementation has followed the specification; 
this is a step towards ensuring interoperability.  The compliance tests do not fully 
guarantee interoperability - there are other factors like interaction with other 
specifications/services, specific data and installation in user environments that need to be 
"tested" to determine if interoperability has been achieved.  Therefore, recommendations 
were included in Section 6.1 above for NGA to host Interoperability Events, to enhance 
the engine to use dynamic data and to consider client-side compliance testing.

6.3 Compliance testing tools overview 

The following are the elements of the OGC Web Services Compliance Test Program 

COMPONENT DESCRIPTION 

Compliance Test Engine Open Source Test Evaluation And Measurement (TEAM) engine 

Abstract Test Suite 
Testable assertions extracted from specification document; defined as 
mandatory or optional; test cases are specified independently of any particular 
test procedure (ISO 19105, 4.4); may be used to create an ETS for a particular 
test harness 

Executable Test Suite Compliance test which is executed by the Compliance Test Engine 

Compliance Test Language (CTL) 

Compliance Test Language is an XML grammar for documenting and scripting 
suites of compliance tests for verifying that an implementation of a specification 
complies with the specification.  A suite of CTL files is installed in the compliance 
test engine, which executes the scripts and determines whether the 
implementation being tested passes or fails.   

Reference Implementation Open source implementation of an OGC Web Service which is 100% compliant with the associated compliance tests. 

Test Data 
Static dataset provided through OGC test program; loaded into service 
implementation to be tested; this data is necessary for the ETS to test the 
service implementation  

ETS Translator 
Converts OGC compliance tests originally developed for The Open Group 
Engine into CTL and produces wrappers to enable use of TEAM engine custom 
functions and translators 

 

The following sections describe the major software components involved in running 
compliance tests. 

6.3.1 Compliance test engine overview 

As a work item in the OWS4/Conformance and Interoperability Test and Evaluation 
(CITE) project, Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) provided an open 
source web services compliance engine (referred to throughout this section as the OGC 
Compliance Test Engine).  NGIT refers to this engine as the Test Evaluation And 
Measurement (TEAM) Engine.   

6.3.1.1 Compliance test engine technical description 

The TEAM Engine has a web interface (thin client) that runs in Tomcat.  The thin client 
is made available through OGC’s website.  It is also available to be installed on other 
networks with an easy-to-use web interface.  The thick client interface is intended for use 
by developers; it is easy to install and update tests.  The desktop version (thick client) 
runs in a standalone Java environment and does not require setting up a web server.  The 
desktop interface is a basic command line interface with Swing forms.   

This engine is an open source software product, available for download from 
SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/teamengine.

6.3.1.2 Compliance test engine licensing 

TEAM Engine is released under the Mozilla Public License.  No license key is required 
and the source code is publicly available. Test Script developers can modify the engine if 
necessary when developing new Executable Test Scripts.  Configuration management of 
the source code will be managed by the OGC through SourceForge. 

6.3.2 Compliance Test Script Notation Overview 

Compliance Test Language (CTL) is the TEAM Engine script notation.  CTL is based on 
XSL, which allows the use of a full range of looping and decision constructs and variable 
declarations. Extension functions can be written in XSL or Java using integrated Java 
datatypes and standard W3C DOM XML datatypes. Tests can be arranged in a hierarchy, 
allowing reuse of generic tests and reducing the number of times requests must be made 
to the service. These advantages should lead to a flexible, intuitive, open and easy-to-
maintain test scripts. 

6.3.3 Reference implementations 

The development of compliance test suites plays a crucial role in the implementation of 
interoperable Spatial Data Infrastructures. Open Source Reference Implementations 
support this task by “testing the tester” and working as freely available example 
implementations for all kinds of implementers.   
 
OGC has defined a reference implementation as an open source, fully functional 
implementation of a specification in reference to which other implementations can be

evaluated. The OGC provides open source reference implementations for every 
implementation specification that has a compliance test.  This is to ensure maximum 
transparency of its specifications for both vendors and customers. 
 
The following is a list of reference implementations developed as part of the OWS4 
project. Links to the open source software behind these implementations will be available 
through OGC’s website (www.opengeospatial.org) upon approval by the Planning 
Committee.

6.4 Maturing OGC compliance test program for the benefit of the NSG  

Compliance testing of OGC web services is a critical element in the OGC community’s 
ability to release implementable web services specifications.  The process of developing 
compliance tests improves the quality of the implementation specifications by reducing 
ambiguities in the specs.  The process of running executable tests against vendor products 
has proven to be a critical step in interoperability in the marketplace.   

As the NSG rapidly implements the OGC Web Services in the SDI 1.0 suite of 
technologies, the need for a solid web services compliance test program is accentuated.  It 
will be mutually beneficial to NGA, as functional manager for GEOINT, and the OGC 
community to continue to collaborate on tools and approaches for the OGC Compliance 
Test program to ensure that compliance tests are developed for the web services 
implementation specifications that are most critical to the NSG’s Enterprise Architecture.  
In particular, NGA should ensure that there are compliance tests for all of the 
implementation specifications in the SDI 1.0 suite.  In addition, as the OGC community 
adds SOAP and WSDL profiles to the existing RESTful web services, NGA should 
ensure compliance tests are developed quickly so that the NSG can implement these 
services with a high probability of success.

7 Development and governance 

7.1 Standards adoption 

By 2015, interoperability standards will be adopted that enable seamless sharing of 
GEOINT across the NSG, IC and the national security community.  GEOINT will be 
accessed and managed through net-centric operations, using standards in compliance with 
the DoD Net- Centric Data Strategy.  

 

The U.S. national standards strategy encourages development of market supported, 
open, net-centric standards. DoD policy supports the U.S. national standards strategy 
and establishes partnerships with relevant national and international organizations that 
develop and set standards, with the objective of adopting the most cost-effective, 
efficient, and timely commercial standards available to meet DoD needs.  

In addition to establishing standards for use within the NSG, the NCGIS will engage in 
the development of common information handling and management standards that will 
be key to achieving interoperability across the NSG and the national security community.  
These activities will include supporting the selection and/or development and 
implementation of standards associated with workflow management; needs, 
requirement, and task prioritization; decision support applications for automated 
asset allocation; applications for use in accomplishing automated techniques, 
analysis, and fusion of multi-INT and operations data; and the formatting of multi-
INT products resulting from use of these automated exploitation, analysis and 
fusion capabilities.  Also included will be establishing standards for foundation data 
accuracy and new product types, including standards for operations and multi-INT 
information view recipes and information views.

OGC 07-009r3 

As the functional manager for GEOINT, NGA created the Geospatial Intelligence 
Standards Working Group (GWG) in partnership with the Defense Information Systems 
Agency Information Technology Standards Committee. The NCGIS chairs the GWG and 
provides secretariat support. The GWG serves as the community’s advocate for 
information technology standardization activities related to GEOINT.  At the opening 
meeting of the GWG, the keynote speaker, Bobbi Lenczowski, Senior Executive, NGA 
West, highlighted the practical needs and difficulties in achieving standardization and 
recognizing that “…interoperability cannot happen without standards and standards 
agreements. We have an awesome responsibility before us.” 

The GWG is open to all National System for Geospatial-Intelligence personnel interested 
in facilitating the adoption, promulgation and use of GEOINT standards for enabling 
technologies, data architecture and software. 

The GWG serves as the community forum for the coordination of GEOINT standards for 
NSG. The primary responsibilities of the GWG are to 1) coordinate population of the 
DoD IT Standards Registry (DISR) with GEOINT standards and 2) serve as the NSG 
Community of Interest for all standardization activities and functions related to GEOINT.  
The GWG focuses on GEOINT standards that enable interoperability in net- and data-
centric environments and standards that support enabling technologies, data architectures, 
and software tools. 

The GWG has identified OGC specifications among those critical baseline standards that 
the GEOINT community must adopt.  GWG has emphasized critical need for NSG to use 
SCOTS that adhere to the Spatial Data Infrastructure 1.0 Baseline (SDI 1.0).  SDI 1.0 
includes multiple OGC implementation specifications including WMS, WCS, WFS, 
CSW, GML, etc. 

OGC is an Associate Member of the GWG. Associate Members serve as subject matter 
experts and technical advisors to the GWG. 

NGA is a Strategic Member of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Strategic 
Membership is the consortium's highest level of membership, involving significant 
participation in the OGC's Management Committee, Technical Committee and 
Interoperability Program.  

The reason for NGA's continuing participation was explained by Christopher D. Cuppan, 
NSG Chief Architect, Office of Geospatial Intelligence Functional Management, "We at 
NGA share with the OGC a common architectural vision for  'a world in which everyone 
benefits from geographic information and services made available across any network, 
application, or platform.' Our mission, 'Know the Earth, Show the Way,' benefits 
substantially from the work that the OGC has accomplished since its inception, and we 
recognize that increasingly, the future success of the National System for Geospatial 
Intelligence (NSG) is intertwined with the success of the Consortium."  

Strategic membership in OGC allows NGA to direct requirements in the OGC 
Interoperability Program, including requirements for Interoperability Testbeds where 
most OGC Implementation Specifications have originated.

Consistent with their Strategic Membership in OGC, NGA has been a continuing sponsor 
of the OGC Interoperability Program.  The specification resulting from the OGC 
Interoperability Program initiatives have resulted in Adopted OGC Specifications that 
meet NGA and the NSG needs and have been implemented by industry.  The GWG has 
adopted the OGC specifications into the DISR baseline.   

NGA should continue to sponsor OGC testbed and pilot initiatives.  Based upon a review 
of the NSG References for this profile (See section 2.1) a set of potential requirements 
groups for consideration for NGA sponsorship in figure OGC Interoperability Initiatives 
is as follows: 

• Feature Modeling concepts and best practices 

• Knowledge management 

• Fusion of aggregation of observations;  

• Semantic reasoning for data mining;  

• Models to predict observations

• Semantic-enabled Services: how to create valid service chains 

• Decision support: collaborative methods, query & response methods 

8 Summary 

The profile described above meets many of the needs related to the NSG, NGA and other 
large federal organizations.  Topics such as OGC Web Services, Sensor Web 
Enablement, Geo-Processing Workflow, Geo-Decision Support, and Compliance are 
described and integration concepts are also presented.  Although the specifications 
presented here are useful there is need for improvement.  The OGC Web Services test-
bed has served as an efficient means to develop many of the specifications mentioned in 
this profile and will continue to improve the capabilities and relevance of these 
specifications.  Some of the topics currently planned to be addressed in the 2007 test-bed 
(OWS-5) activities are: 

• Development of Compliance and Integration Testing for more specifications, 
specifically SWE. 

• Refining Catalog profiles to enable sensor discovery through the use of semantics 
descriptions 

• Development of a consistent, OWS-wide security model for user identity, 
harmonized w/ GeoDRM 

• Better understand the non-functional quality attributes (e.g. reliability, 
performance, scalability) of OWS 

• Demonstrate integration of multiple OWS specifications with existing systems
