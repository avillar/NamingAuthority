What is OGC Web Services 9 (OWS-9)? 

OWS-9 builds on the outcomes of prior OGC interoperability initiatives and is organized 
around the following threads: 

-   Aviation: Develop and demonstrate the use of the Aeronautical Information Exchange 
Model (AIXM) and the Weather Exchange Model (WXXM) in an OGC Web Services 
environment, focusing on support for several Single European Sky ATM Research 
(SESAR) project requirements as well as FAA (US Federal Aviation Administration) 
Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) and Aircraft Access to SWIM (System 
Wide Information Management) (AAtS) requirements. 

-   Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI): Build on the CCI work accomplished in 
OWS–8 by increasing interoperability within communities sharing geospatial data, 
focusing on semantic mediation, query results delivery, data provenance and quality and 
Single Point of Entry Global Gazetteer. 

-   Security and Services Interoperability (SSI): Investigate 5 main activities: Security 
Management, OGC Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard 
Application Schema UGAS (UML to GML Application Schema) Updates, Web Services 
Façade, Reference Architecture Profiling, and Bulk Data Transfer. 

-   OWS Innovations: Explore topics that represent either new areas of work for the 
Consortium (such as GPS and Mobile Applications), a desire for new approaches to 



OGC 12-146

existing technologies to solve new challenges (such as the OGC Web Coverage Service 
(WCS) work), or some combination of the two. 

-   Compliance & Interoperability Testing & Evaluation (CITE): Develop a suite of 
compliance test scripts for testing and validation of products with interfaces 
implementing the following OGC standards: Web Map Service (WMS) 1.3 Interface 
Standard, Web Feature Service (WFS) 2.0 Interface Standard, Geography Markup 
Language (GML) 3.2.1 Encoding Standard, OWS Context 1.0 (candidate encoding 
standard), Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards, Web Coverage Service for Earth 
Observation (WCS-EO) 1.0 Interface Standard, and TEAM (Test, Evaluation, And 
Measurement) Engine Capabilities. 
The OWS-9 sponsors are: AGC (Army Geospatial Center, US Army Corps of 
Engineers), CREAF-GeoViQua-EC, EUROCONTROL, FAA (US Federal Aviation 
Administration), GeoConnections - Natural Resources Canada, Lockheed Martin 
Corporation, NASA (US National Aeronautics and Space Administration), NGA (US

4 Executive Summary 

The Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) is designed to enable the 
management and distribution of Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) data in digital 
format. The newest version of this model, AIXM 5.1, is based on GML 3.2 and features 
an exhaustive temporality model loosely based on the GML Dynamic Feature Model. 

Various interoperability test-beds at OGC, in particular OWS-7 and OWS-8, have applied 
OGC’s WFS 2.0 and FES 2.0 standards on AIXM 5 data. Though it could be 
demonstrated that a basic interoperability is possible, it turned out that some key 
requirements could not be fulfilled.  

After OWS-8, work on an extension to the WFS specification started to overcome these 
shortcomings. This work was continued and intensified in OWS-9, resulting in the WFS 
Temporality Extension Discussion Paper, OGC document 12-027r2. It summarized the 
observations made and showed that these requirements are not specific to AIXM 5, but 
more generally apply to any data model featuring temporality.  

5 Accomplishments 

By creating the WFS TE Discussion Paper, the following accomplishments were made. 

5.1 Identification of use cases for aviation 

A total of 8 use cases where identified out of different areas of application, including but 
not limited to visualization, decision support, AIP publication, NOTAM communication 
and data replication.

5.2 Mapping of use cases to WFS operations and FES filters 

Where possible, the identified use cases where mapped to WFS operations and FES 
filters.  

5.3 Problem analysis, categorization and generalization 

A problem analysis revealed two key unfulfilled requirements: 

1. The ability to filter time slices using FES filters 

2. The ability to generate SNAPSHOT time slices 

5.4 Identification of AIXM TM specifics compared to the general GML Dynamic 
Feature Model 

AIXM 5.1 temporality model is loosely based on the GML Dynamic Feature Model. A 
detailed comparison of both models was undertaken. 

5.5 Conceptual design of the extension 

An extension of WFS/FES was designed. This process included discussion with 
interested parties from other perspectives (e.g. clients) and performance considerations 
like required bandwidth and minimum latency.  

5.6 Model creation and generation of a physical representation 

A model of the extension was created and embedded in the existing UML model of 
WFS/FES. A physical model (XML Schema) was then generated out of the UML model 
using existing transformation tools. 

5.7 Documentation 

A detailed documentation of all introduced elements and the overall concept was created. 

5.8 Proof that all use cases are covered and example creation 

For each of the identified use cases mentioned above it was tested whether it is covered 
by the created extension. For each, an example query was created. 

5.9 Implementation 

Parts of the extension were implemented on server side in the Web Feature Service  of 
CADAS-AIMDB, COMSOFT’s AIXM 5.1 database. These were in particular: 

 SNAPSHOT generation   



OGC 12-146

 PropertyExclusion projection clause 

6 Demo scenarios and tested Temporality Extension use cases 

Two scenarios where created and demonstrated: 

 Retrieve the state of a runway at a specific point in time (SNAPSHOT generation) 

 Retrieve all airports fulfilling specific constraints at a point in time in the future 
(BASELINE filtering) 

As there were no client implementations available, COMSOFT created a thin client for 
the purposes of the demo.  

7 Implementation results 

No specific observations were made during the implementation of the Temporality 
Extension. The implemented parts are ready to be used in future test beds. 

8 Future work items 

Future work items directly related to the work on the specification can be found in the 
discussion paper. Items relevant for future test beds are listed below. 

8.1 Implementation and tests 

A more complete implementation should be provided to allow further testing. It should 
especially include a client and advanced functionality such as the evaluation of properties 
with schedules. 

8.2 Handling of long-term data 

Future test beds should include long-term aspects of handling of AIXM 5.1 data, 
including long histories of permanent and temporary changes. This would more reflect 
real-world scenarios and would emphasis the importance of the Temporality Extension. 

8.3 Compatibility 

In the course of maturation of the extension, further effort should be invested in the 
compatibility of the extension with the existing WFS standard, e.g. regarding join 
queries.  

Regarding the compatibility with AIXM, future test beds should include transactional 
operations in their focus covering the complete life time of features (commissioning, 
permanent changes, temporary changes, corrections, cancelations, decommissioning).

8.4 Property exclusion 

The test bed revealed that the introduced projection clause for excluding properties is also 
useful for other domains and areas of application, like event services [see OWS-9 
Archtiecture Engineering Report]. As it isn’t directly related to the temporality issues, the 
PropertyExclusion projection clause should be separated from the Temporality Extension 
and given its own namespace.   

9 Benefits for the Aviation Architecture 

Existing test beds for the Aviation domain focused on the general processing of AIXM 
data so far. The history of features played only a minor role. Sample data mainly 
consisted of one time slice per feature (the commissioning) and temporary changes 
(DNOTAMs). Permanent changes were barely used, as were corrections and cancelations 
of data. In these simple scenarios, exchanging features with the full history of time slices 
was not a problem. 

A key design element of the AIXM TM is that it never forgets. For long-running 
productive systems, the amount of time slices of a feature can grow to great numbers. 
Efficient retrieval of a set of time slices of interest will then become a key requirement. 
The WFS Temporality Extension paves the way for these use cases in an efficient and 
convenient manner. 

Another key functionality developed is the generation of SNAPSHOT time slices, which 
represent the complete state of a feature at a given point in time. This relieves clients 
from implementing the complex AIXM TM algorithm and also saves bandwidth. It 
enables “thin” clients, which do not need to have a full understanding of the AIXM 
Temporality Model to successfully interact with an AIXM 5.1 data store through the 
WFS. Support for recurring changes of data on a regular basis, called “properties with 
schedules” in AIXM TM terminology, is also included, as are constraints based on the 
value of a property in the future, which are important for decision support applications.
