Preface 

This document is a deliverable of the OGC Web Services (OWS) Initiative - Phase 8 
(OWS-8). It describes the results of the conceptual and schematron rule based validation 
of the Digital NOTAM Event Specification. 

This document is a deliverable of the OGC Web Services (OWS) Initiative - Phase 8 
(OWS-8). It describes the results of the conceptual and schematron rule based validation 
of the Digital NOTAM Event Specification (DNES). Various conceptual aspects were 
identified which need clarification and/or revision. Schematron rules were developed for 
a number of the DNES scenarios. This document contains coverage tables which 
document normative statements from the DNES and indicate which of them can be tested 
with existing schematron rules. 

This document is a deliverable for the OGC Web Services 8 (OWS-8) testbed activity. 
OWS testbeds are part of OGC's Interoperability Program, a global, hands-on and 
collaborative prototyping program designed to rapidly develop, test and deliver proven 
candidate standards or revisions to existing standards into OGC's Standards Program, 
where they are formalized for public release. In OGC's Interoperability Initiatives, 
international teams of technology providers work together to solve specific geoprocessing 
interoperability problems posed by the Initiative's sponsoring organizations. OGC 
Interoperability Initiatives include test beds, pilot projects, interoperability experiments 
and interoperability support services - all designed to encourage rapid development, 
testing, validation and adoption of OGC standards. 

The OWS-8 sponsors are organizations seeking open standards for their interoperability 
requirements. After analyzing their requirements, the OGC Interoperability Team 
recommend to the sponsors that the content of the OWS-8 initiative be organized around 
the following threads: 

    * Observation Fusion 
    * Geosynchronization (Gsync) 

    * Cross-Community Interoperability (CCI) 
    * Aviation

1.4 Future work 

Improvements in this document are desirable to the following topics. 

● Validation of Text NOTAM Production Rules - Validation of the information 
contained in textual NOTAMs via schematron rules is complex. Given the scope of 
the overall validation task at hand as well as the resources for OWS-8, the Text 
NOTAM production rules were not included in the validation efforts (except for some 
production rules from general sections). This task was deferred to future activities. 

● Validation of Digital NOTAM - This document has identified a majority of the 
normative statements discovered from the DNES document, though not all scenarios 
are covered in completion. During development of the schematron rules, these 
normative statements were used as a guide - considering each statement and whether 
it’s appropriate for a schematron rule to enforce. Not all normative statements have 
been considered and these have been marked with TBD. 

● Invocation of validation tools - When considering the most appropriate way to 
invocate the validation tools for AIXM and Digital NOTAM in the context of OGC 
SDI recommendations resulted with the idea of wrapping the validation tool into a 
WPS process. This idea expanded to a WPS Application Profile that describes a set of 
processes for validating conformance of GML documents against a GML Application 
Schema. Considerations include: 

○ A multiple process approach where the process name identifies the validation 
profile to use; e.g. validateAIXM, validateDNOTAM, valdiateCityGML. The 
WPS mechanisms then provide appropriate capabilities advertisement via the 
list of processes and using describeProcess. 

○ Alternatively a single process approach that includes a parameter to identify 
the application schema (or validation profile) to apply during validation. More 
easily expandable and more likely supported in the existing approach to 
defining WPS Application Profiles where each process must be defined, but 
may also require a getSupportedValidationProfiles process, which seems to 
introduce unnecessary duplication of interface abstraction. 

○ Potential process parameters: 
■ URL of content to validate, examples include a GML document or WFS 

response. 
■ An identifier to nominate the application schema to use for validation, as 

already discussed. Perhaps call this the Validation Profile. The WPS process 
will need to support the application schema, and decide what validation 
technology or technologies it will apply; XML Schema, Schematron, 
RelaxNG, custom validation to handle otherwise non-testable constraints. 

■ Output format for validation results, if more than one is to be supported.  



OGC 11-092r2

○ Define the response format of the validation result. 
○ Include a schema only validation process. The server would not need prior 

knowledge of the schema as long as the schemas to apply can be derived from 
the XML file. 

○ Include a schematron only validation process where the schematron file is 
provided by the caller. Could also provide RelaxNG, XML Schema and 
possibly other validation methods this way.  

● Enrichment of DNOTAM data – In some cases the normative statements of the 
Digital NOTAM Event Specification presume the availability of information 
which is not part of a DNOTAM (e.g. checking against designators in BASELINE 
data). To process such rules a validation tool must provide a method for retrieving 
such information from an AIXM data store. This is closely related to the Event 
enrichment in the Event Architecture of OWS (see OGC 11-093, section 9.5.1). 
Some of the observed issues presumably also apply for enrichment regarding 
automatic validation. Hence, a general approach for dealing with dynamic 
features in web service architectures should be discussed. 

 

1.5 Foreword 

This document is a deliverable of the OGC Web Services (OWS) Initiative - Phase 8 
(OWS-8). It describes the results of the conceptual and schematron rule based validation 
of the Digital NOTAM Event Specification (DNES). Various conceptual aspects were 
identified which need clarification and/or revision. Schematron rules were developed for 
a number of the DNES scenarios. This document contains coverage tables which 
document normative statements from the DNES and indicate which of them can be tested 
with existing schematron rules.

4 OWS-8 Report on Digital NOTAM Event overview 

The specified OWS-8 Report on Digital NOTAM Event documents the results of the 
work performed in the OWS-8 Aviation thread on validating the Digital NOTAM Event 
Specification (DNES). 

The DNES defines how information that is currently published through NOTAM 
messages shall be encoded in a harmonized way based upon AIXM 5.1.  

Currently, a NOTAM is a simple but structured text note which is intended to be read by 
pilots, controllers and other operational personnel involved in flight operations. For 
example, a NOTAM can provide information about the activation of a certain airspace - 
which may require re-planning of a flight that was intended to pass through that airspace. 
In order to improve the exchange and use of the information conveyed via NOTAMs, the 
DNES defines the format of Digital NOTAMs (DNOTAM). These are intended for 
consumption by automated systems. In addition, the specification covers rules for 
handling specific event scenarios. 

The DNES supports the provision of the currently used text NOTAM together with a 
DNOTAM. This facilitates the transition from text NOTAM to pure DNOTAM - a 
process that is expected to require years. 

The current version of the DNES defines encoding rules that cover both general events 
but also events that are specific to certain scenarios. These scenarios were selected by the 
Digital NOTAM Event Specification Focus Group for the Increment 1 of the digital 
NOTAM implementation in Europe. These scenarios may be adapted and extended in the 
future. The current version of the DNES therefore shall be considered as guidance 
material, not as a normative specification. Nevertheless, the rules defined in the DNES 
are intended to ultimately achieve interoperability of systems that publish and receive 
DNOTAMs.  

To achieve interoperability, the DNES is validated through implementations and general 
reviews by the community. One example is the work performed with respect to the 
European AIS Database (EAD). Another example is OWS-8. 

Within the OWS-8 Aviation thread, the DNES was validated through: 

● review of the conceptual aspects of DNOTAM design and usage rules 
● creation of a schematron rule set for automatically testing DNOTAMs against the 

rules defined by the DNES. 
The results of these validation efforts are documented in this report.

5 Validation Results - Conceptual Aspects 

The following sections provide detailed information on the issues that were identified 
during the validation of the DNES.  

5.1 Encoding of Geometries 

5.1.1 Problem Statement and Description 

Section 5.3 in the DNES defines how geometrical and geographical data is encoded in a 
DNOTAM - more specifically, how it is encoded in a text NOTAM. The encoding rules 
stated in section 5.3.2 describe the general patterns for encoding points, lines and 
polygons - with its various facets - while section 5.3.4 describes the actual text NOTAM 
production rules. 

These patterns show that it is possible to encode a “Datum” other than WGS-84 (which is 
the default). The encoding of “Lat”/“Long” fields shall use the first/second value of a 
“.../gml:pos” element. The encoding of the “Datum” depends on the srsName attribute for 
the “aixm:Point, aixm:ElevatedPoint, aixm:Curve, aixm:ElevatedCurve, aixm:Surface or 
aixm:ElevatedSurface concerned”. 

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) not only incorporates the datum but also defines 
the coordinate system that is being used, including the axis order. The “Use of GML in 
aeronautical data” document describes this in more detail. It recommends to use 
EPSG:4326 as the default CRS. EPSG:4326 uses WGS-84.  

In GML, the CRS of a geometry is given via the value of its (explicitly given or derived) 
“srsName”. Again, the “Use of GML in aeronautical data” provides further details. 

The general encoding instructions in DNES section 5.3.2 and 5.3.4 should be revised 
because: 

● They treat “Datum” equal to “CRS” although these are different - albeit related - 
concepts: “Datum” is used in the pattern diagrams and gets the value of the 
“srsName” attribute of a geometry. 

● They assume that latitude/longitude is always given as the first/second value of a 
gml:pos although this depends on the CRS of the relevant geometry, and no 
further restriction is made regarding the values of the “srsName” of  geometries 
that would require a (supposedly: ellipsoidal) coordinate system with “latitude” as 
first axis and “longitude” as second axis. Note that this would still allow for both 
two and three-dimensional CRS. 

● They assume that the srsName attribute is encoded for the aixm:Point, 
aixm:Curve, or aixm:Surface concerned (and their elevated equivalents). The text 
is silent (at least in section 5.3.2; in section 5.3.4 the OGC document 11-060 is at 
least mentioned) about the fact that - as explained in the “Use of GML for 



OGC 11-092r2 

10 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

aeronautical data” document - a geometry without srsName derives its CRS from 
its closest ancestor that has an srsName. However, it is possible that no such 
ancestor exists, i.e. no ancestor has an srsName. This is possible because the 
srsName for all geometries of a feature can also be defined via the srsName of the 
gml:Envelope in the boundedBy element of that feature or the feature collection 
in which the feature is contained. 

5.1.2 Available Options / Solutions 

If the “Datum” field is actually intended to identify the complete CRS and not only the 
datum, then it should be renamed accordingly. Otherwise, clarification is needed in the 
encoding description for that field, in that the srsName of the geometry concerned is only 
used to identify the actual datum (like WGS-84) - and that the coordinate system 
(supposedly “ellipsoidal with latitude as first axis and longitude as second axis”) is fixed. 

As the “Datum” field is optional according to the templates, the default value should be 
mentioned. As stated in section 3 of the “Use for GML in aeronautical data” document, 
ICAO Annex 15 requires that all “published aeronautical geographical coordinates 
(indicating latitude and longitude) shall be expressed in terms of the WGS-84 geodetic 
reference datum”. So the DNES should note that this is the default.  

If the “Datum” field actually is intended to identify the complete CRS (see previous 
paragraph) then the default value should be EPSG:4326, which is generally 
recommended as explained in the “Use for GML in aeronautical data” document. 

If the encoding instructions for the “Lat” and “Long” fields are not revised, then 
clarification should be added to the “Datum” field that the value of the srsName is not 
allowed to identify a CRS that does not have an ellipsoidal coordinate system with 
“latitude” as first axis and “longitude” as second axis. Otherwise, the rules should be re-
written to take the value of the relevant CRS into account. For example, the rule for 
encoding the “Lat” field could be “n-th value of the gml:pos element, n being the ordinal 
of the “latitude” axis in the CRS that the geometry is provided in”. 

The text - both in section 5.3.2 and 5.3.4 - that explains how the srsName value is 
provided for a geometry should be revised to just point to the “Use for GML in 
aeronautical data” document, which provides the required information in sufficient detail. 

5.1.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

The “Datum” field should be renamed to “CRS” or equivalent. Text passages that 
mention “geographical datum” should be changed accordingly. 

EPSG:4326 should be noted as the default value for that field, following the “Use for 
GML in aeronautical data” guidelines. 

With respect to the conventions of axis order required by ArcByCenterPoint and the 
requirements from the aeronautical domain to have 0° “north” and angle values

increasing clockwise, it appears necessary to require that the srsName attribute only 
identifies CRSs with latitude as first axis and longitude as second axis. 

5.2 Angle values 

5.2.1 Problem Statement and Description 

The encoding instructions for the start and end angle as written in the table of DNES 
section 5.3.2 require that a start angle has a value in the range of [0° ... 360°) and an end 
in the range of (0° ... 720°), the value of the end angle always being greater than that of 
the start angle. 

This is different to the requirements concerning angle values as written in the “Use of 
GML in aeronautical data” document section 2.4.2 “Arc direction”, which requires a 
value range of [-360° … 360°] for both start and end angle of a gml:ArcByCenterPoint 
and which allows the start angle to be bigger than the end angle to enable the provision of 
arc direction. No clarification is provided how these different definitions relate to each 
other. 

The DNES states that the start angle is “encoded as child gml:startAngle element of a 
gml:ArcByCentrePoint, eventually adjusted with the local magnetic declination or the 
station declination if the angle reference is not the True North.” 

This suggests that the textual encoding of  a start angle can just use the value of 
gml:ArcByCenterPoint/gml:startAngle, which is not the case.  

Section 5.3.4 defines how a gml:ArcByCenterPoint is decoded into a textual 
representation. Rather than providing the angle values, absolute positions are computed 
(or re-used) for the start and end of the arc. This approach is good. However, it does not 
match up with the approach written in section 5.3.2. The discrepancy should be solved. 

5.2.2 Available Options / Solutions 

If there is a specific requirement to use the value ranges for start and end angles in textual 
encodings as specified by the DNES section 5.3.2, then a clear formula how to convert 
from the angle values provided in a gml:ArcByCenterPoint should be provided. 
According to the actual text NOTAM production rules given in section 5.3.4, this does 
not seem to be the case. Therefore, the text in the according description fields of the table 
in DNES section 5.3.2 for start and end angle should be revised to be in line with the 
“Use of GML for aeronautical data” document. 

5.2.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

Aligning the text in the according description fields of the table in DNES section 5.3.2 
for start and end angle with the “Use of GML for aeronautical data” document is 
recommended. In fact, the requirements regarding angle value ranges should be exactly 
like in that document.

5.3 Specification and Usage of Conformance Targets 

5.3.1 Problem Statement and Description 

The DNES contains many normative statements. Many of them apply to an encoded 
dnotam:Event. However, some apply also to the data originator or publisher. Some of 
these statements can be tested with automated tools. 

It is not always clear for which entity a given statement is relevant. This makes it more 
difficult for a data originator or developer of a DNOTAM validator tool to identify the 
statements that are relevant for him/her. 

5.3.2 Available Options / Solutions 

Some specifications in the IT domain clearly identify so called conformance targets to 
which normative statements in the specifications are unambiguously assigned. For 
example, the WS-I Basic Profile 2.01 defines conformance targets such as “Message”, 
“Receiver” and “Sender”. 

The following extract from WS-I Basic Profile 2.0 section 2.1 explains the use of 
conformance targets in combination with requirements: 

 “Requirement levels, using RFC2119 language (e.g., MUST, MAY, SHOULD) indicate the nature of 
the requirement and its impact on conformance. Each requirement is individually identified (e.g., 
R9999) for convenience. 

For example: 

R1012 An ENVELOPE MUST be serialized using either UTF-8 or UTF-16 character encoding. CORE 
TESTABLE BP1018 

This requirement is identified by "R1012", applies to the target ENVELOPE, and places a requirement 
upon envelopes. 

Each requirement statement contains exactly one requirement level keyword (e.g., "MUST") and one 
conformance target keyword (e.g., "MESSAGE"). The conformance target keyword appears in bold text 
(e.g. "MESSAGE"). Other conformance targets appearing in non-bold text are being used strictly for 
their definition and NOT as a conformance target. Additional text may be included to illuminate a 
requirement or group of requirements (e.g., rationale and examples); however, prose surrounding 
requirement statements must not be considered in determining conformance.” 

As we can see, the requirements stated in WS-I Basic Profile clearly identify to which 
conformance target they apply. Rules are in place to ensure that requirements are 
unambiguous with respect to the target they apply to.

OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 13 
 

In addition, we can see that requirements have an identifier which facilitates referring to 
specific requirements. They also have tags. The tag “CORE” in the example above is 
used to indicate that this requirement always applies for an ENVELOPE. Another value 
used by the WS-I Basic Profile is “HTTP-TRANSPORT”, indicating that a given 
requirement applies if HTTP is used for communication. Finally, the tag “TESTABLE” is 
used to indicate if automated tests exist with which the requirement can be checked (the 
other value would be “NOT_TESTABLE”) - this is comparable to the “rule coverage” in 
the tables of section 8 in this report. If a requirement is testable, then the last tag 
identifies the test(s) and also provides a link to the test. 

The OGC recently also established a policy that requires new standards to also clearly 
identify conformance targets and the requirements that apply for them. 

The DNES should adopt a similar approach, i.e. clearly list and describe the set of 
relevant conformance targets - for example “Event” and “Data Originator”, maybe also 
“Text NOTAM” - and ensure that each normative statement clearly identifies the 
conformance target that it applies to. 

5.3.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

We recommend revising the DNES as described in the previous section. While the 
normative statements / requirements do not necessarily need to be identified as shown in 
the WS-I Basic Profile, they should at least explicitly name the relevant conformance 
target. 

5.4 Request for Clarification 

5.4.1 Container Format for Events 

5.4.1.1 Problem Statement and Description 

The DNES does not require a specific container format for encoding DNOTAM Event 
data. In many examples, however, AIXMBasicMessage is used to encode the data. 
Developers and users may thus be tempted to think that AIXMBasicMessage is the 
required container format. During a telcon the sponsors explained that even though 
AIXMBasicMessage is often used in examples other container formats are perfectly fine 
for transporting the relevant data. These container formats could for example carry 
application specific data, in addition to the DNOTAM Event data. 

The lack of documentation regarding the container format for communicating a 
DNOTAM Event can cause confusion and can lead to developments that are based on 
false assumptions.  



OGC 11-092r2 

14 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

5.4.1.2 Available Options / Solutions 

The DNES should explicitly state that DNOTAM Event data can be encoded using 
container formats other than AIXMBasicMessage so that this can be taken into account 
by developers and users. 

5.4.1.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

To avoid confusion a note should be added to the DNES to clarify that the specification 
allows more than one container format. This note could be added in a section that 
describes the usage of DNOTAMs in communications between system entities. There are 
multiple aspects that could be described there, see sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3. 

5.4.2 Multiple Events per Message 

5.4.2.1 Problem Statement and Description 

The DNES does not seem to contain a requirement that a message only contains one 
dnotam:Event. The currently described scenarios suggest that only one Event is needed. 
Therefore, automatic validation rules (e.g. via schematron) may be developed based upon 
this constraint. However, if this constraint is not valid then such developments would be 
flawed. 

5.4.2.2 Available Options / Solutions 

The DNES should explicitly state if multiple dnotam:Events can be communicated in one 
message (e.g. an AIXMBasicMessage or other container used to transport the data) so 
that this can be taken into account by developers and users. 

5.4.2.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

A clarification telcon with the sponsors revealed that for the current scenarios defined in 
the DNES one Event per message would in fact suffice. However, it was also said that in 
the future the DNES may define more complex scenarios where more than one Event 
may be included per message (e.g. having one Event referring to another). In addition, 
use cases like data synchronization between two system entities may be preferable. 

Simple validation tools may benefit from a constraint that there is only one Event per 
message. Use cases that do not necessarily require validation - like the data 
synchronization use case - could then still work with multiple Events per message. 
However, the schematron rules developed during the testbed support multiple 
dnotam:Events per message. 

To summarize, there does not seem to be a need to add a “one Event per message 
constraint” to the DNES. To avoid confusion a note should be added to the DNES to 
clarify that the specification allows more than one Event to be communicated in a single 
message. This note could be added in a section that describes the usage of DNOTAMs in 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 15 
 

communications between system entities. There are multiple aspects that could be 
described there, see sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.3. 

5.4.3 Message Members Unrelated to the Event 

5.4.3.1 Problem Statement and Description 

The DNES does not explicitly exclude messages that contain dnotam:Events from having 
members that are unrelated to the Event. This may cause confusion as DNOTAM 
developers and users may expect that a message containing dnotam:Event(s) is singly 
purposed. 

5.4.3.2 Available Options / Solutions 

If there is a reason for allowing a message containing dnotam:Event(s) to include 
information that is not directly related to the Event(s) then this should be explicitly 
described in the specification. 

If there is no such reason, then an according constraint should be added in the 
specification to ensure that a message containing dnotam:Event(s) is singly purposed. 

5.4.3.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

A telcon with the sponsors revealed that indeed there are reasons for allowing a message 
to contain information that is not directly related to dnotam:Event(s) contained in that 
message.  

One such reason is that features which link to a dnotam:Event may also need to link (via 
xlink:href) to other features. It is not guaranteed that each AIXM system supports such 
linking via concrete external or abstract references as defined in the “Feature 
Identification and Reference” document. Instead, these systems may only support 
concrete local references within a message, which requires that referenced features by 
included in the message as well. 

Another reason is that in some AIXM/DNOTAM applications feature Snapshots are 
included in the message to facilitate certain tasks, such as validation. 

We thus recommend to add an explicit note to the DNES which explains that a message 
containing dnotam:Event(s) shall be expected to include information that is not directly 
related to the Event(s). Such a note could be added in a section that describes the usage of 
DNOTAMs in communications between system entities - see sections 5.4.1 and 5.4.2. 



OGC 11-092r2 

16 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

5.4.4 Availability of Static Data 

5.4.4.1 Problem Statement and Description 

Section 2.1 of the DNES states that “a pre-requisite for any Digital NOTAM application 
is the availability of the corresponding static data in the form of AIXM 5.1 BASELINE 
TimeSlices.” 

According to the AIXM Temporality Model (AIXM-TM), it is possible that the static 
data is not fully provided by Baseline timeslices but also through Permdeltas for which 
no new Baseline was established: 

“Conceptually, there exists a direct dependence between PERMDELTA and BASELINE 
Time Slices. However, this does not mean that the BASELINE Time Slice needs to be 
effectively instantiated after each PERMDELTA. In an implementation, it is possible, for 
example, to ‘accumulate’ PERMDELTA Time Slices. The instantiation of a new 
BASELINE might occur, for example, after each third PERMDELTA affecting a feature.” 
(AIXM Temporality Model, p. 10) 

The text in DNES section 2.1 is therefore imprecise and a clarification desirable. 

Furthermore, DNES section 3.2 states: 

“It shall be noted that the Event is a regular AIXM feature, therefore it has TimeSlices. 
This allows updating an Event: 

● each Event will be first encoded as a PERMDELTA/BASELINE TimeSlice pair; 
● an eventual change in the Event information (the equivalent of a NOTAM 

Replacement or Cancellation) shall be encoded as an additional Event TimeSlice 
(PERMDELTA and modified BASELINE).” 

 

The first bullet item implies that each dnotam:Event is initialized via both a Permdelta 
and a Baseline timeslice. As discussed before, the Temporality Model does not require 
that each Permdelta is accompanied by an according Baseline and vice versa. Encoding a 
new dnotam:Event with both a Permdelta and Baseline appears to be counter-intuitive 
with respect to the goal of DNOTAM and the Temporality Model (to enable efficient 
encoding and communication of feature changes), as both timeslices will contain almost 
the same information. It is not clear if each new dnotam:Event has to be published with 
both Permdelta and Baseline or if creation and transmission of just one of the timeslices 
is sufficient. 

There are several sections that are inconsistent in the way that they refer to static data: 

● section 5.6.2.2: “the Event update shall be encoded as a new PERMDELTA 
TimeSlice of the corresponding Event feature, with an incremented 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 17 
 

sequenceNumber. The PERMDELTA shall contain the updated value for the 
featureLifetime property. If the new end of validity is estimated, then the rules for 
Events with estimated end of validity shall be followed” - this only mentions 
Permdeltas 

● section 5.6.3.2: “ER-03: If the original Event has been encoded as one or more 
PERMDELTA/BASELINE TimeSlices for a new AIXM Feature, then the update 
shall be encoded as a ‘correction’ of the initial PERMDELTA TimeSlice, having 
the same sequenceNumber as the initial PERMDELTA (‘1’), an increment 
correctionNumber (‘1’), an empty gml:validTime with nilReason=’inapplicable’ 
and an empty aixm:featureLifetime with nilReason=’inapplicable’” - here, 
Permdeltas and Baselines are mentioned at first but then only Permdeltas are 
mentioned. 

5.4.4.2 Available Options / Solutions 

The following options were identified to provide sufficient clarification or to solve the 
problem for the imprecision in DNES section 2.1: 

1. Revise the Temporality Model - If the Temporality Model required that each 
PERMDELTA has a corresponding BASELINE and that consequently there 
cannot be a sequence of PERMDELTAs without intermediate BASELINEs, the 
text in the DNES could be kept as is. 

2. Instead of talking about “BASELINE” and “BASELINE TimeSlice(s)”, the last 
two paragraphs of DNES section 2.1 could instead talk about “static data”. A note 
or footnote should then be added to explain that according to the AIXM-TM static 
data is represented by both the BASELINE and the PERMDELTA timeslices of 
an AIXM feature.  

The DNES should be explicit in how dnotam:Event data must be made available by a 
data originator and how Events may be published. According to sponsors, existing 
DNOTAM applications allow the client to decide how they want to get Event data 
encoded when it is pushed to them - as just Permdelta, Baseline or both. Apparently 
existing applications do not require that both Permdelta and Baseline are provided in an 
Event. However, if clients are allowed to choose which timeslice types are encoded in 
Events that are contained in messages then at least the data originator has to ensure that 
both Permdelta and Baselines are available for a dnotam:Event. To encode both timeslice 
types in a dnotam:Event that is communicated via messages should also be the default 
behavior. 

The sections in the DNES with inconsistent way of referring to static data should be 
reviewed and rephrased according to the default behavior of having a Permdelta and 
Baseline as default for static changes to dnotam:Events. 



OGC 11-092r2 

18 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

5.4.4.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

Regarding clarification of section 2.1: the first option requires a change to the 
AIXM-TM. That change may impact existing systems and appears to be unnecessarily 
restrictive. The second option is therefore recommended. 

Regarding creation, provision and encoding of dnotam:Events: the DNES should require 
that data originators create and maintain dnotam:Events with Permdeltas and according 
Baselines (keeping them in synch following the Temporality Model). It should require 
that the default behavior for publishing Events is to encode them using both timeslice 
types. However, it should also explicitly mention that applications may define ways to let 
clients indicate which timeslice type they want to receive. 

Relevant statements in the DNES should be reviewed and revised if necessary with 
respect to inconsistent usage of static AIXM feature data timeslices: Permdeltas and 
Baselines. 

5.4.5 Scenario Identifier for Event Update 

5.4.5.1 Problem Statement and Description 

Section 5.6 defines the rules for encoding an update to a previously published 
dnotam:Event. Such updates are currently defined for the cases of updating an Event’s 
end time and for cancelling it. In both cases, the update is encoded as another 
dnotam:Event with a Permdelta timeslice instead of a Baseline. 

It is essential that each dnotam:Event gets a unique gml:identifier. If a dnotam:Event did 
not have such an identifier then it cannot be updated as defined by the DNES. That the 
originator/publisher of a dnotam:Event has to assign a unique gml:identifier to the Event 
is implicit as an Event is an AIXM feature and AIXM features require that they get a 
unique gml:identifier value - see the “Feature Identification and Reference” document for 
further details. As this requirement on Event originators/publishers is not explicitly 
recorded in the DNES, there is a chance that developers and users of the DNES may not 
comply with it. 

5.4.5.2 Available Options / Solutions 

As the requirement to assign a gml:identifier is implicit the DNES does not necessarily 
need to be changed. 

On the other hand, clarification on gml:identifier assignment may avoid confusion in the 
future. The last paragraph in DNES section 3.2 elaborates that an “Event is a regular 
AIXM feature” and that it can be updated because it has timeslices following the 
Temporality Model. A simple addition of “(which includes the assignment of a unique 
gml:identifier to the Event)” to the statement “each Event will be first encoded as a 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 19 
 

PERMDELTA/BASELINE TimeSlice pair” would suffice to clarify that each 
dnotam:Event has to have a unique gml:identifier. 

5.4.5.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

Even though repetition of requirements that are inherited from other specifications 
usually is a bad idea, we recommend to make an exception here and to revise the text in 
DNES section 3.2 as described in the previous section. 

5.4.6 Embedding the Standard Version into the Scenario Identifier 

5.4.6.1 Problem Statement and Description 

Section 3.4 specifies how the scenario that a dnotam:Event was instantiated for is 
identified. The “scenario” property of a dnotam:Event contains the respective identifier. 
The DNES version number is embedded into this identifier. 

It is good to know the version of the scenario that a given Event was encoded with 
because the rules (data encoding, automatic validation and text NOTAM production) may 
change between different versions of the DNES. Code - for example schematron 
validation rules - that was written for a specific scenario and version may thus be more 
easily re-used if the scenario rules have not changed. 

That the “scenario” property also includes the DNES version is problematic, though, 
because it overloads the meaning of that property. 

5.4.6.2 Available Options / Solutions 

It may be that there are other benefits to this approach that have not been identified here. 
If this is the case then the DNES should identify them. 

Otherwise, scenario identifier and DNES version should be separated and stored in 
distinct Event properties. Not mixing independent concepts in the same property value is 
good modeling practice. 

5.4.6.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

We recommend to separate event scenario and DNES version and to model them as 
distinct dnotam:Event properties. 

5.4.7 Improve Path Notation in Data Field Mappings 

5.4.7.1 Problem Statement and Description 

The DNES presents the data that is usually provided by the data originators for each 
event category in the form of “templates”, using EBNF (Extended Backus Naur Form) 
and provided in graphical representation. Tables then provide a mapping from the data 



OGC 11-092r2 

20 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

items contained in the templates to the relevant field(s) in the AIXM model. The mapping 
is made through path expressions like the following: 

● Navaid.type 
● (NavaidEquipment and Navaid)/NavaidOperationalStatus.operationalStatus 
● RunwayDirection/ManoeuvringAreaAvailability.operationalStatus 
● AirportHeliport/..Availability/..Usage.operation 
● AirportHeliport/..Availability/..Usage/ConditionCombination.logicalOperator 
● AirportHeliport/..Availability/..Usage/../FlightCharacteristics 
● Airport/AirportTimeSlice/TimePeriod.beginPosition 
● Event/EventTimeSlice.validTime/timePosition 
● Event/EventTimeSlice.featureLifetime/beginPosition 
● aixm:Surface/gml:patches/gml:PolygonPatch/gml:exterior/gml:Ring/gml:curveM

ember/gml:Curve/gml:segments Apparently, the path notation used throughout 
the document is inconsistent: 

● Sometimes timeslices are explicitly mentioned.  
● Sometimes the path is abbreviated using “..”.  
● Sometimes a more UML / OCL like expression is used (with dot notation - for 

example Navaid.type). 
● Sometimes an XPath like expression is used. 
● etc. 

A consistent path notation is desirable to avoid confusion and misunderstandings. 

5.4.7.2 Available Options / Solutions 

Two options to improve the path notation in the AIXM mappings were identified. 

Option 1 

The first option involves stating the class name of the relevant AIXM feature type first, 
followed by a dot-separated list of property names to point to the exact property that is of 
interest. For the examples from the previous section, this would look as follows:

The following rules were used: 

● The path starts with the name of a class, usually a <<feature>> type although an 
<<object>> type can also be used as long as the path is unambiguous within the 
given DNES scenario. 

● Once the start is known, the path continues with a dot separated list of property 
names. Each property is of a certain type. If that type is simple, the path naturally 
ends. If the type is complex, the path may end. Otherwise the path continues, then 
continuing with the name of a property of the complex type we reached before. 
When the path ends then the value of the property represented by the last segment 
in the path is the mapping of the data item in the template. 



OGC 11-092r2 

22 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

● Choices in path elements - usually to allow two path expressions to be combined 
into one if only the start elements are different (see Navaid|NavaidEquipment 
example) - can be represented by separating the choice items with “|” and by 
putting the resulting string in parentheses. 

● Path elements may target abstract types. For example, the type of “Surface.patch” 
in the example is abstract: GM_ SurfacePatch. There are multiple non-abstract 
subtypes of GM_SurfacePatch. In the example, GM_Polygon was chosen. To 
indicate that the value of a property is of a specific type, the type can be added in 
parentheses right after the property name. The path can then continue as usual - 
with the assumption that all properties of the subtype are accessible. If a property 
of the abstract type itself shall be followed - and thus implicitly allowing the value 
of the property to be of any non-abstract subtype - then the property would simply 
be stated by name, without any parentheses that further qualify it. 

● If timeslice specific properties are of interest then the “timeSlice” is explicitly 
mentioned in the path expression, right after the name of the AIXM feature type 
at the start of the path. If the “timeslice” step is omitted then the path targets the 
given timeslice (e.g. Permdelta in a dnotam:Event or Tempdelta in the AIXM 
feature that points to a dnotam:Event and is given in a DNOTAM) or the timeslice 
that contains the applicable value of the targeted property (for example if a path 
involved resolving another AIXM feature and determining the value of one of its 
properties for a given time).  
Note that the featureLifetime is not a timeslice specific property but in fact a 
property of the feature itself. The timeslice specific properties are: validTime, 
sequenceNumber, correctionNumber, timeSliceMetadata and interpretation.  

● If the begin or end of a time period - for example the valid time of a timeslice - 
shall be mapped, then the path would include a property named “begin” or “end”, 
respectively. This follows the ISO 19108 UML model of TM_Period which only 
has a “begin” property for a TM_Period, not a “beginPosition”. In GML, 
TM_Period is encoded by gml:TimePeriod. A gml:TimePeriod can encode its 
start time either via the “begin” property (including or referencing a 
gml:TimeInstant) or via the “beginPosition” property (which contains the start 
time position directly). The DNES should state that “validTime.begin” maps to 
“gml:validTime/gml:TimePeriod/gml:beginPosition” or 
“gml:validTime/gml:TimePeriod/gml:begin” - one of which has to be available in 
a gml:TimePeriod; same for the “featureLifetime” and end times.  

 

The last example shown in the table is about a Surface, an <<object>> type defined by 
AIXM. This example is tricky because: 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 23 
 

●  Surface is derived from GM_Surface and thus the path needs to be looked up in 
ISO 19107. In general it is more simple to follow paths if they follow properties 
within the same model (like the AIXM or DNOTAM model). Paths with few 
steps are of course also simpler to follow than paths with many steps. 

● The UML model from ISO 19107 and the XML encoding defined by GML do not 
always completely match up. Here we see that the UML model requires an 
additional step via the “boundary” property of a GM_Polygon to get to its 
“exterior” boundary. In GML the “exterior” boundary is a direct property of a 
PolygonPatch (the GML type that implements GM_Polygon). The naming may 
also differ: in the ISO UML model a GM_Ring has a property called “generator”; 
in GML the corresponding property is named “curveMember”. 

 

Option 2 

Another option would be to use XPath like expressions. For the examples from the 
previous section, this would look as follows:

The following rules were used: 

● As in option 1, the path starts with the qualified name of an element representing 
a <<feature>> type although an <<object>> type can also be used as long as the 
path is unambiguous within the given DNES scenario. 

● Once the start is known, the path continues, following XPath notation (i.e. 
walking through the XML structure). The last element in the path expression is 
the mapping of the data item in the template. If that element is of simple type, 
then it is the value of the element. Otherwise it is the element itself (thus 
sometimes an additional “/*” at the end of the path is required). 

● Choices in path elements - usually to allow two path expressions to be combined 
into one if only the start elements are different (see Navaid|NavaidEquipment 
example) - can be represented by separating the choice items with “|” and by 
putting the resulting string in parentheses. 

● Path elements may target abstract types. To indicate that the value of a property is 
of a specific type, the XPath expression would just state it. To allow any 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 25 
 

substitute of a given type to be included in the data, in other words to just work 
with the supertype (whether it is abstract or not is irrelevant here) one can include 
a schema-element() function - this is shown in the last example for the gml:Ring 
element. 

● If timeslice specific properties are of interest then the “aixm:timeSlice” is 
explicitly stated in the path expression. If the “timeslice” step is omitted then the 
path targets the given timeslice (e.g. Permdelta in a dnotam:Event or Tempdelta in 
the AIXM feature that points to a dnotam:Event and is given in a DNOTAM) or 
the timeslice that contains the applicable value of the targeted property (for 
example if a path involved resolving another AIXM feature and determining the 
value of one of its properties for a given time). 
Again, note that the featureLifetime is not a timeslice specific property but in fact 
a property of the feature itself. 
An alternative would be to always include “aixm:timeSlice/*” in the path 
expressions. 

 
5.4.7.3 Conclusion and Recommendation 

Two options for a consistent path notation in the DNES were presented. The first option 
is easier to follow when looking at the UML model, while option 2 is easier to follow in 
the XML encoding. Option 2 appears to be more verbose than option 1. 

To conclude, we can only recommend to review the path notation used in the DNES and 
to make it more consistent throughout the specification. The options suggested in the 
previous section may be useful for a revision of the path notation. Some rules may be too 
complex to realize and may thus be amended or omitted. 

5.4.8 Additional Clarifications 

Some of the requested clarifications do not justify the creation of new subsections, as the 
clarification is just a minor one in comparison. These minor clarifications are thus 
summarized in the following list: 

● Corridor encoding - Section 5.3.2 of the DNES describes the encoding of a 
“Corridor”. The according table entry should point to the “Use of GML in 
aeronautical data” document, which contains detailed information how to encode 
corridors in GML. 

● SAA.ACT non-duplication with other Events - Section 4.2.5 of the DNES 
states that “there should not exist another Airspace TEMPDELTA with an 
overlapping (partially or totally) gml:validTime and which also contains 
aixm:activation elements.” It is not clear what “there” means - it could be the 
same message (AIXMBasicMessage or other container) or even an authoritative 
data store. The statement also is not explicit if the other “Airspace 



OGC 11-092r2 

26 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

TEMPDELTA” belongs to the same Airspace or to another Airspace (though the 
former definitely makes more sense).  
The statement should be reconsidered and possibly removed, given that 
Tempdeltas with activation elements of the same Airspace may have the same 
validTime but different sequence or correction number. Furthermore, in some 
applications it might make sense to have Tempdeltas with overlapping validTime 
- e.g. when the application allows Airspace activations to be managed (reserved 
and approved or disapproved) and the according information is encoded via 
extension in Airspace activation elements. 

● SAA.NEW Airspace activity code for Parachute – Section 4.4.5 of the DNES 
states: “If aixm:type=PJE, then the geometry of the area should not intersect the 
geometry of an existing Airspace with type ‘CTR’ or ‘TMA’.” The path should be 
Airspace.activation.activity and not aixm:type. Furthermore, the value should be 
PARACHUTE and not PJE. 

● Event end time update handling of static data - The rules ER-01 and ER-02 in 
section 5.6.2.2 of the DNES should be aggregated into one rule, because updating 
an Event’s end time by issuing new Permdeltas and according Baselines usually is 
a combined activity. See section 5.4.4 for further details. 

● Identification of schedule annotation for Event NOTAM - In section 5.2.6 of 
the DNES, a statement says that “[...] any eventual TS.note (schedule annotations) 
shall be converted into free text [...]”. It is not clear which element of a digital 
NOTAM is identified by “TS.note” (PropertyWithSchedule.annotation, 
PropertyWithSchedule.timeInterval.annotation or something else). This should be 
clarified. 

● Cancellation of Inactive Event  
○ Change of FeatureLifetime - ER-02 in DNES section 5.6.3.2 states “If 

the original Event has been encoded as one or more TEMPDELTA 
TimeSlices for existing AIXM Features, then the update shall be encoded 
as a ‘correction’ TimeSlice for each affected feature. A new TEMPDELTA 
shall be created having the same sequenceNumber as the initial 
PERMDELTA, an increment correctionNumber (‘1’), an empty 
gml:validTime with nilReason=’inapplicable’ and an empty 
aixm:featureLifetime with nilReason=’inapplicable’.” 
 
First of all, there is a minor editorial issue: “PERMDELTA” should be 
replaced with “TEMPDELTA”.  
What is more important is that the Tempdelta timeslices for existing 
AIXM features are cancelled by providing a correction timeslice with both 
the validTime and the featureLifetime being empty and nilReason set to 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 27 
 

“inapplicable”. Even though the Temporality Model section 3.7 has a 
diagram which reflects this behavior, the text there states the following: 
“To clearly indicate that the change contained in the TimeSlice has been 
canceled, the gml:validTime property will be empty and it will have the 
nilReason attribute set to ‘inapplicable’”. Also including an empty 
featureLifetime in the corrected timeslice appears to be unnecessary 
overhead and may even cause confusion in that an AIXM feature may be 
regarded as having been cancelled completely (in case that the corrected 
timeslice is of type Permdelta or Baseline). The diagram in the 
Temporality Model and the statement in the DNES should be revised by 
omitting the change of the featureLifetime - both in ER-02 of DNES 
section 5.6.3.2 and the “Feature TEMPDELTA correction” ADVR in 
section 5.6.3.3. Note that both of these sections deal with the cancellation 
of Tempdeltas.  
Nilling the featureLifetime on Permdelta and Baseline timeslices that 
represent the commissioning of a new Event or AIXM feature (see ER-01 
and ER-03 in DNES section 5.6.3.2 as well as the ADVRs “Event 
PERMDELTA correction” and “Feature PERMDELTA correction” in 
DNES section 5.6.3.3) may be appropriate to emphasize that the 
commissioning is cancelled. However, the ADVRs “Event PERMDELTA 
correction” and “Feature PERMDELTA correction” in DNES section 
5.6.3.3 should be revised to state that nilling of featureLifetime should 
really be done only if the Permdelta represents the commissioning of an 
Event / AIXM feature (at the moment the ADVRs only talk about 
Permdeltas in general). 

○ No other Event / AIXM feature data - The ADVRs in DNES section 
5.6.3.3 state which data the correction timeslice shall contain and 
explicitly says that no other data shall be included except the listed one. 
The list of allowed data should be reviewed. At least the gml:identifier of 
the affected Event / AIXM feature should always be included. In addition, 
aixm:timeSliceMetadata may be relevant and thus should be allowed as 
optional content. For an Event correction Permdelta, textNOTAM data can 
also be relevant. 

○ Baseline data copy correctness - The “Baseline data copy correctness” 
ADVRs in sections 4.8.5 and 4.10.5 of the DNES mention an 
“encompassing aixm:timeInterval”. A telcon with sponsors revealed that 
this actually means that the time interval of the Tempdelta (that copies 
elements from the Baseline - see ADVR for further details) should be 
within the time interval of the Baseline. This should be clarified for both 



OGC 11-092r2 

28 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

ADVRs. It was mentioned that the rule should better be explained with a 
diagram, not only textual. 

● Navaid Unserviceable Scenario: 
○ Operational status allowed values - The “operational status allowed 

values” ADVR in DNES section 4.10.5 only deals with 
“NavaidEquipment”. It appears that the normative statement should also 
include “Navaid”. This would be in line with the data encoding rule ER-
05, which is more generic in that it says that the values 
"FALSE_POSSIBLE" and "CONDITIONAL" cannot be used in the 
scenario at all. The normative statement for the “operational status 
allowed values” ADVR should therefore be reconsidered. 

○ ILS status consistency with Localizer - The table of ER-09 in DNES 
section 4.10.4 does not cover the case described by ADVR “ILS status 
consistency with Localizer” in DNES section 4.10.5. ER-09 should thus 
be reviewed. 

○ ER-07 - The data encoding rule ER-07 in DNES 4.10.4 states: “In the case 
of a Navaid for which all its primary components NavaidEquipment are 
affected (have a temporarily changed operational status), then its 
NavaidOperationalStatus.operationalStatus attribute shall get the value 
specified by the ‘operational status’ input parameter.” - It is unclear what 
the “‘operational status’ input parameter” is. According to sponsors, this 
should be revised to state “... ‘operational status’ value.” 

○ ER-09 - The data encoding rule ER-09 in DNES section 4.10.4 only 
mentions the values UNSERVICEABLE, ON_TEST, 
FALSE_INDICATION and IN_CONSTRUCTION for the operational 
status. The automatic data validation rules list more status types: 
UNSERVICEABLE, ONTEST, INTERRUPT, FALSE_INDICATION, 
DISPLACED, OTHER and IN_CONSTRUCTION. ER-09 should be 
updated to also list all of these status values.

6 Validation Results - Automatic Validation Rules 

6.1 Message Validation Rule Setup 

Only AIXM XML documents that meet certain requirements can be considered as Digital 
NOTAM. Schematron is a useful tool for verifying that an AIXM document is also a 
Digital NOTAM. This section documents the development effort to create these 
schematron rules. 

6.1.1 Schematron File Structure 

The rules that govern Digital NOTAM encoding are broken into the following sections in 
the Schematron document: 

● General Aspects: Covers rules derived from the general definition of Digital 
NOTAM taken from DNES or have been identified in this document. 

● Event Scenarios: NOTAMs describe a limited number of scenarios that require a 
specific set of elements present. These are detailed in the Digital NOTAM Event 
specification, and the Schematron document is broken down into rule patterns that 
target these scenarios. 

6.1.2 Rule Context 

The Schematron rules have been defined with no absolute XPaths. Elements to validate 
are not anticipated in a particular location in the document. Instead any Event element 
that appears is considered a potential Digital NOTAM Event. : 

● As Digital NOTAM messages are XML elements that may be only a part of a 
greater XML document such as a WFS response, the Schematron rules should not 
make assumptions on the structure of the document, only validate Event elements 
where they are found. 

● The Schematron rules can also accommodate multiple Digital NOTAMs in the 
one XML document. 

 
While DNES mentions the AIXMBasicMessage element as a useful container for a 
Digital NOTAM, though this is not mandated so these rules do not require it. 

6.1.3 Multiple Events in a Single Document 

Multiple Digital NOTAM Events may be included in a single XML document that is 
being validated. The Schematron rules must accommodate this, appropriately applying 
rules to each event. 



OGC 11-092r2 

30 Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

6.1.4 Content Unassociated to the Event 

The document being validated may include information not explicitly associated to an 
event in the document via an aixm:extension element. This shifts the validation focus 
from “all content must be related to an event, therefore all content will be tested” to “only 
content related to the event will be tested”. Introduction of rules that state a minimum set 
of information must be related to the event could be introduced. For instance a Navaid 
Unserviceable (NAV.UNS) event must have at least one Navaid or NavaidEquipment 
associated to it. 

6.1.5 External Information Needed to Test Rules 

Schematron relies on using XPath and XSLT to reference the elements to validate, and to 
define the validation rules themselves. In some cases the business rules for a Digital 
NOTAM will need to refer to content that is not available in the document being 
validated, but instead from the originating data source. 

If the Schematron rules are designed to assume that all information is provided in-line 
then required information that is not in-line in the document will not validate.  

If instead the Schematron rules assume all information that could be needed may not be 
in-line and therefore can’t be validated, rules that depend on the in-line information 
would avoid being tested all together. 

The recommended compromise is to ensure the schematron only validates related 
information if it is available in-line. Rules are defined by specifying an XPath and 
validating any elements that match the XPath to a given set of rules. Care needs to be 
taken that these XPaths will not attempt to apply rules to missing elements, by applying 
these rules only if it the dependent information is present. 

With this approach, rules that depend on information that may not be in-line will be 
validated if it has been embedded and ignored if it has not. Though this approach does 
not identify that some content may not have been validated, it is recommended as the best 
compromise for each potential situation. 

Keep in mind that information that must be present will still be tested. This case only 
covers information that may not be present. 

6.1.5.1 Validating TEMPDELTA against BASELINE / PERMDELTA 

The most common situation that highlights the issue outlined above is when validating a 
TEMPDELTA against BASELINE / PERMDELTA information. Having access to 
tempdeltas, permdeltas and baselines of feature data may be difficult (for the schematron 
based validation) if that data is not supplied in the same XML instance document that is 
passed to the validator. 



OGC 11-092r2 

Copyright © 2011 Open Geospatial Consortium. 31 
 

Some programmatic solution can certainly be designed, such as the validation tool being 
aware of the data source of the data being validated and how to query it for missing 
information. 

This would most likely take the form of a WFS service, and could be more easily 
facilitated by allowing for this content to be in-line in the document. An alternative is 
some kind of WFS request inside the document to get the AIXM feature data via 
identifier would allow retrieval of the necessary information for validator 
implementations that support this. 

6.2 Validation Coverage 

One goal of the validation work was to make the work on schematron rules for automated 
testing of DNES requirements more visible. This has been done by documenting which 
requirements / normative statements from the DNES have been covered through 
schematron rules created in OWS-8. 

Due to resource constraints, primarily the statements from scenarios with high sponsor 
priority were considered. The following list shows the scenarios sorted (in OWS-8) 
according to sponsor priority, in descending order: 

1. Navaid unserviceable 
2. Aerodrome closure 
3. Runway closure 
4. Other Event 
5. Published special activity area – activation 
6. Taxiway closure 
7. Airport surface contamination 
8. Published special activity area – creation 
9. Ad-hoc ATS airspace – creation 
10. Route portion closure 
11. Route portion opening 
12. New obstacle 
13. Published ATS airspace - activation & deactivation 

Schematron rules cover general rules from the DNES as well as rules specific for the first 
four scenarios in the list. See the coverage tables in Annex A – Validation Coverage for 
further details. 

6.2.1 Gaps in Automatic Validation Rules 

There are common situations where XML Schema and Schematron alone cannot provide 
automated validation for a given rule. This section lists these common situations. 

Some normative statements require data that is not included in the document being 
validated, as discussed in the Handling External Information Needed to Test Rules 
section above. 



OGC 11-092r2

6.2.2 Status of the XML Schema Files 

The validation tool also performs XML Schema validation, but the package had difficulty 
using the schema files as they were presented. This was circumvented by making local 
manual changes to the schema files to allow Xerces (the XML parser / validation package 
used) to use them: 

● Comments after the XML declaration (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-
8"?>) but before the opening element caused a “Content is not allowed in prolog” 
validation error. This affected the following files which had comments moved to 
below the schema element opening tag. 

○ AIXM_Features.xsd 
○ AIXM_DataTypes.xsd 
○ AIXM_AbstractGML_ObjectTypes.xsd 

● ISO_19139_Schemas\gco\basicTypes.xsd caused the error “The targetNamespace 
of the referenced schema, currently 'http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2', must be 
identical to that of the including schema, currently 
'http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gco'”. This was due to a namespace clash with a 
basicTypes.xsd file in the GML namespace. To resolve this locally the file name 
of the GCO XSD was changed to gco_basicTypes.xsd. This is likely indicative of 
a problem in the validation software’s resolution of XSD resources, not in the 
XSD files themselves.

7 Accomplishments 

● Conceptual issues within the proposed release version of DNES 1.0 were 
identified and documented. Where feasible, recommendations were made for 
solving these issues. 

● A number of improvements - regarding both conceptual aspects and the way that 
the DNES is written - were identified and documented. 

● Schematron rule sets for the automatic validation of DNOTAM Events were 
developed. The rule design offers a great level of flexibility in the way that such 
Events are included in XML documents. This enables automated validation of 
DNOTAM Events in various applications, re-using the same rule set. 

● Normative statements in the DNES were identified and documented together with 
information about coverage of the statements by schematron rules. This allows 
DNES users to determine if a specific statement can be validated automatically. It 
also provides a way to better link the schematron rules and the DNES.

8 Annex A – Validation Coverage 

The tables contained in this chapter provide information on which normative statements 
in the DNES can automatically be tested with schematron rules developed in OWS-8. 
Due to resource constraints, primarily the statements from scenarios with high sponsor 
priority were considered. 

The coverage tables are structured as follows: 

● The first column identifies the relevant normative statement2. 
● The second column identifies the source of the statement, which is usually a 

specific section or table of the DNES. 
● The third column contains the identifier(s) of the schematron rule(s) that are used 

to check the statement on a given DNOTAM. An explanation is given in those 
cases where no schematron rule is available (yet) to check the statement. 3

2) Note that even though the DNES itself is not normative (as explained in chapter 5, it is currently considered only as 
guidance material) the rule statements in the DNES regarding encoding and use of a DNOTAM themselves are still 
normative for applications that are implemented according to the DNES. 

3) As these rules are associated to the section numbers in the DNES, it would be ideal if future versions of DNES did 
not drastically alter the section numbering scheme. New scenarios should be appended to the end of section 4 so the 
section numbering of the current scenarios is not affected.

ER-08: It is recommended that an alphanumeric

facilitate it's identification on graphical 
representations (such as airspace activity maps) and 
verbal communication. The composition rule is 
derived from the ICAO Annex 15 rules for P, D, R 
area designators: CCLnnnn-yy, where: 

● CC is the Country Code; this could be 
expanded into a full FIR identifier if 
necessary to have a finer granularity of the 
airspace reference; 

● L is a letter that corresponds to the area type; 
● nnnn is a number, unduplicated during the 

same year, within the State or territory 
concerned; this could also be the NOTAM 
number; 

● yy are the last two digits of the year date 
when the area becomes effective 

DNES 4.4.4 TBD

ER-01: in case a full runway is concerned by the 
closure, then a TEMPDELTA shall be encoded 
for each of its RunwayDirections. 

DNES 4.9.4 This statement is 
normative for 
operators. Automated 
tests cannot check 
this if they do not 
have knowledge of 
the event that 
triggered 
RunwayDirections to 
be closed. What can 
be recognized is that 
multiple 
RunwayDirection 
Tempdeltas are 
provided and that 
their usedRunway is 
identical - this would 
give a hint that the 
full runway is closed. 
See automatic data 
validation rule 
“Identical closure for 
all runway 
directions” for further 
details. 

ER-02: One ManoeuvringAreaAvailability 
element having operationalStatus=CLOSED shall 
be included in each RunwayDirection 
TEMPDELTA. If the runway is "closed except 
for" specified operations, flight and/or aircraft 
categories, all specified excepted operations shall
