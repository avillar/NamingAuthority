1 Background 

The OpenGIS has been a precursor in Web Services matter, nevertheless, the pattern that 
has been used is not recognized by the industry as a standard “XML Web Services”. The 
work done during the the OpenGIS Web Service 2 initiative has provided the OpenGIS 
with interfaces that use the XML-related technologies supported by the industry, as 
SOAP for the communication protocol, WSDL for the interface description language, and 
UDDI for registering and searching services. 

This change proposal present the required change to the WCS specification to 
interoperate with the industry standards.

3 Proposal 

 

Change Request 1: Define fixed parameter names for the Range subsetting names and 
values parameters. 

 

3.1.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
Subclause 9.2.2.1, 9.2.2.9, getCoverage.xsd. 

 

3.1.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  

Change the KVP encoding to ensure that the parameter names used in request are fixed in 
the interface definition and are not subject to the content provided by the WCS anymore. 

 

3.1.3 Reason for change: 

WSDL does not support the definition of dynamic parameter names, all parameters have 
to be defined at interface description stage.  
 
3.1.4 Specific Suggested Changes: 



The WCS 1.0 GetCoverage operation requires the use of dynamic parameter names for 
the range subseting (e.g. BAND=...) making exhaustive definition of the parameter names 
impossible in interface description languages (and a fortiori in WSDL). 

The intent is to change the GetCoverage request parameters definition to use fixed 
paramater names for the Range subseting names and values. 

For example : 

&GroundTemperature=0/10&AirTemperature=-5/0,5/10 

becomes 

AXISNAMES=GroundTemperature,AirTemperature&AXISVALUES=0/10,(-5/0,5/10) 

 

AXISNAMES parameter values are comma separated.  

AXISVALUES parameter values are comma separated, complex values are enclosed in 
bracket. 

 

3.1.4.1 Update Table 9 

 

Remove 

 

2 © Open Geospatial Consortium (2005)

PARAMETER= val1,val2,…& 

or 

PARAMETER= min/max/res 

(Included only for range sets with 
compound values) 

Request a range subset defined by 
constraining parameter PARAMETER. The 
PARAMETER key is a variable string; it 
must match the name of a parameter listed 
in the range set description of the selected 
coverage. For instance: 

band=1,5,3 (e.g., radiance values in bands 
1, 5, 3) 

age=0/18 (e.g., counts of people with ages 
under 18 yrs.) 

 



Open Geospatial Consortium (2005) 
3 

Optional if the chosen range component has 
default values for the parameter. 

 

 

 

And replace by 

 

AXISNAMES=name1,name2,… A list of string which must match the name 
of a parameter listed in the range set 
description of the selected coverage. 

For instance: 

AXISNAMES= GroundTemperature, 
AirTemperature 

AXISVALUES=value1,value2,… A list of values (simple or complex) that 
contraint the range component that has been 
defined using the AXISNAMES parameter. 

For instance: 

AXISVALUES=0/10,(-5/0,5/10) 

 

Note that both AXISNAMES and AXISVALUES 
must have the same number of items. 

 

3.1.4.2 Update section 9.2.2.9 

 

Replace section 9.2.2.9 by 

 

If the range set of the selected coverage consists of compound values, GetCoverage 

requests may include constraints defined on the parameter(s) of the compound range set. 

 

Such constraints are expressed using tow parameters, AXISNAMES and AXISVALUES, 
where 

© 



a) Each item of the list of string in AXISNAMES matches the name of an 
AxisDescription element defined on that range set, and 

b) Each corresponding value in AXISVALUES is one of the acceptable values defined in 
the corresponding AxisDescription element. 

 

Using constraint is optional if the selected range set has a default value on the 
corresponding AxisDescription. 

 

3.1.5 Consequences of the change 

This change will allow description of the WCS interface using interface description 
language and in particular WSDL. 

 

3.1.6 Consequences if not approved 

Without this modification it would be impossible to use WSDL to describe the WCS 
interface. 

 

_________________________________ 
 

Change Request 2: Add a normative WSDL description as a Annex to the WCS 
specification. 

 

3.2.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
Annex shall include WSDL definition and schema folder shall include wcs_abstract.wsdl 
and wcs.wsdl, as well as the common schemas as provided by OWS 2 Common 
Architecture work. 

 

3.2.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  

Add WSDL description as a normative part to the specification. 

 

3.2.3 Reason for change: 

4 © Open Geospatial Consortium (2005)
 



To provide the normative definition of the WSDL description of the WCS interface to be 
used each time a WCS is describe using this language. 
 
3.2.4 Specific Suggested Changes: 
Add a WSDL description of WCS as an Annex to the document and provide the 
electronic description integrated with the existing XSD description. OWS 2 Common 
Architecture has published such integrated schemas and WSDL documents. 

 

3.2.5 Consequences of the change 

WCS implementation shall use this WSDL definition to describe their WCS instances 
ensuring a better interoperability of the WCS interface while using the commonly used 
WSDL technology. 

 

3.2.6 Consequences if not approved 

Different WCS provide might define different way to describe WCS interface using 
WSDL reducing the interoperability of the interface. 

_________________________________ 
 

Change Request 3: Add a clear normative clause that state WSDL definition shall be 
used by all service providers that make a WSDL description available. 

 

3.3.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
??? 

 

3.3.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  

Add a normative clause that explain the intended use of the WSDL. 

 

3.3.3 Reason for change: 

It is important to explain the intended use of the normative WSDL description to avoid 
misused. 
 
3.3.4 Specific Suggested Changes: 
Add a normative clause saying:

5 



“All WCS service described using a WSDL document shall use the standard WSDL as 
described in Annex X. It is not required to import the document provided by the 
OpenGIS but it is required to use exactly the same definition as in the provided WSDL. ” 

 

Note: This part should probably be part of OWS Common specification 

 

3.3.5 Consequences of the change 

WCS instances describe using WSDL will use the standard WSDL, improving 
interoperability. 

 

3.3.6 Consequences if not approved 

Different WCS providers might define different way to describe WCS interface using 
WSDL reducing the interoperability of the interface. 

 

Change Request 4: Include an optional link from the Capabilities to the WSDL. 

 

3.4.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
N/A 

 

3.4.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  

This optional link will ease discovery and use of WSDL description. 

 

3.4.3 Reason for change: 

The access to a WSDL description may facilitate the binding phase of Web Service 
access. 
 
3.4.4 Summary of change: 
Add an element in the Capabilities document that refers to the WSDL. 

 

3.4.5 Consequences of the change 

A link to the WSDL description will be available in the Capabilities document.

3.4.6 Consequences if not approved 

There will be no way the advertise in the Capabilities that a service is described by a 
WSDL document. 

 

Change Request 5: Include the description of the SOAP binding. 

 

3.4.1 Affected section(s), table(s), figure(s):  
Adding SOAP support require creation of a new section. Proposal is to add a section 
6.3.5 SOAP that is presented here under. 

 

6.3.5 SOAP 

A Web Map Service may support the “SOAP” protocol. 

The implementation of the SOAP protocol is using document/literal encoding and the 
messages are the one defined in the Annex E of this document. 

There is two step in supporting SOAP, 

 Adding definition of the SOAP binding to the WSDL description of the service 
 Adding support for SOAP document/literal envelope

6.3.5.2 Declaring SOAP support in Capabilities 

8 © Open Geospatial Consortium (2005)
 



SOAP support shall be declared in the Capabilities of the services. This will allow usage of 
SOAP independently of WSDL. 

If SOAP is supported, the services shall advertise  

<DCPType> 

   <HTTP> 

     ……. 

     <SOAP 
onlineResource="http://webservices.ionicsoft.com/ionicweb/wfs/BOSTON_SHAPE?"/> 

  </HTTP> 

</DCPType> 

 

6.3.5.3 SOAP document/literal envelope 

A Web Map Service that support SOAP binding shall accept document/literal SOAP 
messages which contains a message as defined in the XML encoding for Web Map Service. 
It is not required for the Web Map Service to support any other feature or extension of the 
SOAP protocol.

   … 
  </Operation>  
 </env:Body> 
</env:Envelope> 

 

If the result of the operation is an XML document, it shall be included in a SOAP 
envelope as well, 

 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<env:Envelope 
xmlns:env=”http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/”> 
 <env:Body> 
  <Result>

  </Result>  
 </env:Body> 
</env:Envelope> 

 

If the result is a Binary, the content of the Body is not specified and the binary is attached 
to the SOAP message using SOAP with attachement [SOAP-Attachement]. 
Implementation may use the Body as a container for metadata about the result.

3.4.2 Purpose of the proposed change:  

This change aims to add support for SOAP document/literal binding. 

 

3.4.3 Reason for change: 

The W3C standard way of doing web services is WSDL/SOAP/UDDI. Adding SOAP 
support will increase the potential user base of this specification. 

 

3.4.4 Summary of change: 
This change add support for SOAP.  
 
3.4.5 Consequences of the change 

The WCS interface will support SOAP binding. 

 

3.4.6 Consequences if not approved 

The industry standard for web services is WSDL/SOAP/UDDI, leaving the WCS without 
support for these is a thread for its mid-term adoption.
