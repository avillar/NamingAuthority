i. Abstract 
This document specifies a Name Type Specification (NTS) for predefined, combined, and 
parameterized Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definitions. This NTS augments the /def/ 
namespace with http URI definitions for CRSs. The NTS is based on the Name Type Specification – 
definitions – part 1 – basic name [OGC 09-048r3] and supersedes OGC document “Definition 
identifier URNs in OGC namespace” [OGC 07-092r3]. 

NTSs are maintained by the OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA). 

This document includes one Annex: a user guide to the OGC CRS resolver. 

ii. Keywords 
The following are keywords to be used by search engines and document catalogues. 

Coordinate Reference System, CRS, CRS identifiers, EPSG

OGC® Name Type Specification for Coordinate Reference Systems  

1 Scope  

This OGC Best Practice document defines a syntax, based on http URIs, for identifying Coordinate 
Reference Systems (CRSs), including compound  and parameterized CRSs. Strings conforming to 
this syntax are called CRS URIs. The semantics of such definitions is established by the OGC registry 
service. The specification on hand does not define concrete URIs, it only establishes an URI scheme; 
definition of CRS URIs based on this scheme, such as temporal CRSs, is done separately within 
OGC. 

As OGC’s mission centers around location-based data and services, practically all OGC 
specifications make heavy use of CRSs to relate object locations in space and time to some reference 
position. A vast amount of different definitions is in practical use, covering horizontal (geodetic) 
extents, height, and time. New definitions arise, such as in planetary sciences.  

For all of these CRSs, a simple, expressive, and http compatible mechanism is required allowing 
software to create, identify, and understand CRSs and their definitions. This document establishes a 
convention for naming CRSs within OGC. In particular, the scheme supports the following use cases: 

 CRSs with a normatively fixed definition are addressable by a unique URI; e.g., the WGS84 
CRS can be identified through http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326; 

 Shorthands are possible for enumerating a family of supported CRSs; for example, a server 
supporting the complete EPSG list of CRSs should be able to express this with one URI, such 
as http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/, rather than having to enumerate the whole list of 
thousands of CRSs; 

 Ad-hoc derivations from CRSs are expressible (see, e.g., the WCS Core), such as the result of 
an x/t slicing through an x/y/t datacube through a WCS or WCPS operation; 

 Spatio-temporal CRSs can be established by combining existing CRS definitions; for 
example, 3-D georeferenced image timeseries can be described through a combination of 2-D 
WGS84 CRS and some 1-D time CRS. 

 Coordinate system axes can be referenced using their names as defined in the CRSs on hand, 
such as latitude, in operations like spatio-temporal subsetting, thereby enabling semantic 
checks for admissible axis names by services. 

 The naming scheme is, without reservation, backwards compatible to OGC’s pre-existing 
URL scheme. 



OGC 11-135r2

 The naming scheme does not prejudicate any particular CRS definitions, but remains open to 
any kind of CRSs that may appear in future. 

 The naming scheme does not assume one central CRS resolver but supports any number of 
independently maintained CRS resolvers. 

This CRS URI naming scheme is implemented by the OGC CRS resolver1 since March 2013. 

2 Conformance  

For the sake of clarity, this document follows the OGC modular specification style; requirements 
highlighted in grey boxes constitute the normative information. However, as this document is not an 
OGC standard it does not contain a corresponding Abstract Test Suite (ATS) Annex. 

This document establishes one requirements class, crs-nts, of URI http://www.opengis.net/spec/CRS-
NTS/1.0/req/crs-nts. The complete specification consists of the document, accessible under this URL, 
plus the XML Schema available from http://schemas.opengis.net/schemas/crs-nts/. 

Standardisation target of all requirements and conformance classes are HTTP URIs. 

Requirements defined in this document are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/CRS-NTS/1.0/. 

3 Normative references 

An OGC name may be provided for a definition of a type of object broadly classified as a "concept" 
or system parameter. The precise scope of definitions that may be identified with OGC Names is 
provided by the set of items in the register at http://urn.opengis.net/register/OGC-NA/deftype. 

This Name Type Specification for CRSs is available for download from 
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/bp/. 

The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this text, constitute 
provisions of this specification. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, or revisions of, any 
of these publications do not apply. For undated references, the latest edition of the normative 
document referred to applies.

5 Terms and definitions 

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in Clause 3 apply and, in addition, 
the following terms and definitions. An arrow “ “ indicates that the term following it is defined else-
where in this Clause 5. 

5.1 Axis definition 

GML fragment whose root is in the substitution group of gml:CoordinateSystemAxis as 
defined in [OGC 07-036] 

5.2 Axis identifier 

URI resolving to exactly one well-known Axis definition 

5.3 CRS 

Coordinate Reference System 

5.4 CRS axis 

fixed reference line of a CRS identified by its Axis identifier and described in its Axis definition 

5.5 CRS definition 

GML fragment whose root is in the substitution group of gml:AbstractCRS as defined in [OGC 07-
036] 

5.6 CRS Identifier 

URI resolving to exactly one well-known CRS definition 

Note This can be either a CRS in the substitution group of type gml:AbstractCRS or a Parameterized CRS 
in the substitution group of crsnts:ParameterizedCRS where all parameters are saturated either 
via values provided in the URI or through default values provided in the Parameterized CRS definition. 
See Clause 10. 

Example The WGS84 CRS has this CRS Identifier registered with OGC: 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326  
This is equivalent to: 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs?authority=EPSG&version=0&code4326  
See Clause 7 for the syntax and semantics definition. 

5.7 Compound CRS 

sequence of two or more single CRSs 



OGC  11-135r2 
 

5 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Note Several constraints need to be fulfilled by a compound CRS (which is taken from OGC Abstract Topic 2 
[OGC 08-015r2]); however, as the detailed CRS semantics is not a focus of this specification, these 
constraints are not addressed here. 

5.8 Parameterized CRS 

CRS boilerplate which, when provided with concrete values for all its formal parameters, resembles 
a CRS definition 

6 Conventions 

6.1 Namespace prefix conventions 

The following namespaces are used in this document. The prefix abbreviations used constitute 
conventions used here, but are not normative. The namespaces to which the prefixes refer are 
normative, however. 

Table 1 — Namespace mappings 

Prefix Namespace URI Description 

xsd http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema  XML Schema namespace 

gml http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.2  GML 3.2.1 

crsnts http://www.opengis.net/CRS-NTS/1.0 CRS Name Type Specification 

 

Note the crsnts namespace is only needed for dealing with Parameterized CRSs as described in Clause 10. 
It is not needed for handling CRS URIs, nor is it needed for handling GML CRS definitions. 

6.2 BNF notation 

BNF notation used is the same as in IETF RFC 2396 [3].

7 CRS definition and identifier 

7.1 Overview 

This Clause establishes requirements class crs-nts. This is the mandatory core conformance class of 
this specification. 

When expressing the location of some object in space and time through coordinates, these coordinates 
need to have an unambiguous reference which usually is given by a Coordinate Reference System 
(CRS). Typically, however, it is inconvenient for both producer and consumer of such information to 
communicate the complete definition of the CRS used; rather, a unique identifier is preferred – even 
more so as the vast majority of applications relies on some community accepted standard CRSs. 

The OWS Common standard [OGC 06-121r9] specifies that each specific OGC Web Service shall 
always reference a CRS by using a XML attribute or element with the type anyURI. Such an 
anyURI value can be used to reference a CRS whether or not the definition of that CRS is included 
in the same data transfer and whether or not can be accessed electronically from some server. 
Subclause 10.3.2 of OWS Common [OGC 06-121r9] specifies when and how to use URLs to 
reference a CRS or CRS-related object; subclause D.14 summarizes many of the requirements for 
referencing CRSs.  

This OGC® Name Type Specification for Coordinate Reference Systems specification establishes a 
syntax for such anyURI items. In its basic form, a URI uniquely identifies a CRS (see Clause 7). 
Through a parametrization mechanism, the mere identification is extended beyond single CRS 
Identifiers to also express sets of CRSs, instantiations obtained from Parameterized CRSs, and ad-hoc 
combination of CRS components. This document does not specify where these different CRS URI 
mechanisms are allowed; for example, OGC specifications may allow Parameterized URIs in some 
places, and sometimes require Unique CRS URIs.  

Example A typical situation occurs with the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) [OGC 09-110r4]. Its CRS 
Extension [OGC 11-053] allows incompletely specified CRS URIs in the Capabilities document, thereby 
enabling a compact presentation of the CRSs supported by a particular service. In a GetCoverage 
request, on the other hand, a unique CRS URI must be passed to the server to concretely specify the 
coordinate transformation to be applied. 

7.3 Syntax 

7.3.1 General CRS Identifier syntax 

Requirement 1 req/query-format: 
A CRS Identifier shall conform with the URL format as defined in IETF RFC 2396 [3]: 
  [ ”http:” hier_part [ ”?” query ] ] [ ”#” fragment ] 

Requirement 2 req/reserved-chars: 
In a CRS Identifier, characters in values which are reserved in [OGC 09-048r3] shall be encoded in 
the percent notation defined in IETF RFC 2396 [3]. 



OGC  11-135r2 
 

7 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Example 1 A coverage document may contain a local CRS definition referred to by the srsName attribute: 
srsName=”#my_local_CRS” 

Example 2 Company ACME may offer CRS definitions (i.e., employ a CRS Identifier resolver) understanding CRS 
URLs like http://www.acme.com/def/this-is-EPSG-4326. 

Example 3 The following URL resolves to a set of CRSs, namely all EPSG CRSs, in their current version, available 
in the OGC CRS Name Resolver: http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/. 

Note Generally, not all possible parameter values will identify some existing (or meaningful) CRS. The 
authoritative decision about validity of OGC CRS URIs is with the OGC CRS Name Resolver with 
service endpoint www.opengis.net/def. 

Example 1 The OGC CRS Name Resolver returns a GML CRS definition of the WGS84 reference system when 
provided with URL http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326. 

Example 2 The OGC CRS Name Resolver returns a 404 error code when provided with URL 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/this-is-not-a-valid EPSG-identifier. 

7.3.2 GET/KVP format 

Requirement 3 req/query-format: 
A CRS Identifier in GET/KVP format shall be constructed as an http GET query, following  the 
common URL format as defined in IETF RFC 2396 [3]: 
  ”http:” hier_part  ”?” par1 ”=” val1 ”&” par2 ”=” val2 ”&” … 
where par1, par2 etc. represent parameter names and val1, val2, etc. the value passed for the 
corresponding parameter as described in Table 2. 

Note Like URIs in general [3], the domain part is case insensitive while the path and query part is case 
sensitive. 

Admissible parameters for the query part (i.e., following the “?” character) in a given CRS or set of 
CRSs are those given by the service and by the individual CRS(s) interrogated, therefore individual. 
Table 2 lists CRS URI parameters reserved by OGC, together with their meanings. A particular CRS 
may define further parameters, as long as these do not conflict with the definitions of this standard. 

Every parameter value can be instantiated only once, i.e., duplicate keys are not allowed. 

Requirement 4 req/no-dupes: 
A CRS Identifier shall not contain duplicate keys. 

Example The following does not identify a CRS, but an (infinite) CRS set because the CenterLatitude 
parameter is not provided (cf. Annex A): 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs?authority=OGC&version=1.3&code=AUTO42003& 
UoM=m&CenterLongitude=-100 

Note A CRS URI which does not specify authority, version, and code will result in a list of all CRSs matching 
this pattern; in particular, if none of these components is specified the resolver will return all CRS 
definitions known to this service. In case of a client side programming bug this would constitute an 
undesirable behaviour as the amount of data presumably will be substantial. A server, therefore, may 
implement internal limits in the amount of information delivered and respond with an exception upon 
transgression of this limit.

Note The version format is sometimes of syntax “N.N.N” or “N.N”, where each “N” stands for an integer. 
No "v" or other version prefix is used by OGC. If no other version identification is provided by the 
authority, a four-digit year or other date can be used.  

7.3.3 Path format 

In the special case that the CRS identifier is one of 

 Authority, but no version nor code; 

 authority and version, but no code; 

 authority and version and code, 

the path variant, i.e., a RESTful syntax, can be used alternatively to the query syntax.  

Requirement 5 req/path-format: 
A CRS Identifier in path format, that is: 
  ”http:” hier_part ”/” AUTHORITY ”/” VERSION ”/” CODE 
shall be equivalent to 
  ”http:” hier_part ”?” “authority” ”=” AUTHORITY 
                    ”&” “version” ”=” VERSION 
                    ”&” “code” ”=” CODE 

 
where the placeholders AUTHORITY, VERSION, and CODE denote admissible values for the correspond-
ing lower-case variable parts defined in Table 2.

Example 1 The two URIs below are equivalent in identifying the WGS84 CRS: 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326  
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs?authority=EPSG&version=0&code=4326 

Example 2 The URI for the OGC CRS with code 4326 specified in the EPSG database [2] can be expressed as 
?http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326  

Example 3 The URI for all OGC / EPSG CRSs in the EPSG database [2] can be expressed as 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG  

Example 4 A fictitious oarganization, ACME, might establish its own proprietary EPSG 4326 definition through 
http://www.acme.com/def/this-is-EPSG-4326. 

Note This syntax establishes backward compatibility to pre-existing OGC CRS URIs. 

7.4 Semantics 

The semantics of a CRS URI is given by the response obtained from the server receiving and 
resolving the URI. Depending on the completeness of the CRS URI, different cases are possible: 

 If the CRS URI references a complete CRS definition by containing authority, version, 
and code parameters identifying a GML document whose root is in the substitution group of  
gml:AbstractCRS) then the response is this CRS definition. 

 If in the CRS URI references a set of definitions by leaving out one or more of the 
authority, version, and code parts then the response is an unordered sequence of CRS 
definitions, with one definition for each value combination available on the server. 

Requirement 6 req/representation-complete-crs: 
The resource pertaining to a CRS URI which identifies a CRS whose root is in the substitution group 
of  gml:AbstractCRS shall be the definition of the CRS identified.  

Requirement 7 req/representation-crs-list: 
The resource pertaining to a CRS URI referring to CRS definition , but with either code or version 
and code or authority, version, and code parameters missing in the URI shall be a 
crnts:CRSList containing exactly those CRS definitions stored in the server which match the 
CRS URI and where the missing parameters act as wildcards matching any value. 

CRS and CRS list responses are expressed in GML. 

Requirement 8 req/representation-gml-default: 
By default, the representation delivered in response to a CRS Identifier shall be encoded in GML 
[OGC 07-036].  

Note In future, further encodings beyond GML may be supported, such as WKT. 

Example 1 A GML document describing the WGS84 reference system can be obtained through URL  
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326 



OGC 11-135r2

Example 2 The following URL does not provide a value for parameter CenterLongitude and, hence, will return 
the Parameterized CRS definition, which has as its document root a crsnts:ParameterizedCRS 
element:  
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs?authority=OGC&version=1.3&code=AUTO42003&UoM=m 

8 Axis identifiers 

8.1 Overview 

Coordinate system axes can be spatial (example: latitude, elevation), temporal, or none of both (ex-
ample: pressure). While these concepts are uniquely defined, they frequently have several synonyms, 
for example, elevation is synonymous to bathymetry, altitude, height, and z. Likewise, CRS Axis 
URIs uniquely define axes for use in CRS definitions, but allow synonyms. 

8.2 Syntax 

Requirement 9 req/path-format: 
A CRS Axis Identifier shall be a URL which has the common URL format as defined in IETF RFC 
2396 [3]: 
  [ ”http:” hier_part [ ”?” query ] ] [ ”#” fragment ] 

Note Following URI construction rules [3], parameter keys in the query are case insensitive, while values are 
case sensitive.  

Example 1 A coverage document may contain a local CRS definition containing a locally defined axis referred to by 
#my_local_z_axis. 

Example 2 Company ACME may offer CRS definitions (i.e., employ a CRS Identifier resolver) understanding CRS 
URLs like http://www.acme.com/def/axis/this-is-latitude. 

Example 3 The OGC definition of longitude is retrieved through this URL when passed to the OGC CRS Resolver: 
http://www.opengis.net/def/axis-name/EPSG/0/9902. 

Requirement 10 req/reserved-chars: 
In an Axis Identifier, characters in values which are reserved in [OGC 09-048r3] shall be encoded in 
the percent notation defined in IETF RFC 2396 [3]. 

8.3 Semantics 

Requirement 11 req/semantics: 
The resource identified by an Axis Identifier shall be the GML representation of the coordinate axis 
identified, as a GML document with root element gml:CoordinateSystemAxis. 

Example Axis URL http://www.opengis.net/def/axis/elevation identifies this axis: 

<gml:CoordinateSystemAxis gml:id="ogrcrs4" gml:uom="urn:ogc:def:uom:EPSG::9904"> 
  <gml:name>elevation</gml:name> 
  <gml:axisID> 
    <gml:name gml:codeSpace="urn:ogc:def:axis:EPSG::">9904</gml:name> 
  </gml:axisID> 



OGC  11-135r2 
 

11 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

  <gml:axisAbbrev>z</gml:axisAbbrev> 
  <gml:axisDirection>up</gml:axisDirection> 
</gml:CoordinateSystemAxis> 

Axis definitions contain an element gml:AxisAbbrev which defines a short name for an axis. When 
this name is unambiguous (e.g., when the CRS under consideration is specified additionally) this axis 
abbreviation can be used in place of the full URI axis identifier. 

Requirement 12 req/abbreviation: 
In a context where the CRS on hand is defined unambiguously, using an identifier URI of one of the 
axes defined in said CRS shall be equivalent to any of the axis abbreviations defined in the CRS 
referenced or in some <gml:AxisAbbrev> element within  the axis definition referenced by the axis 
URI. 

Example The WGS84 CRS, and geographic CRSs in general, adopts the geodetic latitude axis, identified by  
http://www.opengis.net/def/axis/EPSG/0/106. This axis uses measures in degrees (e.g. referenced as 
deg, as by uom attribute http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/EPSG/0/9122). It is abbreviated as Lat whose 
name is stated as Geodetic latitude in the axis definition (http://www.opengis.net/def/axis-
name/EPSG/0/9901). Thus, the envelope of a coverage in the geographic space can be described as 
follows: 

<gmlcov:GridCoverage … gml:id="C0001"> 
    <gml:boundedBy> 
        <gml:Envelope 
          srsName="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326” 
          axisLabels="Lat Long" 
          uomLabels="deg deg" 
          srsDimension="2"> 
            <gml:lowerCorner>1 1</gml:lowerCorner> 
            <gml:upperCorner>3 10</gml:upperCorner> 
        </gml:Envelope> 
    </gml:boundedBy> 
    … 
</gmlcov:GridCoverage> 

A CRS must not contain the same axis identification twice. Should a CRS need to contain two axis of 
the same kind – e.g., two temporal dimensions as used in climate simulation – then the axis 
abbreviation must be changed for one to be different. 

Requirement 13 req/compatibility: 
In a CRS Identifier, any given axis shall not occur more than once. 

 Example An axis renaming can be done by way of query parameters over a Parameterized CRS definition (cf. 
Clause 10) which targets the reference CRS. Assuming a (hypothetical, not existing) Parameterized CRS 
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/myAuth/myVersion/my-EPSG-4267  has been created, enabling axes 
abbreviations' customization on the target CRS http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4267 (2D 
NAD27 CRS) via parameters called lat-label and long-label, then the following URI renames 
the axis abbreviation to myPersonalLatitudeLabel and myPersonalLongitudeLabel: 

http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/myAuth/myVersion/my-EPSG-4267?lat-
label=myPersonalLatitudeLabel&long-label=myPersonalLongitudeLabel 

 An envelope GML description would then be:

9 Compound CRS 

9.1 Overview 

A Compound CRS is a CRS consisting of a non-repeating sequence of two or more single coordinate 
reference systems, none of which can itself be compound, as defined in OGC Abstract Topic 2 / ISO 
19111-2 [OGC 08-015r2]. This way, Compound CRSs allow to establish higher-dimensional CRSs. 
This Clause describes a URI-based naming scheme for Compound CRSs. 

9.2 Syntax 

A special case of a CRS URI is when the parameter value provided itself is a URI, such as CRSs and 
coordinate axes. 

A Compound CRS URI is a CRS Identifier  with code crs-compound, together with further 
numbered parameters whose values are URIs themselves. A Compound CRS URI describes 
recombination of CRSs into a new CRS.  

Requirement 14 req/format: 
A CRS Identifier in Compound CRS URI format shall contain a path element crs-compound. 

Requirement 15 req/input-crs-list: 
A CRS Identifier in Compound CRS URI format shall contain n>1 query parameters with keys “1” 
through “n” (in decimal notation) whose corresponding values are CRS Identifiers. 

Requirement 16 req/predefined-crs-only: 
A CRS Identifier in Compound CRS URI format shall, in its query parameters, only contain CRS 
Identifiers for complete CRSs, i.e., CRSs whose root element is in the substitution group of 
gml:AbstractCRS. 

Requirement 17 req/no-duplicates: 
A CRS Identifier in Compound CRS URI format shall not contain duplicate CRS Identifiers in the 
numbered query parameters. 



OGC  11-135r2 
 

13 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Note 1 A CRS Identifier, regardless of whether expressed in query or path format, may contain additional query 
parameters, as long as no parameter name conflicts occur. 

Note 2 There does not need to pre-exist any well-known CRS definition matching this new CRS. 

Example Obtaining pressure/time slices from a 4D latitude/longitude/time/pressure atmospheric data cube requires 
a pressure/time CRS, for which no CRS standard exists. A Compound CRS allows to express a CRS 
identifier for this situation. 

Requirement 18 req/unique-axes: 
In a Compound CRS URI, all axes in the CRSs listed shall be pairwise different. 

Note Axes can be the same (e.g., Northing) while their identifiers are distinct. 

Example 1 To define a 3D spatio-temporal CRS for satellite image time series, with axis order latitude-longitude-
time, the WGS84 CRS may be combined with a temporal CRS, such as ansi-date2: 
   http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-compound? 
       1=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326 
    &2=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ansi-date 

Example 2 The URI for combining the CRSs EPSG 4269 (NAD83) and EPSG 5713 (Canadian Geodetic Vertical 
Datum of 1928), adding in height, is: 
  http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-compound? 
      1=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4269 
    &2=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/5713 

Requirement 19 req/axis-sequence: 
In the CRS definition resulting from resolving a Compound CRS, axes shall appear in the order (i) of 
the query parameters listed in the URI and (ii) of the axis order within each CRS listed. 

Example In a request like  
   http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-compound?1=crs1&2=crs2 
 where crs1 has axis order (a,b) and crs2 has axis order (c,d), the resulting CRS will have an axis order of 
(a,b,c,d). 

10 Parameterized CRS 

10.1 Overview 

A Parameterized CRS is a CRS which contains variables.  

10.2 Syntax 

A Parameterized CRS definition consists of a reference to a CRS definition plus a list of parameter 
names (i.e., variables) and optional default values. A Parameterized CRS URI can contain a query 
part with a list of key/value pairs where values are assigned to variables defined in the Parameterized 
CRS. 

                                                   
2 This CRS is not yet adopted by OGC; hence, it may end up having a different name. 



OGC 11-135r2 
 

14 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium.  
 

10.3 Semantics 

The semantics of a Parameterized CRS URI is given by the response obtained from the server 
receiving and resolving the URI. If a CRS URI references a Parameterized CRS definition (i.e., a 
GML document whose root is of type crsnts:ParameterizedCRS) then the resolver response is 
obtained from the Parameterized CRS definition by substituting all formal parameters by their values. 
These values can be provided either in the CRS URI or can be satisfied via default values in the 
Parameterized CRS definition itself. 

 If, after this substitution, some unsatisfied parameters remain then the response is of type 
crsnts:ParameterizedCRS and contains only those reference crsnts:Parameters 
which remain unsatisfied. 

 If, after this substitution, no unsatisfied parameters remain then the response is in the 
substitution group of gml:AbstractCRS. 

Requirement 20 req/representation-parameterized-incomplete: 
The resource pertaining to a CRS URI which identifies a CRS whose root is in the substitution group 
of  crsnts:ParameterizedCRS and where not all formal parameters of this Parameterized CRS 
definition are provided (either in the CRS URI or satisfied via default values in the Parameterized 
CRS definition) shall be the crsnts:ParameterizedCRS with all parameters provided are 
removed from the crsnts:parameters list and their values properly substituted in the 
crsnts:targetReferenceSystem. 

Requirement 21 req/representation-parameterized-complete: 
The resource pertaining to a CRS URI which identifies a CRS whose root is in the substitution group 
of  crsnts:ParameterizedCRS and where all formal parameters of this Parameterized CRS 
definition are provided (either in the CRS URI or satisfied via default values in the Parameterized 
CRS definition) 
shall be the gml:AbstractCRS definition referenced in the crsnts:targetReferenceSys-
tem of the CRS identified, with all parameters properly substituted. 

Example The following is a sample Parameterized CRS definition expressed in GML: 

<ParameterizedCRS

Annex A 
(non-normative) 

 
OGC CRS Name Resolver 

This Annex describes the OGC CRS Name Resolver for CRS URIs as defined in this specification. 
The OGC CRS Name Resolver delivers definitions identified by CRS and Axis URIs, provides Para-
meterized CRS definitions, and builds CRS specifications through composition and concatenation. 

A.1 Implementation and availability 

The concepts established in this document describe the OGC CRS resolver. This CRS Name 
Resolver, SECORE (Semantic Cordinate Reference System Resolver),is implemented in Java using 
the BaseX embedded XML database system (www.basex.org). The source code of SECORE is 
provided and maintained by Jacobs University and rasdaman GmbH as open-source Java code 
published under GNU LGPL as part of the rasdaman software. In the rasdaman source tree available 
from www.rasdaman.org it can be found in subdirectory applications/secore/. 

A.2 Service elements 

The OGC CRS Name Resolver accepts Axis and CRS Identifiers as input URLs. Further, it accepts 
general XQuery requests on its CRS database. 

A.3 Service URI 

The OGC CRS Name Resolver is accessible at the following service endpoint: 

 http://www.opengis.net/def/axis  for Axis Identifier URLs 

 http://www.opengis.net/def/crs  for CRS Identifier URLs and Parameterized CRS URLs 

 http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-compound for Compound CRS URLs 

 http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-equals for semantic CRS URL comparison, see A.8 

 http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-query for general XQuery requests, see A.9 

A.4 Service syntax 

The OGC CRS Name Resolver accepts queries in the syntax defined in this Name Type Specification. 

A.5 URI Resolution  

Resolution of a CRS URI results in either an Axis definition, a CRS definition, a Parameterized CRS 
definition, a CRS set, or an exception. 



OGC 11-135r2 
 

18 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium.  
 

Parameters in the URI query must all match; non-matching parameters will raise an exception. 

A.6 Parameterized CRS definitions 

A.6.1 Overview 

CRS definitions can be parameterized with one or more named parameters which are declared 
explicitly in the corresponding definition. As such, they describe (possibly infinite) sets of concrete 
CRSs.  

Note This term “parameterized” should not be mixed up with the term “parametric” in OGC Abstract Topic 2 / 
ISO 19111-2 [10] which has a significantly different meaning. 

Parameters can be resolved through values provided in the CRS URI, or through defaults defined in 
the CRS definition. Additionally, expressions (“formulae”) can be associated with a Parameterized 
CRS which evaluate to values when instantiated with parameter values. All values, whether 
instantiated in a URL request or coming from a default or a formula, can be substituted in one or 
several places in the concrete CRS definition associated with the Parameterized CRS. 

Example The following URI defines the Auto Orthographic CRS 42003 specified in Subclauses 6.7.3.4 and B.9 of 
WMS 1.3 [4] for “meter” as unit of measure and centered at 100° West longitude and 45° North latitude: 
  http://www.opengis.net/def/crs?authority=OGC&version=1.3&code=AUTO42003& 
  UoM=m&CenterLongitude=-100&CenterLatitude=45 

Note Additional examples of not-completely-specified objects are specified in Subclauses B.7, B.8, B.10, and 
B.11 of WMS 1.3 [4], and in Subclauses 10.1 through 10.3 of [OGC 05-096r1] . 

A.6.2  Structure 

Formally, a Parameterized CRS is a GML document with root crsnts:ParameterizedCRS. It 
contains an element crsnts: targetReferenceSystem referring to some instantiatable 
subtype of gml:AbstractCRS, together with a list of formal parameters. 

Parameters are crsnts:Parameter elements listed in the crsnts:Parameters section. A 
formal parameter consists of  

 a name which is locally unique within the Parameters element,  

 an optional crsnts:value element  holding a default value consisting of either a constant 
or a formula (see below for its syntax), and  

 an optional crsnts:target containing an XPath expression indicating one or more 
substitution points relative to the targetReferenceSystem subnode.  

When the crsnts:value element contains a well-formed formula then this formula shall adhere to 
the JSR scripting syntax as specified in JSR-233 [5]. The formula shall contain only references to 
parameter names defined in the same Parameterized CRS. No (direct or indirect) recursive references 
across formulae are allowed. Variable names referenced are enclosed in ${ and }. 



OGC  11-135r2 
 

19 Copyright © 2013 Open Geospatial Consortium. 
 

Note In particular, a formula cannot have its own parameter name as a free parameter. 

The target expression in crsnts:target indicates the places where, during request evaluation, the 
resulting parameter (obtained from URL input, or formula evaluation, or by using the default) gets 
applied to the CRS definition, assuming crsnts:targetReferenceSystem as the relative 
document root for XPath evaluation.  The XPath item indicates one or a set of substitution points 
relative to the CRS subnode. 

Example The following XML snippet defines a geodetic Parameterized CRS with formal parameter x substitut-
ing parameter values in all (fictitious) axisName elements appearing the gml:GeodeticCRS 
root of the CRS definition: 

<crsnts:ParameterizedCRS> 
  <gml:identifier> 
  </gml:identifier> 
  <gml:scope>…</gml:scope> 
  <crsnts:parameters> 
    <crsnts:parameter name=”lon” > 
      <crsnts:value>90</crsnts:value> 
      <crsnts:target>//longitude | //Longitude</crsnts:target> 
    </crsnts:parameter> 
    <crsnts:parameter name="zone"> 
      <crsnts:target>//greenwichLongitude</crsnts:target> 
      <crsnts:value> 
        min(floor((${lon} + 180.0) / 6.0) + 1,60) 
      </crsnts:value> 
    </crsnts:parameter> 
  </crsnts:parameters>   
  <crsnts:targetReferenceSystem 
   xlink:href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326"/> 
</crsnts:ParameterizedCRS> 

A.6.3  Resolution 

The result of a URI request against a Parameterized CRS depends on the degree of parameter 
matching, it is a GML document with its root being an instantiatable subtype of either 
gml:AbstractCRS or crsnts:ParameterizedCRS. The response is: 

 In case all formal parameters in the Parameterized CRS addressed are resolved the result is a 
gml:AbstractCRS. 

Example Assuming that the name of the above Parameterized CRS example is my-own-crs, a possible 
instantiation of this Parameterized CRS to a concrete CRS Identifier is  
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/my-own-crs?lon=47.6  

The response to this instantiation is 

<gml:GeodeticCRS> 
  …  
<gml:GeodeticCRS> 

 In case not all parameters are resolved, the resolved parameters are removed, and the non-
matched parameters remain in the template. The result is a crsnts:ParameterizedCRS. 



OGC 11-135r2

Example Assuming the same example as above, the Parameterized CRS itself can be obtained through  
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/my-own-crs  

The response to this request is 

<crsnts:ParameterizedCRS> 
  <gml:identifier> 
  </gml:identifier> 
  <gml:scope>…</gml:scope> 
  <crsnts:parameters> 
    … 
  </crsnts:parameters> 
  <crsnts:targetReferenceSystem xlink:href=”…”/> 
</crsnts:ParameterizedCRS> 

The corresponding XML Schema is available from http://schemas.opengis.net/crs-nts. 

A.7 Flattening of CRS definitions 

As opposed to classic CRSs, the concepts introduced here allow nested and parameterized definitions 
of CRSs. When resolving a CRS URI, tools and human users sometimes may want to obtain the high-
level definition indicating how a CRS is composed form other CRSs, and sometimes may want to get 
an expanded view with all references to other CRSs resolved. An optional parameter in URIs allows 
obtaining CRS definitions at selectable degrees of resolution. 

A CRS URI can be appended with an optional query parameter, expand, which allows to control how 
far xlinks in the document returned are resolved. This parameter can have the following values: 

 none: do not follow and resolve any xlink element in the CRS definition addressed. 

 all: resolve all xlink elements in the CRS definition addressed. This is the default. 

 n where n is an integer number greater than zero: resolve xlinks up to n nesting levels. 

Example 1 ...&expand=none   – during resolution, do not resolve any xlinks. 

Example 2 ...&expand=all   – during resolution, resolve all xlinks. 

Example 3 ...&expand=2   – during resolution, follow up to two xlinks in sequence. 

A.8 CRS equality 

It is possible that one and the same CRS, axis, etc. is identified by a number of syntactically different 
URLs, and it is not straightforward for applications to decide about equivalence of two given URIs. 
To remedy this, a comparison predicate is available in the resolver. A request containing two URLs 
listed as GET/KVP parameters with names 1 and 2, respectively, will result in a response of true if 
and only if both URLs resolve to definitions equivalent on the semantic level of XML, and false 
otherwise; the response is embedded in an XML document.

Example Comparing EPSG codes 4327 and 4326 can be done with this URL: 
 http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-equals?  
      1=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4327 
     &2=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326 

 The response will look like this: 

<crsnts:comparisonResult 
  xmlns='http://www.opengis.net/crs-nts/1.0'> 
  <crsnts:equal>false</crsnts:equal> 
  <crsnts:reason> 
    <![CDATA[ ...description text... ]]> 
  </crsnts:reason> 
</crsnts:comparisonResult> 

Note that the text provided in crsnts:reason is not standardized, but implementation dependent. 

A.9 XQuery 

An XQuery GET or POST request sent to URL http://www.opengis.net/def/crs-query will result in a 
document obtained from evaluating the XQuery request according to the XQuery standard [6].
