i. Abstract  

In this OGC Best Practice, the concept of semantic annotations is introduced. Annotation of 

Web Services or data compliant to OGC standards refers to the task of attaching meaningful 

descriptions to the service and the served geospatial data or processes. 

ii.  Keywords  

ogcdoc, semantic, annotations, metadata  

iii. Preface  

Annotation of Web Services or data compliant to OGC standards refers to the task of attaching 

meaningful descriptions to the service and the served geospatial data or processes. This Best 

Practice extends the expressiveness of such annotations by includin g more sophisticated 

(semantic) descriptions. Semantic annotations can be applied on different levels (metadata, data 

model, and instance data). This Best Practice investigates implications on typical applications on 

all three levels, and discusses how they can be technically realized.  

The first section introduces semantic annotations, mentions the three levels, and elaborates on 

semantic problems, which are evident in contemporary spatial data infrastructures. Such semantic 

conflicts are resolved if the proposed semantic annotations are incorporated by query processing 

routines in information retrieval (IR) systems like OGC Catalogs. This BP also discusses typical 

applications where semantic annotations can facilitate the use of OGC Web Services.  

The second section provides a detailed discussion of the three different levels and relates them 

to standardization efforts of ISO/TC211. Implications on the find-ability of geospatial resources 

and their evaluation due to the additional reasoner support are discussed for each level. Potential 

benefits as well as the drawbacks are included. The technical realization of the different 

approaches are discussed and compared as well.  

In the next section we discuss the implications for existing GIS standards like GML an d KML,  

which are  mostly from the OGC community. But also  other standards like ISO 19115 and 19119 

are included. Examples how to realize the semantic annotations for the different standards are  

listed.  

This Best Practice concludes with a comparison of each approach, and with some suggestions 

when to use which method.

Semantic annotations in OGC standards 

1. Introducing annotation 

The World Wide Web is a vast collection of arbitrary resources, held together by standards that 

tell us how to locate and transport data. Such reso urces might be textual information on a Web 

site but also can be images, a video, do wnload-able multi spectral satellite image, OGC Web 

Feature Service providin g some vector data, or a Sensor Observation Service delivering up -to-

date temperature values. Without proper descriptions, the use of such a reso urce is limited to a 

small user  gro up. Before publishing a reso urce in the Web, it  has to be annotated with 

descriptive metadata to make it  usable to a broad audience. Otherwise people will  neither be able  

to find the resource using search engines nor will they be able to evaluate if the discovered 

resource satisfies their current information need. 

The OGC standards baseline provides accepted and well thought -out methods to make spatial 

resources (data and processes) served via Web Services accessible. Service capabilities (see 

figure 1 as example) describe, besides contextual information like contact information, how to 

access an d invoke the service to retrieve the required geo spatial data. The individual name an d 

location of the operations are also listed in the Capabilities document of each OGC-conformal 

Web Service (as defined in OGC W S-Common). Since such operations and the format to encode 

the data are predefined in OGC Implementation Standards and OGC Encoding Standards, generic 

clients can, without knowledge abo ut the nature of the data, display the resulting data on a map. 

In this OGC Best Practice, we introduce the notion of semantic annotation. With the help of 

the OGC Capabilities-Document and the various individual descriptions of feature types, 

coverages, or processes, the standards of the OGC define how to access, invoke, and finally  

visualize spatial data. The OGC standards cover the functional dimension of a Web Services. But 

they lack a well-defined methodology to describe the thematic dimension of a Web Service. They 

don’t tell much about what the served data (or process) represents, and in particular they lack a 

way to link the resources to external models. For example, the application knows ho w to load and 

visualize the data on a map, but the user has no idea how to read the displayed map. With the h elp 

of semantic annotations, data providers will  be able to connect the standardized service 

descriptions to the modeled knowledge.  Such models comprise  conceptualized knowledge abo ut 

the represented geographic phenomena. Having such a link established, reasoning algorithms will 

be able  to infer if a Web Service matches an agent 's query on the formal level. In addition it  will  

allow for extracting valuable contextual information from the knowledge models, making it  

possible to display thematic information for the displayed data and helping the user to understand.  

The in depth discussion of applications for semantic annotations in the context of OGC 

Standards can be considered to be the main contribution of this Best Practice. The concept of 

three different levels where annotations can be applied has been  developed for this Best Practice 

paper. Additionally, this is the first t ime we discuss the semantics of the reference, and justify the 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 12 

distinction between model references an d domain references. T his Best Practice paper does not 

suggest introducing new standards.  We rather propose to extend the notion of already existing 

OGC standards an d to apply standards from other organizations like the W3C to OGC Standards.  

In the remainder of this section we are going to discuss which different levels for annotating 

OWS descriptions exist, why Semantics are needed in the annotation process, and what types of 

applications and scenarios can benefit from includin g knowledge model references in the 

annotation process. We use semantic discovery as main motivation, but include pointers to 

additional usage scenarios.  

Figure 1 shows the metadata available for a WFS serving one feature type with the name 

exploitationsponctualsproduction. The example will be used throughout this Best 

Practice paper to illustrate why semantic annotations are needed, an d ho w they should be 

realized. This example, an d accordingly the service providin g the associated data
1
, has been  

developed within the European funded project SWING2. The methods have been also studied 

durin g research for the German funded project GDI Grid 3.

Figure 2 - The data model for the WFS  of Fig ure 1.  

 

Figure 2 lists the GML schema for the exploitationsponctualsproduction feature type. 

But what does its data represent? The name is already confusing; the attributes don't  give us any  

additional information. Whose name is the value of name, what does the at tribute year refer to, 

and how is the allowedproduction measured?  

1.1  Why semantic annotations 

Before going into the technical details about semantic annotations, we need to discuss some 

theoretical background of semantics, in particular how semantics can increase the usefulness of  

geospatial information. We introduce the different types of semantic conflicts and the notion of 

semantic interoperability, the idea of conceptualization to resolve these conflicts, and the use of 

formal languages to specify such conceptualizations.  

The major goals of standards like XML or GML is to achieve syntactic and structural 

interoperability between different software components
4
. If two agents agree on ho w to represent

and communicate the data, a seamless and conflict -free integration is established. Hence,  

semantic interoperability can be achieved if the two agents (both, humans and machines) agree on  

how to understand the data. The level of understanding can differ and depends mostly on the 

complexity of the formalized knowledge. The followin g listing discusses common conflicts (or 

heterogeneities) which can be addressed using conceptualizations on the domain level and the 

semantic annotations to relate OWS to these domain concepts.  

Application-specific knowledge: The feature type modeled in figure 2 sho ws an example for 

problems that are caused by application-specific knowledge. Fir st, certain identifiers or terms 

are used in a small community, which makes the underlying data hardly usable for other 

user s. The casual user does obvio usly not know what an 

exploitationsponctualproduction represents, and he would fail to discover the data 

even if would provide the required search terms. The attribute allowedproduction 

remains unclear to the user as well. It  refers to the maximum  allowed production of the 

product (gravel, chalk, …) in tons per year. The attribute year is in this case the year this 

allowed production is meant for. Without a further description which is shared to the other 

parties, the use of this data is constrained to a very limited user group. Having elaborated 

semantic descriptions linked to these attributes and feature types provides a solution to this 

problem.  

Hierarchical Problems: Probably the most common issue in service discovery is the 

different level of expertise between the seeking user and the data provider. A casual user  

looking for excavations is obviously taking the term “excavation ” or “mine”. The specialist 

publishing the data is usin g more specific terms, like “quarry” (an open -pit mine) or 

“chalkpit” (a quarry use to excavate chalk). Searching based only on keywords would yield 

no results here. Since one term is more specific then another (we refer to it  as a hypernym 5), 

they can be simply associated on the conceptual level using taxonomic relatio nships. The 

domain concept QUARRY is then simply modeled as sub-concept of the domain concept 

EXCA VATION.  

Multilingual community: Yet often neglected in the Anglo-centric GIS community, the 

different languages spoken by users impair the find-ability of spatial resources as well.  

Especially in the European region the requirement for multilingual descriptions of geo spatial 

data gains importance. Concepts at the domain level support labels in different languages,  

which makes it  possible to match a user's query and service description even if the chosen 

languages differ. This approach assumes that terms in different languages can be refer red to 

exactly the same concept. But the German term “Steinbruch” does not necessarily bear the 

same meaning as the American English term “Quarry” or the British English term “stone pit”. 

Depending on the required complexity of the knowledge, lan guage- specific concepts might 

need to be introduced as well.  

Typical semantic problems result from the ambiguity of human language. Individual language 

depends greatly on the backgroun d kno wledge, which is influenced by society, culture,

profession, and much more. If data should not be restricted to a user community speaking, by  

chance, the same language as the data provider, we need to solve the following semantic 

heterogeneities: 

Synonymy: One term is a synonym of another different word, if they both denote the same 

object. A synonym for the word “quarry” is, for example, the “open -pit mine”. On the 

conceptual level, we wo uld identify the concepts QUARRY an d OPENPITMINE, as similar. A 

reasoning algorithm is then able to infer that a user searching for “quarry” is, in the same 

moment, also looking for a “open pit mine”. The user doesn't  even have to realize that the 

query has be redefined, since all additional results are as relevant as the others.  

Homonymy: Typical representatives of semantic heterogeneities are also homonyms. One 

word has multiple meanings, and only the context makes it  understandable to the reader. 

“Mine”, for example, is defined either as excavation in the earth
6
 or as explosive device that 

explodes on contact. It can in both cases also be used as verb. On the conceptual level such  

terms are only used to label a concept. It  is therefore quite simple to distinguish  bet ween  

homonyms. The words look equal, but they are linked to different concepts.  

Polysemy: Typical semantic problems in geospatial applications are result of the ambiguity 

of place names (also called toponyms). Like homonyms, a polysem is described as a word 

which can be under stood differently depending on contextual information. But in this case 

the denoted objects (and therefore also  the concepts on the domain level) are similar. A 

toponym is very often also a polysem. Examples are “do wntown”, “Main Street”, or even 

names of cities like “ Springfield” 7. Since something like “do wntown” stays conceptually the 

same, even if it  there is a large spatial distance in space, it  cannot  be fully covered by formal 

domain concepts on the domain level. Annotations of the individual data entities, on the 

other hand, might help.  

1.2  Different perspectives on annotations 

Semantic annotations establish a  connection between the geospatial resource,  its metadata, and 

the ontology. The following figure 3 illustrates the three different levels of (semantic) annotations 

which are possible for OGC Web Services, taking the WFS from Figure1 as example.

Figure 3 - Semantic annotations at three different levels  

It  is possible to distinguish between three locations where particular information about the 

resource can be acquired. The Capabilities-document defined in OW S-Common comprises 

functional properties telling the user how to access and invoke the service, as well as some 

resource  metadata with information about the service provider, licensing, a  title and description, 

or a keyword section (Figure 1). An additional document provided by every OW S is a XML-

based schema representing the data model (figure 2), which comprises a description of the data 

model with focus on syntax and structure. Both documents, the metadata and the schema, are 

describin g the un derlying data, and therefore explicitly linked (highlighted by the orange arro w).  

The third source of information are obviously the data entities itself, encoded in the format 

predefined in the data model specified in the data schema.  

A reference (the numbered arro ws in  the figure) to a knowledge model is feasible  on all three 

levels. In figure 3, a WFS which serves quarry features (with allowedproduction  as one 

attribute) is semantically annotated. We can directly link (1) a keyword within the Capabilities-

Document to the corresponding concept in the domain ontology. We can annotate (2) the data 

model (the features and the attributes) usin g an application -specific ontology. Or we attach (3) 

semantic annotations directly to the feature instances. Each type of annotation has different 

implications on the find-ability of the Web Service, and the possibility of the user to evaluate if 

the served data satisfies his needs.  The different levels with benefits and drawbacks are discussed 

in detail later on. 

1.3  Semantics of the Reference 

The link between elements in a XML document and concepts from a shared vocabulary encoded 

in another format is coined the model reference (introduced in the W3C Standards SAW SDL). Its 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 17 

purpose is to bridge different languages,  and is alway s a  link between t wo models (e.g. XML 

Schema or UML modeling data, RDF modeling a domain vocabulary, and so on).  

The domain reference, on the other hand, links between  a local,  application -specific model 

and a glo bal, shared vocabulary. Whereas the model reference is a unique URI which points to 

the corresponding element in another model, the domain reference can be also expressed in form  

of complex rules. Here, n-ary links are required to accommodate for the complex relationship 

between application-specific features and common domain knowledge.  

The following figure sho ws how these references relate. Note that the two types of references 

can overlap. In many cases a domain reference is in the same time also a model reference, since 

the reference performs both tasks (bridgin g in bet ween two languages an d linking from local to 

global). In this case, the domain reference should be used.  

 

 

Figure 4 - Two types of references  

The figure above represents a level 2 annotation: a data model (the feature type schema) is linked 

to the resource ontology via the model reference link, which again  is linked to the domain 

ontology with the domain reference. If the features itself are to be anno tated (e.g. placemarks in a  

KML file), we should use the domain reference if we link directly to a shared vocabulary, such as 

a gazetteer.  

The distinction between two reference types (and the introduction of the resource ontology) 

adds an additional layer of complexity, but has also several benefits which in  our opinion are  

crucial for the applications introduced later. Using only domain refe rences (linking directly to 

domain vocabularies) for level 1 and level 2 annotations results in either too application -specific 

domain models or too generic annotations. Take for example the attribute name from the feature 

type example in Figure 2. Either it  is linked to the concept IDENTIFIER, which means we lose the 

information what entity is identified with its value. Or we link it  to the concept QUARRYNAME, 

which means we have to update the domain vocabulary for data models with complex 

relationships; the latter results in cluttered vocabularies barely usable for tasks like semantic 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 18 

integration. With a resource ontology, we can model the implicit  relationships between the 

different data feature attributes and the feature itself. On a local level we model  that the name is 

the name of the quarry, or that the value of the year refers to the year where the value of the  

allowed production rate is valid. 

1.4  Ontologies as Formalized Knowledge  

Up to now we always referred to conceptualizations on the domain level, and avoided the term 

ontology. Analogue to Gruber's definition (Gruber, 1995) for ontologies, we see an ontology as 

particular specification of a conceptualization. They are not necessarily needed to solve every 

potential semantic problem listed in Section. Different levels of hierarchies are, for example, also 

resolved usin g thesauri like GEMET 8 from the European Environmental Agency (EEA) or 

AGROVOC from FAO 9, which serve synonyms and hypernyms for a defined collection of terms. 

But the proposed solution should cover all introduced challenges resulting from semantic 

heterogeneities. Dictionaries, controlled vocabularies and even taxonomies can be considered as 

less formal, less expressive, and therefore less powerful conceptualiza tions of domain knowledge.  

Ontologies and the underlying formal systems have the required expressiveness to formalize the 

conceptualizations and rules required to avoid the listed semantic conflicts. Note though, that the 

mentioned domain-specific thesauri represent the vocabulary commonly accepted within the 

information community. Engineering domain ontologies representing a  certain domain’s 

vocabulary should therefore always take common and well-accepted thesauri as starting point. Or, 

even better, the authorities controlling the thesauri also create the ontologies (in the case of  

AGROVOC). 

The Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) 10, which is built  on top of OMG's Model Driven 

Architecture (MDA),  identifies four main components used to specify (and formalize) a 

conceptualization: relations, individuals, axioms, an d the concepts used to define the vocabulary.  

This is a rather light -weight view on ontologies, but nonetheless allo ws for explaining the main 

difference to a less flexible knowledge base like a  thesaurus. The ontology's axioms can be used 

to constrain the relationship between concepts, or to create new knowledge in the form of rules.  

Having these complex concept definitions (concept, its relations, the axioms constraining the 

relations, and the individuals of this concept) expressed in a language based on a formal 

deductive system like first -order logic  or description logic enables the use of reasoning 

algorithms. Inference can be as simple as creating new facts from transitive relations, but also as  

complex as matching complex logical statements usin g techniques like Query Containment 

(Calvanese, 1998). It depends on the required expressiveness which kind of logic language is 

selected. But the more expressive the underlying language, the less decidab le are the expressed 

statements. A reasoning algorithm which has to compute a potential match between services 

described usin g ontologies based on first -order logic requires more resources (in terms of time

and computing po wer) compared to ontologies used in a less expressive description logic  

(Baader, 2003).  

In this Best Practice we discuss semantic annotations of existing OGC standards. We try to 

focus on the extensions in the existing service description documents, but nonetheless we have to 

introduce the standards used to express the conceptualization on the domain level. A wide variety 

of different languages and supporting tools is available, rangin g from the very simple Topic Maps 

(ISO/IEC 13250) to complex descriptions in logic programming lan guages like Prolog (ISO/IEC 

13211). We focus on three examples which  are commonly used today and which have gained 

tremendous support in the rise of the Semantic Web. 

The most common language is the RDF-based Web Ontology Language (O WL), which has 

reached the status of a W3C Recommendation. The most frequently OWL variant (OWL-DL) is 

based on Description Logic (DL), which constrains its expressiveness an d therefore applicability. 

But the decidability, good support, and wide availability of tools makes it  the first  choice for the 

majority of applications. OWL211 introduced the possibility to create profiles, with different 

supported reasoning capabilities in mind. OWL can be bundled with even more expressive rule  

languages like the Semantic Web Rule Language (SW RL). Rules can lead to un decidable  

statements in the ontologies, but still contribute significantly to the expressiveness of OWL.

 The Web Service Modeling O ntology (WSMO ) was developed to account for the 

requirements of finding and composin g Web Services. The used language, the Web Service 

Modelin g Language (W SML), comes in different flavours. Like OWL-DL, WSML-DL is 

constrained to the language constructs allowed for a Description Logic. But with WSML -Flight 

and WSML-Rule, two flexible lan guages are available which allow for expressing even more 

sophisticated conceptualization. A thorough introduction in WSML is available in the W3C 

submission. 

The Simple Knowledge O rganization System (SKOS)  is a formal language designed for 

representation of thesauri, classification schemes, taxonomies or any other type of structured 

controlled vocabulary. SKOS is built  upon RDF and RDFS, is simpler than OWL, and focuses on  

the easy publication of controlled structured vocabularies. Because it  is based on RDF, SKOS 

entities can be integrated in OWL constructs. It  must be noted that SKOS concepts are not OWL 

classes (they are instances thereof) and therefore cannot be used as instantiable classes, nor have 

class properties. SKOS has reached the status of W3C Recommendation. 

The following two figures 4 and 5 show how the application ontology from figure 3 on page 

12 would be encoded in OWL and W SML. (The SKOS example is detailed later) Sentences in 

OWL are represented as triples, because it  has been modeled as extension to RDF and RD F(S).  

The WSML code has a RDF representation as well, but can also be serialized (and later again  

parsed) using an  human-readable form like in figure 5. In the W SML example cardinalities have 

been added to the attributes. In this case the attribute msGeometry is mandatory, because it  has a  

cardinality of exactly 1. All other attributes can be either present or not.

An ontology architecture provides an high-level view on the various types of ontologies, and ho w 

they are related to each other. There are two types of distinctions which will be used through -out 

this Best Practice.  

Local vs. global: Local ontologies are used in a particular application, and are not shared or 

publicly available. Global ontologies, on the other hand, are available to everyone, and should 

therefor not contain individual kno wledge. Concepts in local ontologies have to be linked to 

global concepts to make them useful, for example, to let the reasoner decide if t wo local concepts 

are denoting the same thing.  

Application, Domain, and Foundational Ontologies:  Local ontologies as mentioned above 

are usually coined application ontologies, in the fo llowin g we prefer to use Resource Ontology. 

Such ontology comprises concepts used for a specific application, in our context the application is 

the provision and use of geospatial resources in the WWW. A Resource Ontology might include,  

for example, concepts representing feature types and their attributes (see Figure 1) which are  

defined in the feature type schema of a Web Feature Service. Domain  Ontologies are shared an d 

global conceptualizations which are used across different applications. A Foundational  Ontology

(also called Upper Level, Top Level, or Formal Ontology) sits on top of domain ontologies, and 

allows for bridging bet ween the different domains.  This level of ontologies is not yet fully 

specified, an d requires more research before being useful for applications.  

 

 

Figure 8 - O ntology  Architecture  

The strict distinction between domain ontologies which try to capture the common knowledge of  

one community, and the application-specific Resource Ontology which model s the very specific 

inner workings of a particular dataset or process is fundamental for the understanding of semantic 

annotations. Information exchange requires commitment of all parties to the global kno wledge 

modeled in the domain ontology. On the local level each participant can model the application 

ontologies in a way which best suits his purpose. Forcing him to use domain concepts only will  

result in loosing valuable application specific knowledge. Relating the local application 

ontologies to global ontologies allo ws for keeping this local knowledge as well making the served 

data findable for reasoner-supported IR systems. Such systems are no w able  to infer that services 

like the two illustrated in figure 6 do actually match because they serve related data and can be 

both of interest for a discovery task using, for example, the concept QUARRY.  

A slightly more complex reasoning scenario involves subsumption reasoning. The local 

concept EXPLOITATION is related to the domain concept QUARRY, the other local concept 

GRAVEL_EXCAV is associated with the domain concept INDUSTRY. Since Quarry is modeled as 

being a sub-concept of INDUSTRY, the reasoning engine is able to infer the both local concepts are 

related (they are not similar, though). 

 

  

1.5  Applications  

We claim that semantic annotations can increase the usefulness of OGC Web Services in nearly 

many scenarios they can be deployed in. Four typical applications are discussed in detail belo w.  



OGC 08-167r2

They are subject of interest for two research projects the authors are involved with.  In the 

German GDI-Grid project  we studied way s how to semantically validate GRID-enabled 

workflo w. And in the European funded SWING project the applicability of Semantic Web 

Technologies in the context of geospatial decision making in th e mining industry has been 

discussed.  

1.5.1  Geographic Information discovery and retrieval  

Due to the complex nature of Geographic Information, the discovery of such data is significantly 

more challenging then searching, for example, a Web site using a keyword-based search engine.  

Spatial data comprise several search-able dimensions: Space, T ime, and Theme. OGC Standards 

like Filter Encoding have addressed the spatial dimension sufficiently, and even temporal 

characteristics of spatial data can be simply queried usin g a well-defined temporal reference 

system like the Calendar. The thematic dimension on the other hand is restricted to string-based 

filters, which neglects the semantic problem s introduced in section  1.1  and makes the discovery 

of geographic resources representing a specific phenomena a tedious task.  

We argue that GIR using semantic-enabled catalogs can improve user experience and 

usefulness of such IR systems significantly. Letting users specify not only keywords, but relating 

their queries to conceptualized domain knowledge using the proposed annotation approach will 

enable reasonin g algorithms (a) to expand the user queries, (b) to increase  the number of relevant 

records in the repository, and (c) to return a more precise result set in the end. Hence, semantic 

descriptions can be used to increase recall, i.e. discovering all services which fit  the user  

requirements, and precision, i.e. includin g only relevant service in the result set. 

Discovery of semantically annotated processing components with focus on operations is 

complex, and requires more sophisticated reasoning capabilities. Here, various kinds of matches 

have to be applied. The classical approach, the exact match, has to be separated from the 

predicate match, plug-in match, and an extended plug-in match (Zaremski 1996, Lutz 2006).   

Predicated matches compare requested process descriptions with the pre- and post-conditions 

of the advertised services in one matchmaking step. Predicate matches are especially useful for  

simple queries such as "give me all services that compute overlay". The predicate match fails if a  

requested precondition  is more specific/restrictive then the precondition offered by some Web 

Service, although the Web Service could execute on the input provided by the requester. Hence, 

these matches may decrease recall, that is: some WPSs that provide the requested functionality 

are possibly not retrieved. If the provided precondition is more specific then the requested one,  

predicate match succeeds although an acceptable input cannot be guaranteed. Hence, this match 

possibly decreases precision, that is: some WPSs that are retrieved are possibly not able to fulfill  

the requested functionality. 

The more sophisticated Plug-In Match compares the pre-conditions and post -conditions 

separately. This avoids the drawback s from the predicate matches. It  is still impossible to 

consider dependencies bet ween inputs and outputs using t his type of match. Having two polygons 

(A and B) as inputs, it  is impossible to identify if it  is difference (A – B) or (B - A). This type of 

match is not aware of possible permutations of the input variables. Since this can possibly deliver  

wrong results, it  may decrease precision as well.  



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 24 

For a non-relaxed match, i.e. a match with high precision and high recall, the Extended Plug-

In Match was developed. This algorithm is able to incorporate all the elements of a process 

description. But due to its complexity and the dependency on expressive ontology languages, it  is 

very resource intensive and not (yet) applicable for large-scale applications. SWING D3.2  

(Schade et al, 2006) contains more information on possible implementations using W SML -Flight, 

an ontology language variant based on logic programming.  

1.5.2  Geographic Information validation 

Once Geographic Information has been discovered, the agent (user or machine) has to evaluate if  

the available spatial dataset matches the user requirements. Several aspects play an important role 

here, and not many have been investigated sufficiently (like Service Level Agreements, Quality 

of Service parameters, License issues, Security, ..).  The use of ontologies to describe specific  

aspects of a Web Service, or the served data, is a flexible and easily extensible approach. 

Technologies like RDF which are used to encode ontologies account for the dynamics of the 

modeled kno wledge. They can easily be extended with additional (non-ontological) information 

without the need alter the underlying schemata. The flexibility of reasoning algorithms doesn't  

restrict metadata to specific content, they only reason on the relevant ontological subset of the 

document.  

The evaluation of the thematic dimension of the spatial data is obviously improved as well.  

Since we are not restricted to ambiguo us, error-prone and usually missing key words and textual 

descriptions any more, it  is now easier to evaluate what the discovered service represents. 

Formalized concepts on the domain level are sophisticated descriptions, including label in  

different languages, relationships to other concepts, and many more. Since these concepts are 

encoded in ontologies, the extent of potential information about them is not constrained.  

1.5.3  Validation of Service Workflows 

If we consider Web Services as atomic components, which either serve or process geospatial data, 

we also want to be able to compose more complex services by creating service workflows. Data 

services like the WFS or WCS deliver geospatial data, which is then processed an d modified by a  

WPS. The output of the WPS could be again a Feature Collection, Coverage, or an image.  

Depending on the resulting data, the whole service composition will be encapsulated again as 

WPS, WFS, WCS, or WMS.  

Creating the workflows is a matter of adding existing Web Services to the present composition 

and, at the end, hand over the workflow document to a workflow engine. Since only OW S are 

used, syntactic interoperability of the service components can be assumed. GML is output of the 

data services, and GML is the expected input of the processing services. Semantic 

interoperability, on the other hand, can only be achieved if the used Web Services are  

semantically annotated. Reasoners can match the outputs with the input of the subsequent service, 

and are therefore able to validate if the workflo w not only syntactically, but also semantically  

valid.  

1.5.4  Semantically supported integration of geospatial data sets 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 25 

Integrating spatial datasets in any form assumes that both datasets match in geometry, structure 

and semantics. Geometry simply refers to the spatial nature of the represented data; both datasets 

are representing the data in the same way, for example in form of points in the case of feature 

types representing our quarries. Structurally matching feature types have either equal sets of  

attributes, or routines which  are used to translate between  attributes. A syntactic al match is 

ensured if the same standard, meaning the same version of GML, is used for encoding the data.  

Such tasks don't  consider the semantic dimension yet. Two datasets may be compatible in their 

geometric, syntax and structure. But this doesn't  imply that each attribute present in both feature 

types with the same identifier has the same meaning.  The feature type of our example has the 

attribute allowedproduction, which is measured in tons per year. Another dataset my have 

the same attribute, but its value refers to the allowed weekly production. Integrating the two 

datasets wo uld clearly result in unusable data. Semantically annotated attributes and a validation 

procedure, optionally supported by rules to translate from one value to another, will eithe r warn 

the user in the case of semantically incompatible datasets, or use the rules to solve semantic 

conflicts.  

Integrating of specific spatial entities is also an interesting application for semantic 

annotations on the instance level. If two spatially close entities are equally annotated, one can 

infer that both refer to the same geographic object, which means they have to be integrated. As 

example, two point features within a distance of less than 100 meters are related to the domain 

concept QUARRY. It  is reasonable to assume that both features refer to the same geographic 

object, they can be combined to one feature.  Rules formalized in the domain knowledge can  

support such assumptions, and can be automatically applied either during the annotation of 

instances, or during the integrating of datasets.  

2. Semantic annotations at three different levels 

Modellin g knowledge an d publishing it  in a well-defined and machine interpretable format can 

result in increased usability of OGC Web Services. We consider ontologies as most promising 

format to capture such  knowledge. But the possibilities to connect onto logies with OGC services 

are manifold. In this section we discuss ho w we can annotate OGC services on the already  

mentioned three levels: 

1. the service metadata,  

2. the data models and process descriptions, and 

3. the actual data instances in the database.   

The three annotations levels differ in their potential. This is due to different reasoning 

capabilities, i.e. the abilities to infer either new knowledge (making implicit  knowledge explicit) 

or to identify conflicts in existing models. Accordingly, the applications for semantically 

supported OW S discovery and workflo w validation vary. Requirements vary between projects, 

the following comparison of the three levels with implications on reasoning and potential benefits 

can therefore only outline possibilities. 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 26 

Notably, although we illustrate semantic annotations in the OGC context, they can be similarly 

defined in relation to ISO/TC211. In particular t he ISO General Feature Model (GFM) described 

in ISO 19109 and ISO 19115 (Metadata) has to be considered. In GFM,  geo spatial data is 

modelled as features and their properties and associations. Metadata can be associated for each of 

these elements. 

Following our suggestion, a semantic annotation would either link instances of the GFM, i.e. 

concrete feature types, feature attributes and feature operation, or their instances, i.e. concrete 

feature collections and their content to concepts of an ontology. The first approach reflects level 

2, the second level 3. Level 1 annotation would relate to service metadata (ISO 19119 ). 

In any case, a semantic annotation can be seen as a specific kind of metadata and should 

therefore be considered as an official metadata element. 

 

2.1  Implications for geospatial applications 

Semantic annotations extend the already existing annotations like  the OGC Capabilities document 

by linking particular metadata elements to conceptualized domain knowledge. These links point 

to one or more concepts, which are modelled usin g ontologies or the less formal taxonomies. The 

Quarries W FS from the example in figure 1 (p.8) can, for example, be annotated with the concept 

QUARRY, MINE, and AGGREGATE. Sophisticated semantic annotations include axioms, i.e. 

combinations of logic statements, which relate various domain concepts to each other in order to 

elaborate the internal relationships of the data. The feature type 

exploitationponctualsproduction has, for example, the attributes allowedproduction  

and year. With the help of axioms we are able to specify that allowedproduction is 

measured in Tons per Year, and that this Year is related to the other attribute year. We have 

successfully investigated such complex semantic annotations in the mentioned SWING project, 

detailed explanations are available in the deliverable 3.2 from the project web site (Schade et al, 

2008). 

2.1.1  Level 1 - Service Metadata 

Adding knowledge model references in one of the existing sections in the data and/or services 

metadata (e.g. by extending the keyword section of OW S Capabilities) is the most pragmatic and 

still useful approach to semantic annot ations. In our example, only limited information is 

available in the service metadata section (see Figure 1).  The name “MapServer WFS” is 

automatically generated and bears no meaning, the title “Quarries” and the keywords “brgm,  

quarries, quarry, france” provide an only very limited description of the served geospatial data. 

Being able to semantically enrich metadata sections like the keywords makes under standing of  

the intended meaning a reality.

Figure 9 - Annotations as  par t of the resource metadata  

 

Keywords themselves might act as the model references. They can be direct links (orange 

“reference”-arrow in figure 7) to the concepts or axioms in the domain ontology. This approach 

extends the notion of keywords to serve not humans only by becoming also interpretable by  

machines. In addition to the keywords “quarry” “france” and “brgm”, we can add links to 

concepts within a shared kno wledge model (which can be as simple as a thesaurus or as complex  

as domain ontology). This model is then a conceptualization of the reality, the concept QUARRY 

denotes real quarries.  

The main benefit  of this approach is low implementation costs, since we only extend the 

notion of existing metadata sections. But changing the purpose of this section to include model 

references decreases their usefulness in terms of readability for human users. Textual descriptions 

are one major source of information for evaluating the served data. Having cryptic URIs instead 

of terms does obviously not improve acceptance by the readers. In section 3.2.2  we list examples 

how adding concept identifiers to existing metadata sections may look like. In sectio n 2.2.1   we 

introduce the idea of visualization tools to improve the readability by human users.  

Looking at the discussed applications for semantic annotations, the discovery and evaluation 

of geospatial data already benefits from this even very light -weight approach. But the 

improvements just affect tasks concerned about the service metadata level. Replacing keywords 

with model references cannot cover the complexity of the data served by an OGC Web Service,  

because no formal connection to the served data has been  established.  The reasoning only works 

on the service metadata level. As result the GIR system can only infer that a discovered service is 

in some way related to the domain concept. Unless the semantic annotations are not directly 

applied to served resources, i.e. feature types, map layers,  a searching user would not able to 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 28 

identify the resource providing the needed information. In the case of WFS, he want s to know 

which feature types serve the information associated with this domain concept. And within a 

feature type, he wants to identify which attributes bear the requested information. In the following 

section we discuss semantic annotations directly attached to the resource,   making it  therefore 

possible to overcome these problems and enablin g more sophisticated reasoning tasks.  

2.1.2  Level 2 - Data Models  

In order to relate service metadata more efficiently to domain knowledge, we need to take a 

closer look at the data models and the service operations. In this section we further discuss the 

annotation for data as it  served by a  WFS or a W CS. In the follo wing section we address 

processes an d operations, which are usually made available using the WPS standard. Considerin g 

data structures (like GML application schema) for semantic annotations enables reasoning on data  

model level. In the example of figure 8, t he feature type and the feature attributes have a 

reference to concepts in the resource ontology. Within this ontology we are no w able to relate the 

local service-specific concepts, which are directly associated to the data, to the global domain  

concepts (see Figure 6)  

 

Figure 10 -  Referencing  elements in the data model to domain ontolog ies  

 

Defining the semantics of a feature type, i.e. using an application ontology to capture the meaning 

of the elements and attributes used in the data model, enables reasoning on a more detailed level.  

Again, the specific reasoning capabilities rely on the ex pressiveness of the chosen logical 

language. Reasoner-supported IR systems for geospatial Web Services an d data sets based on the 

semantic annotation approach have been implemented successfully (see Schade et al, 2008 and 

Hoffmann et al, 2008). With semant ically and syntactically correct annotations we have sho wn  



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 29 

that discovery, in term of precision, can benefit  significantly. It depends, however, on 

sophisticated semantic queries to benefit  from the full complexity of the semantic annotations on 

this level. As explained in section 2.2.1  , we have investigated user interface which support the 

user in creating such more complex queries.  

Even if there is no exact match between a user's query and the semantically annotated Web 

Service, the annotations help to increase recall. Once discovered, the annotation can be used to 

identify the exact attributes containing t he desired information (see figure belo w). The references 

have to be follo wed the other way, from the ontology back to the data model and its specific  

elements. In the example, such links in dicate that the attribute allowedproduction  contains 

information about the allowed production of a specific substance in t ons per year, the name 

information considers the name of the owner of the quarry, etc.

2.1.3  Level 2 - Geospatial Processes  

Approaching semantic discovery of processing functionality requires more then a Resource 

Ontology describin g the output from a Web Service. As illustrated in the following figure, it  is 

not sufficient to provide a domain vocabulary includin g all  possible  processes a Web service can  

implement. It  is additionally required to model not only the output of the Web service (as we do it  

for the data models), but also the expected input dat a of the process and the dependencies 

between the output and the input (e.g. sayin g the resulting output area is the union of the two 

input areas). Taking not only the output (the postconditions), but also the input (preconditions) 

into consideration demands for more sophisticated reasoning capabilities, and is for example 

discussed in more detail in the Hoffmann et al. (2008).  



OGC 08-167r2

Figure 12 -  Elements for the Annotation of Processes. 

 

Due to the expected complexity we assume semantic annotations of processes is (for now) only 

applicable for a small n umber of applications. The semantic validation of workflows includin g 

processing functionality depends on the semantic annotation of all components.  It  is additionally 

useful for tasks where specific processin g capabilities within a large pool of WPS are searched.  

Annotating processes is a lso interesting if non-standard operations are implemented and served 

via Web Services not conformal to the OGC Standards. In the case of WFS, WCS, an d o ther 

OWS focussed on data only, the annotation can focus on the data since the semantics of the 

operations are predefined.  

2.1.4  Level 3 - Data Entities 

Semantic annotations are also  possible  on the data entity level. Regarding OGC Web Service,  

GML features and feature attributes are the entities which have to be annotated here. We can 

distinguish bet ween two potential techniques: The individual entities can be either annotated with 

domain concepts or with individuals on the domain level. A specific quarry can, for example, be a 

chalk pit. A user might want to express this information by annotating it  with the domain concept 

CHALKPIT. If this particular chalk pit is modelled in the domain ontology (in this case as 

individual of the concept CHALKPIT),  he might even want to directly associate the data entity 

with this individual.Havin g annotations on the instance level has several implications on 

discovery and evaluation of geospatial resources. The annotations can be used to search for a 

subset of features (in this case only data entities representing chalk pits) by filtering o ut other 

features. The information available for in dividual entities can be increased significantly. Since 

ontologies are, by nature, a very flexible mo del, additional information can be adde d on runtime. 

Adding additional documentation to individual data entities is therefore simply a matter of adding 

it  to the associated Concept/Individual in the Resource Ontology. One specific  application, the 

merging of datasets includin g quality control, can benefit  tremendously from semantic 

annotations on the data entity level. During merging, features annotated either with the same 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 31 

individual can be regarded as equal. In addition, rules can be applied to formalize constraints on 

the thematic dimension to reduce error in data sets. This wo uld, for example, not only ensure 

geometric consistency of datasets (a street network has to be connected), but also semantic 

consistency (features annotated with the domain concept H IGHWAY can not be directly connected 

to features representing a PEDESTRIANZONE).Technical realization of the individual levels  

2.2  Technical realization of the individual levels 

Up to now the implications on the applications have been discussed, together with drawbacks an d 

benefits for each level. In the following three sub-sections we discuss how the annotations shall 

be technically realized.  

2.2.1  Level 1 - Service Metadata 

Only sparse information is available for the Quarries WFS. The name “MapServer WFS” is 

automatically generated and refers to the implementation, the title “Quarries” as well as the 

keywords “brgm, quarries, quarry, france” provide an only very limited desc ription of the served 

geospatial data. The most light -weight and simplest implementation of a semantic annotation is to 

extend the keyword section by addin g pointers to domain concepts. Another option is to use the 

METADATA field which is proposed as Service Content Metadata in WS-Common. The standard 

does not specify what types of metadata are meant to be entered here. It  would be therefore 

possible to add the list  of domain concepts to this field as well.  

Each concept is uniquely identified by an URI, the accepted standard to encode locations in 

the World Wide Web. Using an URI as concept identifier presumes either a predefined 

knowledge base where such concepts might be retrieved from, or that the URI is a lso an URL 

which can be simply accessed using a standard Internet browser.  

In Section 2.1.1   we argued that addin g such URIs to the service metadata section have a 

negative impact on the readability. One potential solution are tools to visualize the concepts and 

their relations on the domain level as in figure 11. This tool has been developed within the 

SWING project to make the creation of semantic annotations also possible for non -experts. A tool 

bun dled with this visualization component is available for do wnload12, a video13 demonstrates its 

usage.

To benefit  from reasoning on the data model level, the data schema is associated with its  

Reso urce Ontology. In the first step, the existing data schema can be simply translated into the 

according Reso urce Ontology. In figure 13 the result of such a translation is visualized (the 

resulting W SML co de is listed in Figure 5. The association between the concepts within the 

XML-based data schema and the Resource Ontology is established by adding an additional 

attribute to the selected elements in the schema, with the identifier (as URI) of the concept as 

value.  GIR systems like a CAT can now retrieve, for each registered Web Service, the

persistently linked Reso urce Ontology, and infer if a  user's semantic query matches the semantic 

description of the service.  

 

Figure 15 -  Result of the translation from data  model to Resource O ntology  

(us ing the developed v isualization tool)  

In 2007, the W3C submission “Semantic Annotations for WSDL and XML Schema (SAW SDL)
14

 

officially reached the W3C Recommendation status. This very light -weight standard suggests the 

use of the modelReference attribute to relate elements in XML schema (as well as elements in  

WSDL documents, which is not (yet) of interest for the OGC community)  to concepts in 

knowledge mo dels. The standard does not define the language used for the knowledge models,  

nor does it  prescribe the complexity of the model. It  can be as simple as a  controlled vocabulary  

or a Topic Map or as complex as an ontology. Having an URI ( see section 2.1.1  ) as unique 

identifier for the concepts in the knowledge model is the only prerequisite.  

The SAW SDL standard suggests two additional attributes to enable a mapping bet ween the 

language used to model the ontologies and the original data schema. If included, the two 

attributes liftingSchemaMapping  an d loweringSchemaMapping can point to XSLT 

documents which enable automatic transformation between two schemas (assuming the 

ontologies are encoded in a XML-based language). This transformation is addressing the data 

entities, which makes it  possible to transform data coming from a service into entities processable  

by the reasoning algorithm. The potential benefits for applications which have to consider data  

quality and processin g of data in general are enormous, but discussin g this is clearly o ut of scope 

for this article. Examples how to add SAW SDL model references to existing data schemas an d 

the implications on existing OGC standards, are further discussed in section 1).

The annotation process can be supported using graphical tools (see figure 14). Within the 

Reso urce Ontology we have the concept EXPLOITATIONSPONCTUALSPRODUCTION which has 

several relations to other concepts representing the attributes. Two concepts, the YEAR and the 

ALLOWEDPRODUCTION, have been related to concepts in the (global) domain ontology. The user  

is able to simply add domain concepts to the view, and establishing either an annotation link 

between  service concepts and domain concepts (the red lines), or relations between domain  

concepts (the black lines). In this example we have now formally specified that the value of the 

attribute allowedproduction is representing the  PRODUCTIONCAPACITY of the Quarry, 

measured in T ONSPERYEAR. The YEAR, which is the negative exponent of the Unit Tons per 

year,  is the value of the attribute year.

2.2.3  Level 2 - Geospatial Processes 

The description of type signatures (the input/output types) is a crucial part of functional 

descriptions. It  ensures syntactic interoperability between requester and a Web Service an d 

therefore guarantees that a Web Service can process the provided inp ut type and that a requester 

can accept the delivered o utput type. Such  descriptions can be realised usin g annotations with 

Reso urce Ontologies as described in previously (section 2.2.2  ). 

The called, respectively requested, operation has to be linked to the appropriate concept 

representing the operation to make its interpretation unambiguo us. The different overlay 

operations on polygons (difference, symmetric difference, intersection, and union) have all equal 

type signatures and equal constraints. Additionally, their input and output polygons adhere to a 

common spatial reference system. It  is therefore impossible  to distinguish them just by  

considering (even sophisticated) descriptions of input and output types. Having a  unique domain  

concept like DIFFERENCE or UNION (along descriptions attached to the concepts) associated 

makes the signature of the WPS better understandable.  

Annotations from process descriptions in the OGC Capabilities Document, respectively in the 

WPS DescribeProcess-response can be established in a similar way as described in sections 2.2.1   

and 2.2.2  .  

Additionally, depending on the chosen logic, constraints on service inputs, and dependencies 

between the in- and outputs may be formally specified. To ensure that the Web Service really  

processed the provided input in the intended way, constraints which further narrow down the 

possible input and output values are required. For example, a WPS computing the difference of 

two polygons requires all input values (besides being of type polygon) to adhere to a common 

coordinate reference system. A slightly more complex problem, the possible permutations of the 

input variables, does additionally require to formalize the dependency between output and input. 

If we only annotate the inputs, outputs, and the operations using axioms defined in  the Reso urce 

Ontology, we are not yet able to express such relationships. It  would be impossible to distinguish  

between Difference(A,B) and Difference(B,A), although their results are quite different. 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 36 

 Modellin g these dependencies is unfortunately quite complex, and is illustrated here only for 

the sake of completeness. The intended module within WSMO to capture such dependencies is 

the WebService,  with pre- and postconditions and shared variables. In the preconditions the 

required input is formalized usin g axioms, the same is performed for the output. Shared variable  

are used in both, the pre- and postcondition. An adapted reasoning engine is no w able to consider  

dependencies, using the already mentioned extended Plug-In Match. The following figure has a  

complete example for the annotation of a WPS using the WebService component.  

 

2.2.4  Level 3 - Data Entities 

Similar techniques as the one used for annotating data models ( see section 2.2.2  ) can be applied 

to annotate data entities like feature instances. Supporting annotations on this level seems to be 

only useful for feature data provided by an OGC WFS. The structure of the language used to 

encode the data (GML)  is predefined in the associated XML schema. Havin g additional 

attributes therefore requires modifications of this schema. This is discussed in detail in section 

3.3.2  , p.45.  

User interfaces supporting annotations on the instance level have to let the user attach links of 

concept definitions directly to features on a map. From a technical perspective there is no 

difference bet ween annotating data models or data entities. The same technique an d user interface 

strategy as discussed in section 2.2.2  (p. 32) can therefore be applied to annotate features.   

2.3  Comparing the capabilities of the three approaches 

We compiled a summary of the advantages and drawbacks of the three levels in a table, which is 

available as Appendix B starting on page 50. Note that we were only able to collect experience on 

semantic annotations of data models and processes. We are not aware of every potential argument 

in favor or in opposition to t he individual techniques. As o utcome to the discussion

reference documentation which guides the application developer through the implementation of 

geospatial applications supported by the semantic annotations.  

3. Implications for existing GIS Standards  

This section analyzes how the various standards involved in the GIS world may be affected by  

the proposed techniques, i.e. where would the use of model references fit  best, and what would be 

the benefits or drawbacks. For each of the standards covered in the follo wing subsections, the 

level of annotation that is relevant to address with that standard is considered. Metadata standards 

will mostly be used to do first and second level annotations (resp. service and data model), while  

data representation standards are the place to implement third level annotations (data instances).  

Finally, because annotating resources is useless without a way to query those annotations, 

OGC Filters, as a query encodin g standard, is the subject of the last section, and ways to express 

filters based on semantic annotations are considered. The proposals made in this section can be 

seen as grounds to build a set of best practices and change requests to generalize and harmonize 

semantic annotations across GIS standards.  

3.1  Expressing semantic annotations 

Before analyzing existing standards,  it  is best to first devise ho w semantic annotations should be 

ideally expressed.  

A semantic annotation must contain the URI of the classifying concept. That is the sole  

mandatory and sufficient piece of information needed to fully qualify the annotation. 

Extra attributes should be provided for convenience and performance, namely a label , language , 

the thesaurus URI and thesaurus label that the concept (or semantic entity in the broad sense)  

belongs to. These attributes, although not required to formally identify and process the 

annotation, are useful to implement tools that do not need to resolve and reach the p otentially 

remote concept definition, thereby offering better performance and usability.  These attributes 

should therefore be optional. 

 

As a result, a valid example (outside the scope of any standard analyzed belo w) of a semantic 

annotation would be (using the GEMET thesaurus 15) : 

 

<annotation  conceptUri=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/4612” 

thesaurusUri=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/” 

thesaurusLabel=”GEMET - INSPIRE Themes, Version 1.0” 

lang=”en”> 

    Land Cover 

                                                                            

15
 In this GEM ET example, and others further do wn, the th esaurus URI is set to ht tp://www.eion et.europ a.eu/gemet/ 

, although the right valu e is unclear fro m available onlin e resources.  

http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/


OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 38 

</annotation> 

 

where thesaurusUri, thesaurusLabel, lang and the element content (i.e. the concept label) are 

optional, i.e. the minimal valid annotation would be :  

<annotation conceptUri=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/4612”/> 

 

The example above assumes that the annotation element is located within  the element being 

annotated. Like for example in the OGC capabilities a Keyword element is located within the 

Service element being annotated. 

If this is not the case, and the annotation stands on its own, then it must also hold a reference to 

the entity being annotated, i.e. (re-using the minimal annotation above) : 

<annotation conceptUri=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/4612” 

            annotatedElement=”http://server/element/1234”/>  

This assumes that the elements being annotated can be referenced by URI, too. 

Standards analyzed belo w will always present the first case, i.e. the annotation being included 

within the annotated element. The second case presented in the previous paragraph will therefore 

not be considered further.  

 

Each standard belo w will be analyzed to see to what extent it  can contain such an entity, and what 

changes or workarounds wo uld be required to do so, if any. 

Related work at the W3C is also worth considerin g in the scope of this Best Practice : 

http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/ssn/wiki/Report_Work_on_Semantic_Markup  . 

3.2  Metadata standards 

Vario us organizations introduced standards for metadata, both for geospatial data and service s. In  

this section we review standards of three common fields: ISO/TC211 metadata standards, the 

service capabilities as defined by OGC, an d ebRIM, as introduced by OASIS.  

3.2.1  ISO 19115 & 19119 

ISO 19139, as the encoding standard for metadata compliant to ISO 19115/19119, is the first 

standard to consider when includin g the references needed for semantic annotations. Looking at 

the whole ISO 19139 structure, the most appropriate place to introduce Level 1 semantic 

references seems to be the gmd:MD_Keywords element. This element is meant to hold sequences 

of keywords, using keyword e lements, and with extra attributes definin g the context, such as the 

type or thesaurusName.  

 

<gmd:MD_Keywords> 

 <gmd:keyword> 

  <gco:CharacterString>keyword1</gco:CharacterString> 

 </gmd:keyword> 

http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat


OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 39 

   <gmd:keyword> 

     <gco:CharacterString>keyword2</gco:CharacterString> 

   </gmd:keyword> 

   <gmd:type> 

     <gmd:MD_KeywordTypeCode 

        codeList=<anyURI> 

        codeListValue=<anyURI>/> 

   </gmd:type> 

   <gmd:thesaurusName> ... </gmd:thesaurusName> 

</gmd:MD_Keywords> 

Listing 3 - ISO 19139 S tructure 

  

 

This ISO19139 structure can be used without modifications to hold semantic references to 

concepts from a given ontology. If we assume that (see section 2.2.1  ) any concept can be 

uniquely referenced by a URI that can be split  as a base URI an d a concept ID: 

<ontologyURIBase>             <conceptId> 

e.g.  

for HTTP  URIs:  http://www.example.com/Ontology#    QUARRY 

for URNs:        urn:x-test:landtypes:                   CROPS 

Listing 4 - U nique Identifiers  

Then the keyword elements can be used to hold the concept names describing the resource, and 

the codeList attribute of the type element can be used to hold the URI of the ontology containing 

the concepts. Using this approach, the following ISO19139 excerpt would contain valid 

references to such concepts
16

 (Guidelines regardin g the proper use of the type and 

thesaurusName elements are needed to ensure that this approach is valid).

However, it would be better suited to be able to define keywords belonging to various thesauri, 

each having its own URI. To this end, the gmx:Anchor element (defined to point to  registered 

definitions, according to the ISO specification, and usable as a substitute for 

CharacterString) is better suited (here using the GEMET thesaurus for the sake of the 

example) :  

<gmd:MD_Keywords> 

 <gmd:keyword> 

    <gmx:Anchor 

        xlink:href=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/4612”> 

         Land Cover

          GEMET - INSPIRE Themes, Version 1.0 

       </gmx:Anchor> 

 </gmd:thesaurusName> 

</gmd:MD_Keywords> 

Listing 6 - Concrete Example of ISO 19139 Str ucture  

Here we see that the gmx:Anchor element provides a way to substitute a mere string with a 

qualified and labeled entity (concept or thesaurus) . It  thereby fulfills the requirements for the 

abstract annotation element described in section 3.1  . 

Regardin g semantic annotations at the second and third level (data models and entities), model 

references have to be introduced as explicit  metadata element. ISO 19115 foresees two options 

for this: 

The abstract element MD_ContentInformation could point  to ontological descriptions. 

Coverages an d feature catalogue descriptions are currently the only non-abstract children of the 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 41 

MD_ContentInformation class. Both provide potential extension points to include 

characteristic parameters and natural language descriptions for feature types and properties. 

Neither follows the distinction between information objects and models of the world.  An  

interesting option would be to include a third class “MD_Reference” to this branch of metadata 

elements, which could contain explicit  pointers to resource or domain ontologies.  

The element MD_ApplicationSchemaInformation could also be used to link to 

ontologies. It  offers the possibility to refer to an application schema used for a specific data  

encoding. Follo wing ISO 19139, this is usually the XSD specifying the encoding of geospatial 

information items. Once a pointer to such implementation model is available, semantic 

annotations can be established from there. Details considering this approach are given in section 

3.3  . This approach would not require any change of the recent metadata standards, but a specifi c  

implementing rule. 

3.2.2  OWS Capabilities 

To be able to efficiently describe and discover services using semantic annotations, the OWS 

specification must be considered. The OWS Common specification is common to several OGC 

services (WCS, WFS, CSW, …) and defines the way a service can advertise its content, mainly 

through the specification of the GetCapabilities  operation response. Again, a  Level 1  

semantic annotation could be established using key words.  

Using Keywords 

The definition of the content of a GetCapability response reproduces partially the ISO19139 

structure described above in its ows:Keywords  element. In particular, the type e lement is 

mapped into a ows:CodeType xml element that retains the properties needed for the approach 

described in the previous section. 

Therefore, as a direct consequence, we can apply the same approach to the OWS Capabilities; 

usin g this approach, the GetCapabilities document of an OGC service wo uld look like  the 

followin g: 

 

<ows:ServiceIdentification> 

  <ows:Title>Some WFS Service</ows:Title> 

  <ows:Keywords> 

    <ows:Keyword>Quarry</ows:Keyword> 

    <ows:Keyword>brgm</ows:Keyword> 

    <ows:Type codeSpace=”http://www.example.com/Ontology#”> 

  ontology 

    </ows:Type> 

  </ows:Keywords> 

  <ows:ServiceType>WFS</ows:ServiceType> 

  <ows:ServiceTypeVersion>1.1.0</ows:ServiceTypeVersion> 

</ows:ServiceIdentification> 

Listing 7 - Annotation of the GetCapabilities-Document 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 42 

 

Here the Keywords  element is sho wn as part of the ServiceIdentification e lement, i.e. the 

service description. It  can also be used at the level of resources of the services, e.g. feature types 

for the WFS, coverage offerings for the WCS, process descriptions for the WPS, and more. 

It  must be noted that there can be only one ‘Type’ element per ‘Keywords’ section, hence having 

all keywords within a ‘Keywords’ section belonging to the same thesaurus (if any). If keywords 

from different thesauri are needed, multiple ‘Key words’ sections can be used.  

This construct is not as flexible as the abstract annotation element defined above. In particular, 

there is no way to express a conceptURI that is not an extension of its thesaurusURI. Therefore, a 

change request should be issued to add the ability to have full-fledged annotations in OGC 

capabilities, i.e. having each a mandatory concept  URI, and optional label, language and 

thesaurus URI/label. Much like what gmx:Anchor offers. 

3.2.3  WMS Capabilities 

This approach is valid for all  OGC services, with one noticeable exception, though: the WMS 

specification, as per its 1.3.0 version, does not comply with the OWS Common specification. As 

a result, the Keywords element is replaced by a KeywordList element, and the Type element 

does not exist. 

The WMS specification should comply with the OWS Common specification by its next 

version. In the mean time, if the WMS specification in its current state must be used with 

semantic references, the only way is to use the vocabulary attribute available on each Keyword  

element, defined by the specification as “an attribute to indicate the defining authority for that 

keyword”. The Keyword content would then be the concept URI. Therefore, the semantic 

annotation becomes : 

 

<WMS_Capabilities version="1.3.0"> 

<Service> 

<Name>WMS</Name> 

  <Title> Some WMS Service </Title> 

     <KeywordList> 

<Keyword vocabulary=”http://example.com/Ontology#”> 

http://example.com/Ontology#Quarry 

</Keyword> 

<Keyword vocabulary=”http://example.com/Ontology#”> 

http://example.com/Ontology#BRGM 

</Keyword> 

  </KeywordList> 

Listing 8 - M etadata Annotation for WMS  

 However, this scheme prevents the expression of the concept label. This is a limitation of the 

WMS capabilities as they stand today. 



OGC 08-167r2

Using MetadataUrl 

The WFS and WMS specifications define a MetadataUrl element that provides a link to 

metadata documents describing respectively FeatureTypes and MapLayers. Such MetadataUrl  

elements have a format attribute defining the metadata format; its values are taken from a finite 

set, containing e.g. ISO19115 or FGDC.  This element can be used to provide links to documents 

that describe the resource semantically. This kind of semantic annotation would not be a mere 

model reference linking between entities and concepts as described earlier, but a reference to a 

full ontology including these concepts. In the case of a feature type, such ontology can be used to 

semantically annotate the feature type structure, as described in section 2.2.1   (p. 31). To achieve 

this, more formats should be added to the format attribute value set, such as RDF,  OWL, SKOS 

or WSML.  

 

<wfs:WFS_Capabilities version="1.1.0"> 

<FeatureTypeList> 

    <FeatureType> 

<Name>rivers</Name> 

<MetadataURL type="0" format="rdf/xml"> 

http://example.com/ontology#rivers 

</MetadataURL> 

</FeatureType> 

Listing 9 - Using  the MetadataURL for the feature types in a WFS 

 

3.2.4  ebXML 

Previous sections described how to add model references to metadata documents. However, for 

this to be useful, semantic annotations must be handled properly by the components that index 

such metadata documents. So, although ebXML is not a metadata representation language per se,  

it  is the model used to represent metadata in one of the two CSW profile specifications
17

. This 

section will thus discuss ebXML an d see ho w it can be used to efficiently  store such semantic 

annotations. 

                                                                            

17
  The oth er C SW profile (ISO AP), based on the ISO19115 specification, c an follo w the recommendations mad e in 

section 3.2.1  .  



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 44 

The ClassificationNode an d Classification  elements in the ebRIM specification can 

be used to store respectively concepts and semantic annotations, with all the information 

described in section 3.1  , and this is how they are used already in the CSW ebRIM profile. 

Therefore, the CSW ebRIM profile in its current definition already holds the functionality needed 

to represent model references. 

However, as a recommendation, it  would be good to suggest that semantic annotations as 

proposed in the previous sections (ISO19115, Capabilities) be harvested by CSW ebRIM catalogs 

by representing the model references usin g the ClassificationNode and Classification  

ebRIM elements. That way, semantic annotations contained in the metadata harvested in a catalog 

wo uld be explicitly expressed as such and are therefore query-able  in an efficient way. Examples 

of such querying will be provided in sect ion 3.4   regarding OGC Filters.  

 

3.3  Data representation standards 

The previous section explored how to use semantic references in metadata documents describin g 

GIS reso urces. Taggin g reso urces can also be done at a finer -grained level,  as described in  

sections 2.2.2  to 2.2.4  . To achieve that, we will now consider data representation standards, and 

how techniques proposed in previous sections can be applied to them. 

3.3.1  GML Schema 

As explained in section 2.1.2  , XML schemas can be augmented with semantic annotations usin g 

the SA-WSDL standard, which suggests to add a  modelReference attribute to XML element 

type definitions. Since GML schemas are instances of XML schemas, the same proposal can be 

applied here as well. Here is an example of a  GML schema where the SA-W SDL proposal is 

applied to annotate the schema (for the sake of conciseness, the ontology complete URI is 

replaced by the XML entity &quarries;) : 

 

<element name=”exploitationsponctualsproduction” 

     type=” exploitationsponctualsproductionType” 

   sawsdl:modelReference="&quarries;exploitationFeatureType"> 

<complexType name="exploitationsponctualsproductionType">              

 <complexContent> 

  <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType"> 

   <sequence> 

    <element name="msGeometry" type="gml:GeometryPropertyType" 

   sawsdl:modelReference="&quarries;QuarryLocation"/> 

    <element name="name" type="string"/> 

    <element name="year" type="string" 

          sawsdl:modelReference="&quarries;Year"/> 

  <element name="allowedproduction" type="string"/> 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 45 

   sawsdl:modelReference="&quarries;Community"/> 

   </sequence> 

  </extension> 

 </complexContent> 

</complexType> 

Listing 10 -  Applying SAWSDL to GM L Schema  

 

In this example, one can see how the modelReference attribute is used to semantically annotate 

both the feature type itself, and some of its elements. In terms of specification, this piece of XML 

schema is valid, since any attribute can be added to elements such as xs:complexType or  

xs:element.  

Again, here modelReference offers the minimal expressivity described in 3.1  , i.e.  the URI.  

The additional attributes (label, language, ...) are not available, and would re quire a different 

construct. However, it  is arguable that GML schemas need such convenience attributes, as they 

are mostly meant for machine processing. 

3.3.2  GML instances 

As explained in section 2.1.4   (p.30), the most fine-grained option to semantically annotate data 

is to do it  at the level of each feature. To achieve that in  GML data, one can add to its feature 

type’s specific attributes to hold model references for each data instance. In this example, a 

modelReference attribute is added to the type of stone provided by a quarry:  

 

<complexType name="quarries"> 

 <complexContent> 

  <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType"> 

   <sequence> 

    […] 

    <element name="allowedproduction" type=”anyURI”/> 

   </sequence> 

  </extension> 

 </complexContent> 

</complexType> 

Listing 11 -  Applying SAWSDL to GM L-encoded Data Entities  

 

Such a  solution simply adds a feature attribute that can hold anyURI .This is enough to carry the 

semantic annotations, but a stronger-typed solution may be better, such as:  

 

<xs:simpleType name="modelReference"> 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 46 

 <xs:restriction base="anyURI"/> 

</xs:simpleType>   

 

<complexType name="exploitationsponctualsproductionType"> 

 <complexContent> 

  <extension base="gml:AbstractFeatureType"> 

   <sequence> 

   ...     

    <element  name="allowedproduction" 

          type=”gml:modelReference”/> 

   </sequence> 

  </extension> 

 </complexContent> 

</complexType> 

Listing 12 -  A stronger-typed solution for applying SAWSDL  

By explicitly definin g an attribute as being a modelReference,  component storing such data  

(e.g. a WFS) will be able to properly index it  for further querying.  

3.3.3  SensorML 

It  is useful to consider here the SensorML specification, where a similar problem has been tackled 

at various levels. In this specification, several types of elements need to be semantically 

annotated, namely observable properties and processes.  

As a result, several constructs are available to express semantic annotations.  

First, the AbstractDataComponentType element type is the abstract type parent of all data 

components and observable properties, and has an optional definition attribute, of type 

anyURI,  defined as “pointing to semantics information defining the precise nature of the 

component”:  

 

 

 

 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 47 

Then, the process can be described using process metadata groups. These metadata group s can  

hold so-called identifiers  and classifiers, that can refer to semantic entities defined in external 

ontologies (see SensorML specification, OGC 07-000, sec. 8.11). They can also contain 

keywords qualified by a codespace, as in OW S Common capabilities.  

<xs:complexType name="AbstractDataComponentType" abstract="true"> 

    <xs:complexContent> 

        <xs:extension base="gml:AbstractGMLType"> 

            ... 

            <xs:attribute name="definition" 

                          type="xs:anyURI" use="optional"> 

                <xs:annotation> 

       <xs:documentation> 

      Points to semantics information defining the 

      precise nature of the component 

                  </xs:documentation> 

     </xs:annotation> 

            </xs:attribute> 

        </xs:extension> 

    /xs:complexContent> 

</xs:complexType>

</classification>

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 48 

As an example of such annotations, with a classifier referring to the ESA OrbitTypes dictionary : 

 

 

The Term element used here is defined in the SensorML specification, and contains 

- a definition attribute  that can hold the concept URI 

- an optional codespace sub-element that can contain the thesaurus URI  

- a value subelement that can contain the concept label 

 

Sen sorML therefore already has several means to specify model references, complying with the 

minimal constraints expressed in this document. However, it  must be noted that some optional 

elements described in  section 3.1  are not supported : identifier an d classifier elements do not 

provide a way to express the label lan guage, wh ile the definition attribute of 

AbstractDataComponentType only supports the expression of the concept URI. 

3.3.4  KML 

KML itself is a standard to formally encode simple features without explicit  definitions of their 

attributes. We consider KML to be a lightweight example of GML instances; the problems 

identified there are therefore also valid for KML. It is not an option to extend the KML schema in 

a way to include the semantic annotations. But in version 2.2.0 of the OGC KML specification, 

the ExtendedData field provides a flexible way to annotate existing features (e.g. the whole 

Document, individual Placemarks or their collections, the Folders) . The following example shows 

that a Placemark can be annotated with a domain reference linking to a concept from a shared 

domain vocabulary 

<Placemark> 

  <name>Münster</name> 

  <ExtendedData> 

    <Data name="http://purl.org/net/concepts/domainReference"> 

    <value> 

      http://www.geonames.org#Muenster 

    </value> 

    </Data> 

  </ExtendedData> 

</Placemark> 

Listing 14 -  Semantic Annotations in KML 

 

Note that the value of the attribute “name” has to include either the model reference URI (if a  

resource ontology exist which is specific for this particular KML file) or the domain reference 

URI.  Only the reference URI specifics that we have a semantic reference, the URI itsel f therefore 

has to be agreed upon beforehand.   



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 49 

3.3.5  Contexts 

The Web Map Context  specification (as per version 1.1 ) defines a KeywordList element, but 

which can contain a mere list of string keywords. It does not provide any mean to express the 

thesaurus URI separately from the concept names. Therefore, the only way to use concept 

references to tag a context is to use full concepts URIs in the keywords list, as in: 

 

<ViewContext version="1.1.0">  

<General> 

  ... 

 <KeywordList> 

   <Keyword>http://www.example.com/Ontology#Quarry</Keyword> 

   <Keyword>http://www.example.com/Ontology#BRGM</Keyword> 

 </KeywordList> 

Listing 15 -  Semantic Annotations in a Context document  

This is not very strong typed,  and does not offer a way to express optional attributes described 

in section 3.1  . 

Future Context specification 

A new Context specification is being defined and should be ready by end of 2011. This new 

specification builds on the Atom format. As a result, semantic annotations in that format will 

certainly reuse the ‘category’ element available in the Atom spec, i.e.  

<feed>  

 ... 

<entry> 

   <category term=”Quarry” scheme=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/” /> 

   <category term=”Quarry” scheme=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/” /> 

Listing 16 -  Semantic Annotations in a n Atom-based Context document 

The category element, as per the Atom specification, contains a way to express the attributes 

described in section 3.1  (apart from the thesaurus label) . As an example, here’s how one can 

define a category with all those attributes in use :  

<category term=”  http://www.eionet.eu.int/gemet/concept/4612” 
              scheme=”http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/” 

              label=”Land Cover” 

             xml:lang=”EN” /> 

Here the term attribute is used to hold the full concept URI,  although the Atom specification 

originally intends it to be a mere string code defined in the scope of the thesaurus. 



OGC 08-167r2 

         Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 50 

The Atom category element does not provide a way to express the thesaurus la bel ; this is 

something to investigate and suggest to the OGC Context group.  

3.4  OGC Filters  

Assuming that there exist s data and metadata annotated with semantic references, one must be 

able to discover them efficiently. If we consider only the OGC services, expressing queries to 

discover data is mainly done usin g OGC Filters.  

The OGC Filter Encodin g Standard does not provide means to express semantic concept 

matching, not to mention semantic predicates validation. The only operator that comes close to 

this is in the CQL specification, part of the Catalogue specification, where an optional 

ClassifiedAs operator is defined, although it  is not meant to references concepts by URI, as 

wo uld be needed in the scope of this discussion. So, to be able to discover data tagged with 

semantic references, a proposal is made to add specific operators to the OGC Filter specification.  

3.4.1  The ClassifiedAs-Operator 

The first operator that would be needed is an operator similar to the ClassifiedAs operator in 

CQL, but taking a concept URI as parameter. This operator would take a property name as first 

argument arg1, and a concept URI as second argument arg2.  It  wo uld return the boolean true  

value if the value of arg1 references a concept that is equivalent or is a subclass of the concept 

defined by arg2. In terms of XML schema, this can be defined as part of the Filter.xsd schema 

as: 

 

<xsd:element name="ClassifiedAs" 

             type="ogc:ClassifiedAsType" 

             substitutionGroup="ogc:comparisonOps"/> 

<xsd:complexType name="ClassifiedAsType"> 

 <xsd:complexContent> 

     <xsd:extension base="ogc:ComparisonOpsType"> 

        <xsd:sequence> 

           <xsd:element ref="ogc:expression"/> 

             <xsd:element name="concept" type="xsd:anyURI"/> 

   </xsd:sequence> 

  </xsd:extension> 

 </xsd:complexContent> 

 </xsd:complexType> 

Listing 17 -  How to apply  the ClassifiedAs O perator  

 



OGC 08-167r2 

Copyright © 2012 Open Geospatial Consortium. 51 

This definition can be enhanced by declaring the concept element as a new type, e.g. 

ConceptRefType, wh ich would explicitly reference the concept in terms of its thesaurus URI  

and concept name. 

 

 

3.4.2  Usage  

Usage in CSW ebRIM :   

In the scope of an ebRIM catalog, the ClassifiedAs operator can be used to match records that 

are subject to a classification, where the classified object  is the first element of the operator, and 

the second element is the URI of the ClassificationNode used in the classification. It must be 

reminded here that the URI of a concept can be a URN, and in particular can be a UUID.  

Using this operator in CSW queries will help performing semantic discovery on service 

annotations, and on data model annotations: 

 

<csw:GetRecords xmlns:csw="http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw" 

  xmlns:ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc" 

  xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml" 

  version="2.0.0" outputSchema="EBRIM" maxRecords="50"> 

    <csw:Query typeNames="ExtrinsicObject"> 

        <csw:ElementName>/ExtrinsicObject</csw:ElementName> 

        <csw:Constraint version="1.0.0"><ogc:Filter> 

            <ogc:classifiedAs> 

                <ogc:PropertyName>/ExtrinsicObject</ogc:PropertName> 

                <ogc:Literal> 

          http://www.example.com/Ontology#Quarry 

      </ogc:Literal> 

            </ogc:classifiedAs> 

        </ogc:Filter> 

   </csw:Constraint> 

    </csw:Query> 

</csw:GetRecords> 

Listing 18 -   Example for ClassifiedAs Operator 

 

Usage in WFS: 

OGC Filters can be used when querying a Web Feature Service to search for features that match a 

certain concept. This implies that features have been semantically tagged, as described in section 

2.1.2   (p.28) and 3.3.1   (p.44). Assuming features are  properly annotated usin g the feature type 

schema proposed in  3.3.2  (p.45), this filter wo uld return all  quarries of the type ChalkPit or any 

subclass of it :

Listing 19 -  Using the modelReference in a WFS query  

4. Summary 

The need for better thematic descriptions of OGC Web Services is evident, and we believe that 

linking OW S an d other OGC-compliant resources to ontologies with the help of semantic 

annotations can help to address most of the problems identified in the first section. We introduced 

three different levels where the annotations can be applied: on the resource metadata level (the 

Capabilities document for OWS), the data model and processes, an d the actual data entit ies.  

The previous sections sho wed that most existing standards already provide sufficient means 

for simple semantic annotations. Agreeing on harmonized best practices (such as the many 

proposed here) wo uld be a goo d step forward to offer good semantic ann otation capabilities 

throughout the OGC stack. From what is observed in the existing standards, it  should be noted 

though that the need for semantic annotations has already been recognized at several levels an d in  

several domains (SensorML is a good example). But in the end no harmonized effort was 

conducted, which resulted in mixed and partial solutions. Perhaps such a harmonizing effort, 

preferably materialized as a definition of a unique annotation element in OGC core schemas 

(similar to the gmx:Anchor element ?), should therefore be the next step on the quest to 

semantically enable OGC Web Services.

Appendix A - Glossary  

 Annotation: Attaching descriptive metadata to a resource, with the intention to simplify 

its discovery and evaluation. 

 Data Model: Describes the structure of geospatial data, usually  in GML schema. A data 

model defines how the → data entities  have to represented.  

 Data Entity: A specific instance of data. Adheres to the structure defined in the → Data 

Model . 

 Domain Ontology: Domain-specific knowledge shared by one user community is 

usually captured in such a → global ontology.  

 Global Ontology: Ontologies capturing knowledge which needs to be shared to other 

user s are categorized as glo bal ontologies. In contrary to → local ontologies, global 

ontologies are  well maintained by information experts and are made accessible to 

everyone.  

 Knowledge Model : Conceptualizations of knowledge, structured into concepts with 

unique identifiers an d relations between the concepts. Ontologies are sophisticated forms 

of knowledge models.  

 Local O ntology: refers to application specific knowledge models like the → Resource 

Ontology. Local Ontologies are not shared, and only the service provider is responsible  

for the creation and maintenance (in contrary to → Global Ontology).  

 Model Reference: A link between an element in the schema-based metadata and a 

concept in the → knowledge model.  The model reference is used to link to an entity 

with equivalent semantics but a different encoding.  

 Ontology:  Ontologies are the most sophisticated means to structure and specify 

knowledge, either on the local level as → Resource Ontology or shared as 

→ Domain Ontology.  

 Reasoning: Machine-supported inference to gain either new knowledge out from the 

existing ontologies or to solve semantic heterogeneities.  Reasoning assumes to have the 

→ knowledge model  expressed in a lan guage processable by the algorithm.  

 Resource O ntology: Application-specific → local ontology describin g the specific  

characteristics of one particular service or data set. The → data model  of a WFS, for 

example, is fully represented in  the Reso urce Ontology (as well as the process served by 

a WPS) 

 Semantic Annotation: A specialized form of → Annotation  where the attached 

metadata is partly expressed in a formal language, which makes interpretation by a 

machine possible. → Reasoning algorithms can then support the discovery and 

evaluation.  

 Taxomony: A less structured → knowledge model , consisting of a vocabulary and one 

predefined relation between the terms.

Appendix B - Semantic Annotations in a nutshell 

In the following, we present a tentative list  of the benefits, drawbacks, an d potential application s 

for the proposed annotation at each of the three levels. This list  provides a summary of our  

findings. This list  is a first draft only, the authors expect from future discussions within th e OGC 

additional ideas to further extend this list .  

 

Level 1: Source Metadata 

Advantages: 

 Easy to implement 

 Easy to understand (also for non-experts) 

 Helps to (quickly) assess what kind of data is served  

 Needs no modification of underlying data schema 

 Much better recall then no annotation at all (due to semantic-enabled query processing)  

 Only solution for binary data like images (served by WCS or WMS)  

 Good solution for WMS (since there is no real data schema anyway)  

Drawbacks: 

 Semantic-enabled discovery resources requires specialised interfaces letting users select 

the needed concepts 

 Only week reasoning support if directly linked to domain concepts (via domain 

reference)  

 Can impair readability of service metadata 

 Consistency Problems: Changes in un derlying data model requires changes of 

annotations on metadata level 

 Not possible to identify what part of the served data represents the needed information 

Suggested Applications:  

 Service Discovery 

 Service Evaluation

Level 2: Data Models 

Advantages: 

 Higher precision and better recall since we can model the inner workings  

 More details, results in higher recall 

 We can identify which specific elements yield the requested information 

 Better assessment possible, since one can better study the data model 

 Less problem s with consistency, since changes to the data model have direct impact on 

annotations 

Drawbacks: 

 Loosing the flexibility of Level 1 – annotations 

 Describing complex data models tedio us, requires additional documentation 

 Semantic-enabled discovery resources requires specialised interfaces letting users select 

the needed concepts (but it  does have no impact on the normal, keyword-based 

discovery) 

 Annotations of processes (in a WPS) rather complex 

Suggested Applications:  

 Service Discovery  

 Service Evaluation 

 Workflow Validation

Level 3: Data Entities 

Advantages: 

 Still lightweight approach, since we still just add a modelReference attribute to entities  

 Flexible annotation of features 

 Filtering using annotations possible  

 Good solution for data without explicit  data models, i.e. application schema 

Drawbacks: 

 Needs annotation tools in the Viewer application (Desktop GIS or Web mapping tools)  

 Can be costly, due to the potential high number of entities   

 Increased data volume 

Suggested Applications:  

 Reso urce Discovery (with filtering) 

 Service Evaluation 

 Quality Control for Resources  

 Merging of Datasets
